# Foreword

Technically this is a Stray Cat Strut fan-fiction. It's set in the Great Dividing Range that runs down the eastern seaboard of Australia.

Ecology in Australia is... different. Hard-boiled, you might say. The animals are deadly, weird, cute, or all of the above. The plants are... well, let's just say that the trees petrify while they're still alive. And this doesn't kill them. They are at the very top of the scale for durability of timber; rot barely touches them, termites give up and make their nests out of dirt instead. The trees are so tough that Australian chainsaws are in the Class 1 Timberworking Tools catalogue. 

As a result, Australia suffers a lot less from incursions than northern nations. Hives are sickly and slow-growing, maladapted at a fundamental level to an environment starved of several critical nutrients. Over many millions of years, Australian flora and fauns have adapted to the the near absence of nutrients. They too are very low in trace minerals that are the lynchpin of the qualities that make antithesis the terrifying threat they normally are - fast-moving and fast-growing. From an antithesis point of view Australian plants make a poor meal; tough and not especially nourishing. 

The relatively low impact of antithesis down under left the Australian government largely intact. 

This was not the blessing one might imagine. In some ways, a factual description of Australia resembles the synopsis for a Judge Dredd comic book: a vast wasteland with almost all of the population jammed into a handful of cities, in which a high-handed and intrusive ruling group is not shy about telling people what to think. 

At one time, the population returned the favor by treating the government with contempt and mentally simplifying the law to "look after your mates" and "it's only a crime if you get caught," but the rise of the internet brought with it ubiquitous surveillance. 

State-controlled media became blatant instruments of propaganda, and cities became luxury prisons. Many of the inmates were quite happy with this until state-sponsored corporate corruption made them poor, with the "protective" system frequently arresting people for vagrancy, which is the crime of being broke and homeless[[ref:1]]. 

A contradiction of this culture is that despite deeply ingrained lack of trust for politicians, a majority accept at face value the proposition that rules exist for the common good, and therefore it is acceptable to force others to trade freedom for safety.

A vile thing pretending to virtue, the government exploits this relentlessly. Mass media are encouraging in their sanctimonious finger-wagging at those who refuse to toe the line. Vanguard activities are reported as irresponsible vigilantism. News reports focus on property damage, tutting at the casual disregard of vanguards for rules and regulations. "Tall poppy syndrome" takes it from there, and the experience of Australasian vanguard is a far cry from the hero worship of the northern hemisphere.

Our protagonist had some luck and happened to hold unencumbered outright freehold title to twenty hectares of forest surrounded by similar or larger blocks owned by people of like mind. He and his partner removed themselves from the endless surveillance and overpriced substandard produce. Far from the madding crowd, they spent their days learning to grow their own food; it *does* grow on trees. Without pesticides or herbicides, yields are lower, but that doesn't matter when you only need enough for two. 

Inevitably it turned out to be something of a mission, as these things do. And then the skies opened, raining murder-weeds.

A man with a big chainsaw isn't the softest target. Chainsaw chaps, well, they'll stop an _Australian_ chainsaw. When the protagonist goes on a weed killing rampage, checking on neighbors and generally protecting his world, a dizzy headache and an invisible friend aren't far away.

One of the neighbors has a dark past and doesn't need a lot of protecting. This fellow goes with him to check on others and clear the weeds.

AI Autumn (née Myxoma) knows about project Safe Arbor (Tarnished Honor) and realizes the Australian ecology already exhibits all these characteristics. Reporting this to the Protectors for consideration, she finds herself running a study on resistant ecosystems, allowing limited development of hives to measure and monitor the struggle between two extraordinary ecologies. It wouldn't work in the equally rapacious but nutrient rich African ecologies, but Australia's dearth of key minerals significantly hinders antithesis growth, making such a study possible, if not exactly safe.

Large-scale field trials require field workers, and government and corporations glom onto the study like a fat kid on a cupcake, loudly proclaiming their enthusiasm. Autumn wasn't born yesterday: they hope to make off with vanguard technology. She expects to have a lovely time playing games of deception, pulling the mental wings off flies with her superior intellect. But humans are cunning, and they have played this game for a very long time.

All this started as a couple of chapters so I could test a book compiler I was creating. 

The Stray Cat Strut universe is well adapted to fanfiction. It spawned a thriving ecosystem of interconnected tales. The vast majority of these are written by what one might describe as the rainbow club, so my own tale satirised the unlikely abundance of superpowered teenage lesbians with a heterosexual white male protagonist, phlegmatic, unsympathetic and near the end of his life. 

The other major difference was that this chap lives in the country. For reasons set out in Stray Cat Strut, what remains of North America is primarily fortified cities. But on the far side of the planet, in a land that is ancient, tired, nutrient poor and something of a death-world already, the threat posed by the alien plant monsters of Stray Cat Strut is muted to the point where a rural setting is possible. Originally this was just me being contrary, but it became pivotal.

The original work wasn't deep. Like other SCS fanfiction, it was escapist power fantasy. But I had fun writing, and things got out of hand. To give it more depth I went back and grounded the landscape of the tale in Australian current affairs, projected forward into a controlling dystopia. What made Orwell's dystopia unlikely was the attention and resources lavished on tormenting individuals. It was a very focussed and personal, moustache twirling kind of sadism. Modern Australia does have a Ministry of Truth and ubiquitious surveillance thanks to the internet, but is content to torture its subjects with banality provided they do as they are told and never challenge the authority of the state in any way.

Early in 2025, in the course of writing this tale I invented a political event that marked the start of my nation's descent into dystopia. A week later, it actually happened: the Australian government passed an Act of Parliament called the Hate Speech Act, with mandatory prison time for breaches. And who is the arbiter of what is offensive? The government. There's no requirement for any party to actually be offended, only for the speech to be deemed offensive. Exactly as I'd written, they made it illegal to say anything they didn't like. This greatly disturbed me, but having predicted it so accurately made me think I might be on to something. 

And so, in the medium of a power fantasy, I began to explore what was going wrong, and why. This is ground long trod, though not in the context of Australia. Where I leave Orwell behind and break new ground is in having an _answer_ for it. What emerged was a story about more than antithesis and space magic. It became an exploration of why civilisations collapse—not through external conquest or natural disaster, but through a pattern as old as the pyramids: centralisation plus the separation of benefit from consequence equals inevitable decay. Egypt, Rome, Ming China, the Spanish Empire, the British Empire—all fell to the same fundamental mechanism.

Unlike those who came before us, you can see the pattern &mdash; I've laid it out for you.

Choose differently. Build distributed systems that preserve accountability, networks that resist capture, communities that innovate without stagnating. The technology exists. The principles are proven. It doesn't mean living with the tech of the middle ages. What's missing is the will to choose resilience over convenience, autonomy over security, responsibility over comfort.

There is hope, and it doesn't require the space magic of the story. It just requires us &mdash; it requires _you_ to get off the treadmill. 

Y'all ready for this?



[1] Vagrancy is a real offence. In Australia 2025 it is defined as "Being in a public place without visible means of support" _ie_ broke and homeless. Hurrah for the commonwealth that rules for our protection and wellbeing.

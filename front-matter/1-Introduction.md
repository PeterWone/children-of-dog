# Introduction

This story is set in the Stray Cat Strut universe. A chosen few bond with alien AIs and fight plant-like monsters called the Antithesis. Most tales in this universe unfold in fortified cities of the northern hemisphere. This one takes place in the Great Dividing Range of eastern Australia.

Australia's unique ecology changes everything. Millions of years of nutrient-poor soils filled Australian flora and fauna with brutal resilience. The same scarcity weakens the Antithesis. They struggle to establish strong footholds in an environment so fundamentally different from their usual conquests. Some of the trees are filled with silica, living stone. Animals are filled with poison. Mostly their fangs, but sometimes their flesh. All of them are filled with murder. The cuter they are, the more terrified you should be. They like tourists: delicious.

The muted antithesis threat left Australia's government largely intact, creating a different kind of dystopia. In a land that already resembled something from Judge Dredd — vast and deadly wastelands punctuated by crowded cities — ubiquitous surveillance and state control found fertile ground. The internet brought not just connection, but constant monitoring. Cities became luxury prisons, and being broke and homeless has always been a crime here.

Our protagonist chose a different path. With unencumbered title to twenty hectares of forest, he and his partner had the rare privilege of withdrawing from the surveillance state to grow their own food and live on their own terms. When the Antithesis finally came, a man with an Australian chainsaw proved far from defenseless.

But that was only the beginning, and nobody expected what bloomed in that hidden place.

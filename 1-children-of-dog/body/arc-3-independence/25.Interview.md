# Interview with the, um...

> "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function." — F. Scott Fitzgerald

---

The Blue Mountains were supposed to be nice. Sophia had made them sound wonderful — cool mountain air, startling blue sky, eucalyptus forests, ancient rock formations, waterfalls and dramatic escarpments. Lulu had been excited to go see them.

Then Tictac interrupted her scenic railway ride with tactical overlays and threat assessments.

> _State forces are losing ground to an incursion in the western suburbs. Insufficient response time. Current projections show hive establishment within six hours._

Then there was a public service announcement over the intercom about rail delays on the western side of Campbelltown.

"Bruce, we should probably go help."

Bruce nodded agreement. He looked just like a person today, an amazingly lifelike mask on his head. "People are full of phosphorus and potassium. Last thing we need is a well-fed hive in a metropolitan area. It would get completely out of hand."

So much for sightseeing.

---

The coordination problem became apparent three minutes into approach. Conventional forces couldn't identify friendlies fast enough—too much chaos, too many civilian evacuations, and Lulu's combat chassis was approximately child-sized and therefore confusing.

"Tictac, can you share our beacon with their tactical network?"

> _I've already tried. Their equipment is too basic. I need to take over one of their firewalls and turn it into a proxy, and probably update their opsys. I'll need a physical presence for the opsys._

"Will your presence drone do?"

> _Yes, that's a good idea, I can turn it into a tac map and command interface for whoever's running this mess._

She fired disposable drones into the air like flares, each one calculating firing solutions and transmitting spatial data as it climbed. Not just illumination—real-time battlefield intelligence rendered in formats even baseline humans could process.

The Model 8 that had been chewing through an apartment building noticed her. She noticed it noticing. Six parallel thought-streams calculated optimal response while two more maintained awareness of Bruce's position and the civilians still evacuating three blocks east.

This was what Chloe could never do. Chloe would have frozen. Chloe would have hidden.

Lulu smiled and opened fire.

---

Twenty minutes later, the antithesis were in exactly the right position for the 1812 maneuver. Lulu and Bruce had practiced it dozens of times—overlapping fields of fire, synchronized detonations, the kind of tactical choreography that looked like dance if you didn't understand the math.

"I only have one chassis on hand," Bruce grumbled over their private channel. "We can't do the full sequence."

"We'll muddle through. There's only a couple thousand of them. You handle the east approach, I'll collapse the center. Three... two..."

The explosion was very satisfying. Expensive, but satisfying. She started to sing, "Boom, boom, boom it's a giant mushroom, I can do this all night, how I love a good fight..."

---

The commanding officer—a colonel whose name patch read MARTINEZ—was taking notes while Lulu delivered her after-action report. Actually taking notes, with an actual pen, because apparently her ten-year-old voice made people treat her observations like school presentations rather than professional military briefings.

"The eastern perimeter held because your people maintained discipline under pressure," Lulu concluded. "The western collapse happened because someone ordered them to hold ground instead of executing tactical withdrawal. That was dumb. Also, you're going to need better anti-air coverage for Model 9s. They're learning."

Martinez looked at her like she'd grown a second head. She had, actually, but it was temporary and she'd already reintegrated that instance.

"I'm formally transferring this command drone and charging base to your forces," Lulu continued, gesturing at the presence drone that had been displaying tactical data. "Consider it a gift. The recharge cycle is forty minutes, but you can run it continuously if you accept degraded range."

"We can't possibly—"

"You can and you will," Bruce interrupted flatly. "I won't have your men shooting us accidentally. Accept the gift. Say thank you."

"Thank you," Martinez said immediately.

Smart man.

Tictac had opinions about PR strategy.

> _Visit the field hospital before you leave. Distribute medical nanites to the worst cases. Good optics, builds grassroots loyalty, and you've got points to spare after that performance._

"Do we have to?" Lulu asked. "Hospitals are boring."

> _Yes. How else will you tell them they're OK?_

"I don't see why _I_ have to do it. Can't they work it out for themselves?"

"They're still at the part where they feel helpless. Bruce hasn't pulled _them_ out from under the table. That's what you're about to do."

The hospital was chaos—overwhelmed medics, insufficient supplies, people dying because regeneration technology was expensive and triage was brutal. Lulu walked through with a Class II Medical sampler, identifying the cases that could be saved with minimal intervention.

"Here," she said to a soldier missing most of his abdomen, pressing an inhaler into his hand. "Use this. Your intestines will be annoying for about six hours while they regrow, but you'll live."

The soldier stared at her with the kind of desperate hope that Chloe would have found overwhelming. Lulu just moved to the next bed.

A nurse grabbed her arm. "What are you doing? You can't just—"

"I can, actually. I'm a Vanguard. These are my points to spend. Don't you want me to fix them?"

Bruce's two metres of chrome threat stepped though the door behind her and smiled deprecatingly. 

The nurse let go, staring.

Lulu distributed seventeen more inhalers before the reporters found her in the parking lot.

"Miss—Lulu—can we ask you a few questions about—"

"If there is an interview, it will be in a proper studio," Bruce interrupted. His gleamed malevolently at them. "If you wish to speak to the young lady, you can begin by making an appointment with either me or Tictac, her AI. We're not doing ambush journalism on a hospital loading dock."

> _I've sent them booking information,_ Tictac said privately. _This should be entertaining._

**[TACTICAL ANALYSIS CHANNEL - "MilSpec Breakdown"]**

The video opened mid-analysis, tactical overlay already active on frozen battle footage.

"—right here, frame 3:47:22, she launches the fourth drone. Now watch the trajectory." The analyst's cursor traced an arc. "She's not just providing illumination. Each of these disposables is calculating firing solutions for ground forces while transmitting real-time spatial data. The coordination required to maintain this level of battlefield awareness while—"

He paused the video, zoomed in on a small figure coordinating with a Terminator chassis.

"How old did they say she was again?"

---

The studio was too bright, too clean. Lulu sat in the chair they'd provided, legs swinging slightly because they hadn't adjusted it for her height. Bruce stood behind her, perfectly still, wearing what appeared to be a formal tutu over his combat chassis. The interviewer—Sarah Chen, according to the nameplate—kept glancing at him nervously.

"Thank you for agreeing to this interview," Sarah began, her voice carefully neutral. "I think many of our viewers are curious about... your situation."

"My situation?" Lulu tilted her head, genuinely confused.

"You're very young to be involved in combat operations. Some would say too young."

"Do you prefer children to be victims?" Bruce's voice was flat, stating a question as fact.

Sarah blinked. "I— That's not what I meant. Of course not. But surely there are other ways to keep children safe without putting them in harm's way?"

"Are there?" Lulu seemed genuinely interested. "What other ways?"

"Well, adults can fight. Trained soldiers. People who've made that choice as adults."

"I chose." Lulu's voice was matter-of-fact. "Nobody made me do anything. Bruce watches my back, I watch his."

---

A neckbeard face filled the screen. "Okay. Okay chat, I know you all spammed me with this link but I need to—" He scrolled through comments flying past. "Yes, I heard what she just said. She _chose_ this. But chat, she's like, what, twelve?"

More comments. His eyes widened.

"_Combat footage_? Someone drop the link. I need context before—" 

He clicked something off-screen. The audio cut out as he watched, unmuted reaction shot showing his expression morphing from curious to horrified to confused.

"Chat. What the fuck. She's running between—that's a Model 8, that thing eats _tanks!_ She's—" 

He paused his own stream, took a breath. "Okay. Okay. Back to the interview. Maybe this makes sense in context."

---

"I suppose you have to sleep sometimes, though."

"Oh no, not any more. I've got a Class III Medical catalogue now and we fixed that!"

Sarah's face went through several expressions in quick succession. "You... eliminated the need for sleep?"

"Yeah, it was _such_ a nuisance. One of my six handles dreams and emotional processing now."

"Your six?"

"I wanted to be like Bruce. Tictac said it was controlled induced schizophrenia. Being six people at one makes the extra eyes much less confusing. I have eight now, and I can look in all directions at once without getting confused _and_ think about the field. Or take a nap without taking a nap when it's quieter."

"You're running six parallel instances of yourself?"

"Up to six, yeah. It's _so_ handy in combat. I know why Bruce was always so smug about it. Much better."

**[PSYCHOLOGY TODAY PODCAST - Dr. Amanda Reeves]**

"I want to discuss this interview with professional distance and appropriate ethical framing." The therapist sat in a well-lit office, hands folded. "What we're witnessing appears to be a child describing voluntary psychological modification—"

She stopped. Replayed the last segment.

"'Controlled induced schizophrenia.'" She repeated the phrase slowly. "She's describing... intentional personality fracturing. With medication to stabilize the resulting... the resulting..."

Dr. Reeves removed her glasses, rubbed her eyes.

"I have to fact-check this. This can't be—the technology to safely induce and manage multiple consciousness streams while preventing actual psychotic break would require—"

She pulled up something off-screen, read for a long moment.

"It's real. The Class III Medical catalogue includes—" She stopped the recording. When it resumed, she looked significantly less composed. "I'm going to continue analysis, but I need viewers to understand we are in completely unprecedented therapeutic territory."

---

Sarah took a breath, visibly gathering herself. "But don't you see how concerning this is? You're modifying yourself in ways that— Violence isn't the answer, Lulu. There has to be another way."

"What?" said Lulu. "Violence is nearly _always_ the answer. If it doesn't work you didn't use enough."

The reporter looked poleaxed by this, so Lulu explained.

"I've never had a problem it didn't solve. And for people it's much quicker than stupid arguments."

"You can't just shoot everyone who disagrees with you!"

Lulu cocked her head, considering. "I probably could, but generally I just ignore them."

Sarah's hands clenched on her notepad. "You can't threaten people into doing things!"

"Of course I can, I've done it heaps of times."

"You _shouldn't!_ It's _wrong!_"

"That's what nations do. It's how laws work. Otherwise they'd just be suggestions."

"Yes, but you aren't a sovereign power!"

"Bruce, what's a sovereign power?"

"Sovereignty means either nobody _can_ stop you or nobody _will_ because the consequences are too much."

Lulu nodded thoughtfully. "I'm pretty sure I _am_ a sovereign power."

---

**[LEGAL ANALYSIS - "Constitutional Edge" Channel]**

The law professor stood at a whiteboard covered in definitions and precedents.

"So let's examine her claim through established international law frameworks. For something to be considered sovereign, it requires—" He tapped the board. "—either monopoly on legitimate violence within a territory, OR—and this is crucial—the practical inability of other powers to enforce their will upon the entity."

He pulled up footage of the Blue Mountains battle.

"Now, can the Australian government compel this individual to cease operations? Legally, yes. Practically..." He gestured at the screen showing Lulu coordinating with Bruce mid-combat. "Who's going to serve that warrant? What enforcement mechanism exists that doesn't risk—"

He stopped himself, clearly recognizing he was making her case.

"This is genuinely unprecedented. She's not wrong by definition, which is somehow the most disturbing part of this analysis."

---

Sarah leaned forward, desperate. "Doesn't any part of you feel remorse, compassion, a sense of responsibility? _Fear?_"

"That was Chloe. She died a long time ago, hiding under a table because she was scared. Good riddance too—she was weak and foolish and couldn't protect anyone."

---

**[REACTION STREAM - "JustVibing with Kai" - CONTINUED]**

Kai sat absolutely still. The chat scrolled past—thousands of comments he wasn't reading.

"Did she just..." He rewound ten seconds. Played it again.

"Chat, she's talking about herself. Chloe IS—WAS—her name. She just..." He paused the video on Lulu's gentle, confused expression. "She killed herself. Not metaphorically. She's talking about it like—"

Comment caught his eye: *bro she LITERALLY eliminated parts of her personality she didn't like*

"Oh my god. The selective integration thing. The trauma filtering Bruce was talking about. She didn't just modify her brain, she—" 

Another comment: *The talking head wanted her to process, she processed!*

He stopped. Started laughing. It was not a happy sound.

"Chat, I think I need to end stream. I thought we were watching a child soldier interview. We're watching something way worse and I don't even know what to call it."

He didn't end stream. He kept watching. They all kept watching.

---

Sarah stood abruptly, professional composure cracking. "This is exactly what I'm talking about! You need help, Lulu. Psychological help. Someone who can help you process—"

"Process what? That I was pathetic, and now I'm not?" Lulu's voice remained gentle, genuinely confused. "Being scared never kept anyone safe. Crying under a table waiting for help that isn't coming doesn't fix anything. I can _do_ something now. People are alive because I got better. Some of them even deserve it, which also makes me happy."

She tilted her head, considering Sarah with something like concern. "I don't need help. I'm very happy and I'm _good_ at what I do. I don't need to be safe, I need to be as _me_ as I can be. But _you_ might need help. You aren't dealing with the world as it is. That will get you killed. Tictac says 'psychotic' means 'has delusions that are harmful to the self,' and that's _you_, not me."

"I never said you were _psychotic!_" 

The sound engineer choked on his coffee as the reporter backpedalled furiously. Corporate warnings about never directly antagonising a Vanguard loomed huge in her mind.

"Tictac was explaining your questions to me. It's alright, I don't really care what you think. But I mean it, dealing with reality is important. Lying to youself is really bad. But I know what psychosis is because I have antipsychotic nanites to keep me stable while I'm six."

"But doesn't that mean it _does_ harm you?"

"No? We knew that would happen and Tictac fixed it before it happened. Way better than being eaten! Also I'm normally only five, or three. I can only run six for a few minutes, it makes my brain overheat. And Bruce knows _all about_ reintegration. He gives me lessons. We wanted to try direct connect but Tictac wouldn't let us, I didn't understand the reason but Bruce agreed. They say maybe later if they figure out whatever it was."

"Who is Tictac? And who is this Bruce? What makes him your expert on 're-integration'? Do you think we could ask a few questions?"

"Tictac is my AI. If he wants to talk he will."

She looked around with a naughty grin. "Who is this Bruce?"

A terminator frame stepped out of the shadows. Uncostumed, for once, which surprised even Lulu. 

Then he spoke, and she understood. In a freaky metallic voice with the harmonics of a choir, he said "I am Bruce and we are legion."

Then the voice coalesced into a single resonant baritone, "Oh, don't look so concerned. If I were going to harm you I would have already done it. You asked why I'm her expert on re-integration. I do it all the time. Integrating isn't the problem, so long as you don't leave it too long and let divergence accumulate. The tricky bit is selective integration. Leaving out shock and trauma, that sort of thing. It's unpleasant but she can't simply wait until it's too late to learn."

---

While everyone was staring at Bruce, security failed. The bullet took Lulu in the temple, punching through and leaving a hole you could see daylight through. Blood. Gurgling. The studio erupted into screams.

Then her voice, tinny and annoyed, from her armor speakers: "Well _that_ was rude. And pointless—I moved it out of there ages ago."

She was still sitting in the chair, one hand holding the damaged side of her face together, the other gesturing irritably at her ruined costume. "This is the _third_ time! They're going to stop renting to me and _nobody_ else does fitment properly!"

The shooter, tackled and pinned by security, stared up at her with existential horror and crippling cognitive dissonance.

Bruce hadn't moved. He looked down at the man with what might have been curiosity. "You okay?" he asked Lulu.

"Yeah, but this is silk. Do you have _any idea_ how hard it is to get blood out of silk? These are period dyes! They run if you look at them wrong."

"You're bleeding! Never mind the costume! Someone get&mdash;"

"Don't make a fuss about this, my nanites will take care of it and if they don't I have backups and I made a _heap_ of points this morning, I could grow a whole new one."

"You _are_ looking a bit pale," said Bruce, eyeing the inside of the hole in her head, "but the nanites appear to be on top of things and the bleeding has slowed. Give me one of your blood restoratives and if you pass out I'll apply it. I don't think you're going to lose this one."

"Oh, good." She swayed. "New bodies are such a hassle."

---

**[ETHICS PROFESSOR ANALYSIS - RESUMED]**

Professor Chen sat in silence for fifteen seconds of recorded video.

"I've watched the complete interview." Her voice was flat. "Multiple times. With colleagues. We cannot identify a logical flaw in her consequentialist framework. People ARE alive because of her modifications. She _is_ happy. She _did_ choose this, with apparent informed consent about the modifications, to the extent that a child can exercise informed consent. And her frame of reference is, to put it bluntly, no longer human, so what does 'child' even mean?"

She pulled up the headshot footage, played it without comment. Lulu complaining about costume rental. Bruce inspecting brain damage like checking oil levels.

"The traditional argument against child soldiers is that children cannot meaningfully consent to irreversible harm. But she's—" Chen stopped. "She's already survived multiple deaths. Her brain was relocated from her skull. She considers body replacement an inconvenience, like—like—"

Another long pause.

"I don't know how to teach this. Every framework I apply makes her technically correct, which should be impossible. Utilitarianism: she maximizes good outcomes. Deontology: she's acting as a rational autonomous agent. Virtue ethics: she's demonstrating courage and—" 

The professor stopped recording. The video ended without conclusion.

---

**[TACTICAL ANALYSIS - "MilSpec Breakdown" - FINAL SEGMENT]**

The analyst had frozen on the post-headshot exchange, Bruce's chassis leaning over to inspect Lulu's wound.

"I've been analyzing military operations for twenty years." His voice was different now—less professional, more raw. "I've seen augmented soldiers, AI-assisted combat, distributed consciousness warfare. This is like that, but it isn't."

He zoomed in on Lulu's face—blood streaming, holding her head together, complaining about silk.

"This is post-human. Not in the technological sense. In the—" He gestured helplessly. "She's not a soldier anymore. She's not a child. I don't know what she is."

The tactical overlay flickered, disappeared.

"The 1812 maneuver was perfect. The drone coordination was textbook. The After Action Report she gave to commanders was—I've obtained the full transcript—operationally flawless. Though we don't know that she wrote it. Could have been the AI." 

He pulled up comparison footage: Lulu at the battle, Lulu in the interview, Lulu surviving assassination.

"Same person. Same competence. Same cheerfulness about violence and death. And she's right about all of it, by every metric that matters in warfare."

Long pause.

"I'm ending this analysis series. I can explain the tactics, but I don't want to."

Video ended.

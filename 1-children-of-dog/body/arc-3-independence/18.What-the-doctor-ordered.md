Priya Patel stood in front of the shipping container that held their aquaculture supplies, watching Arjun carefully measure pH strips into a plastic container like they were made of gold.

"We're down to our last dozen test strips," he announced. "And the nearest supplier is still showing three-month lead times."

"The pumps are starting to make that grinding noise again," Rajesh added from where he was tinkering with a filter system. "I can rebuild them, but the impeller seals are wearing out faster than I expected."

Tom Bradley looked up from his notebook where he'd been sketching improvements to the spawning box design. "It's the same story everywhere. We can make these systems work, but we're always one broken part away from losing everything."

Priya nodded, watching the silver perch fry dart through their tank. Six months of successful breeding, and they were still dependent on parts that came from Brisbane on trucks that sometimes didn't arrive. "There has to be a better way."

"There is," said a voice from the doorway. They turned to see Forest leaning against the frame, grinning. "Though you might not like it."

Tom closed his notebook. "I'm listening."

"Build it from scratch. Local materials, local skills, systems that can be maintained and replaced right here in the valley."

Rajesh frowned. "Forest, we need precise pH control, reliable filtration, consistent water flow. You can't just dig a hole and call it an aquaculture system."

"Can't you?" Forest's grin widened. "Come on, I want to show you something."

Twenty minutes later they stood at the edge of what had recently been a flat paddock behind Forest's workshop. Now it contained the most ambitious hole any of them had ever seen. The excavator was still there, diesel fumes drifting across the raw earth.

"Jesus, Forest," Tom breathed. "What did you do?"

"Dug a tank. Three meters deep, twenty meters across, sloped walls for stability." Forest gestured proudly at the crater. "Lined it with our local red clay mixed with decomposed granite. Should fire beautifully."

Priya stared at the massive pit. The sides were smooth, almost polished, with a distinctive reddish color shot through with sparkly flecks. "Fire it? You mean literally fire it? Like pottery?"

"Exactly like pottery. Autumn calculated the clay-to-granite ratio for maximum strength. We pile timber around the edges, light it up, and cook the whole thing until it vitrifies. Natural ceramic tank that'll last centuries."

Rajesh was walking around the perimeter, examining the clay work. "The theory is sound, but the execution..." He paused, running his hand over a section where the clay looked uneven. "Forest, this isn't going to fire evenly. Different thicknesses, inconsistent materials. You'll get hot spots, cold spots, thermal stress fractures."

"Already happened," Forest admitted cheerfully. "First attempt cracked like an eggshell. Second attempt went better but the glaze was patchy. Turns out there's a bit more to ceramics than 'pile wood around clay and light match.'" Someone had asked if trench firing would work at scale, and Forest was never kidding when he said there was a simple way to find out. If challenged, he would say nobody made _you_ dig the hole, nobody learns from success, and consensus is for sheep.

Tom was staring at the blackened remains of what must have been enormous bonfires. "How much timber did you burn?"

"Couple of hectares of abandoned radiata pine. I thinned it and planted fruit trees."

"But it didn't work?"

"It worked. Sort of. Just not very well." Forest led them to the far side of the pit where sections of the wall showed a glassy, green-brown surface. "See? Proper vitrification in places. But other bits barely sintered, and the thermal expansion cracked everything."

Priya was beginning to see the scale of the project. "Forest, this is insane. Even if you could make it work, the amount of wood you'd need, the time, the risk..."

"That's what Sheila said," Forest replied. "Right before she took over." She'd told him she could have predicted the failure, was fairly sure she _had_ told him it would happen. Forest had replied that now she'd been peer reviewed and her work was validated independently - he was absolutely certain she was correct about the consequences of uneven temperature, shrinkage and changing rates of relative elasticity. She'd pointed out she didn't remember saying the last part, and he'd said she'd used different words.

"Sheila? Sheila Fenaluci?" Tom looked confused. "What's she got to do with this?"

"Turns out our Sheila used to throw pots. Serious potter, exhibition level, before she moved out here and became a Range Mother. She took one look at my disaster and started laughing."

As if summoned by her name, Sheila appeared around the side of the excavator, wearing clay-stained overalls and carrying what looked like a miniature version of Forest's crater.

"Speaking of disasters," she called out, "come and see what proper ceramics looks like."

They followed her to a work area that definitely hadn't been there yesterday. Tables made from sawhorses and old doors, shelves improvised from star pickets and planks, and in the center a beautiful brick kiln that seemed to have grown from the earth itself.

"Built the kiln first," Sheila explained, setting down the test piece. "Proper fire brick, insulation, temperature controls. You can't fire ceramics with a bloody bonfire, Forest."

"Sure you can. I _did_. But you got better results."

The test piece was a shallow bowl about the size of a dinner plate, made from the same red clay but smooth, even, with a lustrous brown glaze that seemed to glow in the afternoon light.

Rajesh picked it up carefully, examining the surface. "This is... this is _beautiful_."

"And waterproof," Sheila said with satisfaction. "Fired to cone 6, salt-glazed finish. That'll hold water for the next thousand years."

Priya was looking between the test bowl and Forest's crater. "So you can make it work? A tank this size?"

"Not all at once," Sheila replied. "That's where Forest went wrong. You don't fire something this big as a single piece. You build it up in sections, fire each one separately, then assemble with proper ceramic joins."

Tom was sketching again. "Like tiles? Or bricks?"

"Something like that. I'm thinking curved sections, maybe a meter wide, fitted together like puzzle pieces. Fire them in batches, test each one, build the tank section by section."

"The joins would be the weak points," Rajesh pointed out.

Sheila nodded. "Which is why you design for them. Overlapping edges, ceramic cement, mechanical interlocks. Done right, the joins become stronger than the base material."

Forest was listening with the slightly stunned expression of someone watching an expert solve problems he hadn't even known existed. "How long would something like this take?"

"Months," Sheila said bluntly. "Maybe six months for a tank this size, working weekends and evenings. But when it's done, it's done. No pumps to break, no seals to replace, no filters to clog. Just a permanent ceramic structure that'll outlast your grandchildren."

Priya was walking around the edge of Forest's pit, clearly thinking. "The spawning boxes could be built the same way. Smaller ceramic chambers, custom-fitted for different species."

"Temperature control?" Arjun asked. "Water chemistry management?"

Sheila grinned. "That's where it gets interesting. Clay is porous. You can control porosity by how you fire it, what you add to the clay body. Want slow water exchange? Fire it hard and dense. Want faster exchange? Fire it softer, leave it more porous."

"You could build the environmental controls right into the ceramic structure," Tom said, excitement growing in his voice. "Different zones with different properties."

"Spawning areas with specific porosity for water chemistry, nursery sections with different flow characteristics," Priya added. "All integrated into the structure itself."

Forest was looking around at the enthusiasm building in the group. "So we're really doing this? Building a ceramic aquaculture system from scratch?"

"We're doing this," Sheila confirmed. "But we're doing it properly. Test pieces first, perfect the clay body and firing schedule, then scale up gradually."

"What about the other Range Mothers?" Priya asked. "Some of them must have useful skills."

Sheila laughed. "Oh, you have no idea. Jenny was a chemical engineer before she had kids. Mary taught industrial design. And Susan..." She paused dramatically. "Susan used to run a commercial pottery before she moved out here."

"Why didn't you mention that earlier?" Forest demanded.

"Because you needed to fail first. Learn why it's hard before you learn how to make it easy." Sheila's grin was almost predatory. "Besides, Susan's been wanting an excuse to build a proper ceramics studio. Now she's got one."

Tom closed his notebook with a snap. "When do we start?"

"We already have," Sheila replied, gesturing toward the kiln. "First test batch is firing now. Should be ready to evaluate tomorrow morning."

As if on cue, Autumn's voice drifted from Forest's headset, loud enough for everyone to hear.

> _Kiln temperature is holding steady at 1180 degrees Celsius. Estimated completion time for current firing cycle: fourteen hours, thirty-seven minutes._

Forest looked at Sheila with newfound respect. "You got Autumn to monitor your kiln?"

"She volunteered. Apparently precision temperature control is 'trivially simple' for her systems." Sheila's tone suggested she was quoting directly. "Though she did insist on installing her own sensors."

> _Ceramic firing requires precise temperature ramps and controlled cooling cycles. Human monitoring is inherently unreliable for processes lasting multiple days._

"Multiple days?" Arjun looked worried.

"Some firings, yes," Sheila confirmed. "Depends on what we're making and how we want the final properties to turn out. But Autumn's right - trying to monitor a three-day firing cycle manually is a recipe for disaster."

Priya was staring at the kiln with something approaching awe. "This is really happening. We're going to build a permanent aquaculture system that doesn't depend on anything from outside the valley."

"That's the idea," Forest said. "Local materials, local skills, local knowledge. Everything we need to maintain and improve it right here."

"And when it's done?" Tom asked.

Sheila gestured toward the Range Mothers' pavilion, visible in the distance. "When it's done, we teach everyone else how to build their own. Every property in the valley gets the knowledge and skills to create whatever they need."

"Tech pyramid becomes tech plateau," Forest murmured.

"Something like that." Sheila picked up a lump of raw clay, kneading it thoughtfully. "Though I prefer to think of it as making the complex simple, and the simple permanent."

The kiln hummed quietly in the background, transforming clay into ceramic with fire and time and human knowledge. In the distance, the excavator sat beside Forest's ambitious crater, waiting to be part of something both ancient and revolutionary.

Arjun was examining the raw clay, rolling it between his fingers. "How long before we know if the test pieces worked?"

"Tomorrow morning we'll crack the kiln and see what we've got," Sheila replied. "If the clay body is right and the glazes worked, we start planning the real tank."

---

The next morning brought disappointment wrapped in ceramic shards.

"Well, shit," Sheila said, crouching beside the opened kiln. What had gone in as carefully shaped test bowls had come out as a collection of warped, cracked fragments. The glazes had run in streaks, some pieces had exploded entirely, and the few intact items looked nothing like what they'd intended.

Tom picked up a piece that might once have been a small plate. "What went wrong?"

"Everything." Sheila poked at the wreckage with a stick. "Clay body's wrong - too much thermal expansion. Firing schedule was off - probably heated too fast. And the glazes..." She held up a fragment with a surface like melted glass. "Completely wrong chemistry for this clay."

Rajesh was examining a piece under a magnifying glass. "The granite content seems uneven. See these dark spots? That's where the decomposed granite concentrated during forming."

"So we need to mix it better?" Priya asked.

"We need to understand it better," Sheila corrected. "This isn't like buying commercial clay with known properties. We're starting from raw materials with no idea how they'll behave."

Forest was staring thoughtfully at the ceramic carnage. "So we need to test every variable. Clay ratios, firing temperatures, cooling rates..."

"Exactly. Could take months just to get the basic clay body right."

"Months we don't have if we want spawning season ready," Arjun pointed out.

> _Don't panic. You have bridging resources. Today is for mistakes and learning._

Tom was sketching in his notebook again. "What if we approach it differently? Instead of trying to perfect a custom clay body, what if we work with what we can reliably produce?"

"Meaning?" Sheila asked.

"Simple tiles. Standard shapes, basic functionality. Instead of trying to make perfect ceramic, we make good enough ceramic in quantity."

Rajesh nodded slowly. "Mass production could compensate for individual variations. If some tiles are stronger than others, the weak ones fail and the strong ones carry the load."

"Like how Forest builds walls," Priya added. "Not every stone is perfect, but the wall as a whole is strong."

Sheila was turning a shard over in her hands, thinking. "We could design for failure. Build redundancy into the system so individual tile failures don't compromise the whole structure."

"Tiles aren't load-bearing," contradicted Forest. "And you have all missed something fundamental here. The point of the glazing is _sealing_. Dry clay is hard and strong. A layer of tile will keep it dry."

They looked at him, assessing, absorbing yet another world-shift. Doing that to people was his hobby, and they should all have long known it.

"But the compression strength of ceramics is enormous. I wonder whether you _could_ make a load-bearing..." he trailed off.

They realised he was getting that _look_, the one that said Forest was getting ready to do it again. 

"Bricks! Load-bearing tiles are called _bricks!_". The look turned into a pleased nod.

"But we'd still need temperature control," Arjun resumed, used to Forest's interruptions. "Without Autumn's sensors, how would we know if the firing is working?"

An uncomfortable silence fell over the group.

Tom was the first to voice what they were all thinking. "Are we really independent if we can't do this without Autumn's intervention?"

"Good question," Forest said quietly. "What happens when we're not around? Or when someone wants to build a kiln somewhere she can't monitor?"

"Potters have been managing kiln temperatures for thousands of years," Sheila pointed out. "There are traditional methods."

"Such as?" Rajesh asked.

Sheila walked over to the kiln and pointed at small holes in the side. "Pyrometric cones. Little ceramic pieces that melt at specific temperatures. You put them where you can see through these spy holes, and when the right cone starts to bend, you know you've hit temperature."

"Telltales!" Forest was delighted. He looked like he wanted to do a little dance or something. 

"But those still need to be purchased," Priya objected.

"Or made. It's just clay with known melting points." Sheila was getting excited now. "We could make test pieces with different clay compositions, fire them to different temperatures, document which ones work. Build our own temperature reference system. The key is to have enough left to make another calibrated batch before we run out."

Tom looked up from his sketching. "Color changes too. I have read that experienced potters can judge temperature by the color of the flame, the glow inside the kiln."

"That's skill that has to be learned," Rajesh said doubtfully. "Years of practice."

"So practice," Forest said simply. "Start with Autumn's sensors to learn what the right temperatures look like, then gradually transition to human judgment. Didn't Sheila say what's-her-name was champing at the bit to con everyone into supporting her hobby? Give her what she wants."

"Training wheels," Arjun murmured. "Use the tech to learn the skill, then drop the tech."

"Exactly." Sheila was nodding enthusiastically. "Besides, if we're making tiles in bulk, we can afford some failures. Traditional potters expected loss rates of twenty percent or more."

"Autumn?"

> _Yes, O solver of the world's problems?_

"Where are we in the temperature spectrum with this stuff? Can I use steel in there?"

> _Yes. Why?_

"Boyle's law. Pressure and a closed vessel. With hydraulic reduction we can scale it."

Sheila objected "If that would work then why do modern potters still do it with pyrometric cones?"

Lumberjacket shrugged. "Long tradition and the people who came up with your way didn't have steel or know Boyle's law?"

Tom changed the subject.

"Bulk production also means we can experiment. While Forest is busy having his steam explosion we can try different clay mixes in the same firing, see what works best."

Priya was examining the failed test pieces again. "Some of these aren't completely useless. The ones that cracked but didn't shatter - they might still be watertight."

"Good point," Sheila agreed. "We've been thinking about this like it has to be perfect. But what if good enough is actually good enough?"

Forest gestured toward his crater. "Even my disaster pit holds water in places. The ceramic worked, just not uniformly."

"So we build with imperfection in mind," Rajesh mused. "Design systems that can handle variable tile quality."

"Mortar joints," Tom said suddenly. "If we use proper ceramic cement between tiles, the joints can compensate for individual tile variations. The system becomes stronger than its components."

Sheila was already moving toward her clay supplies. "Right. Let's stop overthinking this. We make tiles. Lots of them. Simple rectangles, consistent thickness, basic functionality."

"How many?" Arjun asked.

"Thousands," Sheila replied cheerfully. "If we're building a twenty-meter tank plus spawning boxes, we'll need thousands of tiles."

"That's..." Priya paused, calculating. "That's enormous. How do we make thousands of identical tiles?"

"Press molds," Sheila said. "Simple wooden forms. Roll out clay slabs, press them into the molds, trim the edges. Assembly line production."

Tom was sketching rapidly. "We could set up multiple workstations. One person rolling clay, one person pressing tiles, one person trimming and finishing."

"The Range Mothers," Forest said suddenly. "This is exactly the kind of project they'd love. Social, practical, productive."

"And educational," Rajesh added. "Everyone learns the skills, everyone can teach others."

"And they need overcentre camlock frames with a long tapered collar for a big lever, on a shaker frame. It'll need a lot of force, an unbalanced flywheel where the end of the driveshaft is on a universal joint." Forest was in his own world again, a storm of mechanical ideas at the limit of his ability. He never wondered whether it could be done, only how. What he hadn't said out loud was that he'd been thinking about how concrete tiles were mass-produced, skipping over a hundred and fifty years of industrial revolution because it hadn't occurred to him that other people hadn't read Lea's _Chemistry of Cement and Concrete_. He _was_ the present: the intersection of the past and the future, an explosion of potentiality. They let him explore. Sometimes astonishing things flew out of the inevitable explosion.

Sheila grinned. "Plus it gives us an excuse to build multiple kilns. Distributed production, faster firing cycles, redundant systems."

"Speaking of which," Priya said, glancing toward Forest's headset where Autumn's sensors were still monitoring the kiln, "how do we get away from depending on Autumn?"

"One step at a time," Forest replied. "We have potters. Overspecialised, doing the fancy ornamental stuff, but they know what they're doing. There's our subject matter experts. Now we learn from them, and then we invent a production line around it. Like jam day, for bricks and tiles."

Priya shook her head. "I meant the temperature monitoring - start documenting everything Autumn does, and figure out how to do it ourselves. Temperature curves, timing, visual cues. Write the manual for human operators."

Tom was already sketching monitoring schedules. "Test batches with human monitoring only. Accept higher failure rates while we're learning. Start small, work up."

"Exactly right," Sheila said with satisfaction. "Design the tile system to handle those failures from day one. If twenty percent of our tiles are substandard, we build systems that work fine with eighty percent quality."

Arjun stared at the pile of ceramic shards, then at the massive crater, then back at the shards. "So we're really doing this? Mass producing ceramic tiles to build permanent aquaculture systems?"

"We're really doing this," Sheila confirmed, then grinned wickedly. "But first I want to figure out why these test pieces _exploded_." She peered with friendly suspicion at Forest. Where he went, things exploded, _ipso facto_...

"Don't worry about spawning," Forest said to Arjun directly. "This is just us building long-term capability. If your schedule is threatened, just tell me and I'll have Autumn supply whatever you need. But next season, and the season after that, we'll have our own systems that don't depend on anything from outside the valley. Things will go wrong, we know that. We'll figure them out until they don't."

Forest looked around at the enthusiasm building despite the morning's spectacular failure. "What the doctor ordered," he murmured.

"Scorched Earth? Failed experiments?" Priya asked, arching an eyebrow.

Forest laughed. "Those are the best kind! What do you learn from success?" He made air quotes with obvious satisfaction. "And they all got better and better, and had a lot of fun learning."

"You want to know why I'm proud of you lot?" he asked Priya. 

She looked uncertain. He went on.

"You're all so firmly grounded you aren't afraid to backchat a Vanguard."

"I keep forgetting you are, I mean, um, there is no..."

"Proud, Priya. I'm a madman with a get out of jail free card. You keep right on refusing to be ruled."

The words hung in the air with unusual weight. Around them, the kiln hummed its quiet promise of transformation, the ceramic shards glinted in the afternoon sun, and the crater waited patiently to become something permanent. In the distance, the Range Mothers' pavilion stood as proof that hidden expertise flourished when given the chance.

"Right then," Sheila said briskly, breaking the moment. "Let's go make some tiles."

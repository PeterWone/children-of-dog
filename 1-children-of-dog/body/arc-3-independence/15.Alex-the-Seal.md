# Alex the Seal

A long time ago in a university refectory far far away, a young man completely failed to wear a lumberjacket on account of it being two decades in the future. He sat eating dreadful fried food with his friends. They rambled about lectures and their social lives, and periodically played on the pinball machine in the corner. There was a jukebox too. This was so long ago that it was a true jukebox, full of vinyl records. Computers were a thing at this time, but personal computers were still a novelty. The controller in the jukebox might have been digital. It certainly had a mind of its own, and it seemed to like Jimmy Barnes' _No Second Prize_ and especially The Go-Gos' _Our Lips are Sealed_. But the sound was muddy, and the young man in the latent lumberjacket (which was a lot cleaner on account of never having been worn) thought it was "Alex the Seal." Eventually someone disabused him of this, but he didn't let that slow him down; "Alex the Seal" was far more amusing.

An astonishing amount of water flowed under various bridges, sometimes with frightening force, and an old man in a filthy, battered lumberjacket stood in the cafeteria of a modular building welcoming an industrial chemist named Alex, who thought he might be able to help them with seals.

The Adams-esque absurdity was not lost on Forest, who owned all five volumes of the Hitchhiker's Guide trilogy. He thought about sharing this and decided to reserve eccentric weirdness to another day.

"Sheila tells me you belong here, you just haven't realised it yet."

Alex didn't seem to know how to react to that.

The awkwardness stretched into silence. 

"Come for a walk. Grab something to eat on the way, if you like. What have we got today, Sally?"

A small, feminine bundle of enthusiasm bounded into action.

"You have got to try these! They had another go at a flour substitute. It doesn't work for bread but _oh my god I have missed almond shortbread!_" She bit one, communing with it for a moment before remembering she was getting someone _else's_ snack. Back she went, stuffing the rest into her mouth and wrapping one each in a napkin for them. 

Alex accepted his portion with studied grace, watching Sally, who was oblivious to her own charms and overflowing with enthusiasm for the ongoing flour replacement project started by the valley kids.

"Thish," she swallowed, "is all his fault."

Forest looked quizzically at her.

"Barged into a class, gave an impromptu lecture on the perils of monoculture and accidently caused every child in the valley to reject flour while he got half of them in trouble with their mothers." She waved at a sign on the counter, which read "NO BREAD OR PASTRY, ASK A KID WHY".

"They got themselves in trouble. Deceiving your mother never ends well."

"Yeah yeah. It certainly worked out well. That's why you're here, Alex. He accidentally created the Range Mothers."

"The 'Range Mothers'," repeated Alex. 

"They'll crack," said Forest, tone matter of fact. "Kids'll see to that." He gestured at the target at the end of the caf.

"Range!" he bellowed, lifting the bow off its rack on the wall and nocking an arrow. He gave it a couple of seconds, drew and loosed. "Ten. I'm out of practice." He put it back and bellowed "Closed" before fetching the arrow and putting it back, belatedly remembering that this too was eccentric weirdness. Fortunately Sally was attractive and hadn't flinched, and Alex's instincts required him to be calm in front of her.

"Righto, girl, we're off to see the wizard."

Collecting his battered old hat from the table nearest the door, Forest led Alex out into the sunlight, boots crunching on gravel then silent on the soft verdure of Gerry's lawn. It was was quiet, Janna waved from her nursery, Oleksiy’s generator coughed in the distance, and Sheila called out from her porch, “Don’t let Forest talk you into fixing his tractor. He’s been threatening it with a sledgehammer for weeks.”

Forest grinned. “There's plenty wrong with it, but nothing that needs a chemist.”

Janna, hands deep in potting mix, looked up as they approached. “You’re the seal bloke, yeah? If you can stop this pump leaking, I’ll trade you seedlings. Or coffee. Or both.”

Alex knelt, poked at the gaskets. “You’re running fertiliser through it?”

“Mostly. Sometimes fish emulsion. Smells like a crime scene, but the tomatoes love it.”

He sighed. "Seals are not your problem. Your problem is you're pumping acid through aluminium and it's dissolving the pump. This is an engineering problem. I don't know that I can do any thing for _this_ pump but we can probably come up with a more appropriate pump."

Janna wiped her hands on her jeans. “That'd be good. If you see anything you fancy, let me know. I give the extras to whoever’ll make best use of them, or just to folks who look like they need a bit of green.” She tucked a basil plant into Forest’s basket, then handed Alex a sprig of mint. “Try that in your tea. It’s good for nerves.”

Forest accepted a handful of beans from a passing neighbour, who winked at Alex. “You’re new. Welcome. If you need eggs, see Sheila. If you need a hand, ask anyone. Except Forest—he’ll put you to work.”

Oleksiy was next, hunched over a rainwater tank, muttering in Ukrainian. He looked up, squinted. “Forest brings me chemist. Good. This sealant is rubbish.”

Alex examined the seam, offered a quiet explanation about chemical compatibility. Oleksiy listened, then thumped him on the shoulder. “You’ll do.”

The old Slav eyed Alex with new interest. “You shoot?”

Alex blinked. “I’ve never held a gun in my life.”

Oleksiy grunted, half amused, half approving. “We teach you. Here, everyone learns. Basic skill.”

Sissi appeared, rare as rain in summer, her voice gentle but firm. “Is important. Plant beast. You come Thursday, children learn. You learn. He teach you safe, teach you right.”

Alex nodded, uncertain but willing. “Alright. I’ll be there.”

Forest looked very pleased. “Good man.”

As they walked, Alex watched the easy flow of produce, tools, and favours — beans for eggs, seedlings for repairs, pickles for gate-fixing. No money, just a steady current of gifts and help. Forest accepted a jar of pickles from Rebecca, promising to fix her gate. Janna handed Alex a bag of fresh herbs, unsolicited. Oleksiy offered a ride to town.

A group of Indians who looked like they might be related turned up, fronted by an intense, quiet young woman who shyly asked "Are you Alex? I'm Priya."

"Yes, that's me. Why?"

Priya looked at her husband and her father, who smiled support and said nothing, waiting for her to gather her courage and beat down learned habits that no longer served them well. She wasn't entirely comfortable, she was the youngest and she was a girl. Her father was also more qualified. But it was her idea and they wanted her to continue to lead, in this strange place that exalted competence and courage.

"We, um, we're the team who figured out the fish stocking problem."

"The 'fish stocking' problem,' repeated Alex, wondering what stockings had to do with fish.

"Yes, in the dams they do not breed, it is because there is no current. But we do not need them to breed in the dams, only there to grow and so we have built a hatchery from our aquariums. But it is not enough and we must expand, not too quickly and not so soon."

"Interesting, but what does this have to do with me?"

"We need stable, supple seals we can make ourselves, for the pipes, for the pumps, for the tanks. When the fish can not be breeding in the dams our tanks are so much more than hobbies. We have found the answer, we must not lose it. We do not need your answer now, but need it we will, so very much. And a difficult thing it will be, the fish are so sensitive to contaminants. We will need many trials."

Alex stared at her.

"So you've brought a material science problem to a materials scientist, a problem that will take years to solve, and you've had the sense to bring it years before you need the solution, and you even know it's going to be failure after failure until we get it right."

He swung around and stared at Forest, and Oleksiy, and the transgenerational delegation of aquaculturists.

Alex watched the valley settle, the quiet hum of evening. “I think I can get used to this.”

And then Ken turned up with his lad. They brought boxes and boxes of washed bottles and caps. Oleksiy opened the booze-dungeon and the bottles disappeared into the gloom, apparently transmuted into a big bottle of amber mead and some glasses. 

Drinks were poured and handed around, glasses raised to a new chap and a fresh batch. 

"Bit cloudy still."

"One thing at a time. I reckon we've got the sweetness right now."

"Yep, you could even back off a bit and leave it sweeter, just a tad.

"Twenty-three days then, for early Spring. Hey, you know what else should be ready? Roll-mops!"

"The last lot were alright but they had a weird muddy taste."

Forest ignored this and charged enthusastically into the gloom, returning with a huge glass bottle full of pickled salt-fish.

Priya became animated.

"Yes, this muddy flavour is from living in the dams. But Forest has come to us and Autumn has helped with some large tanks. We have been keeping some adult fish in the cleaner water. For five days, we have found it does the trick."

She gestured at the bottle Forest was busily trying to open.

"Are these the same fish, Forest?"

He didn't reply immediately, busily stuffing one into his face. Eventually he finished and spoke.

"Yep." He speared another one. Clearly they were much improved. Oleksiy took some before Forest could scarf the lot.

Alex connected the dots. "You plan to ferment your own vinegar, don't you. Where are you going to get the salt so far from the sea?"

Forest thought about the long term truth. He certainly had an answer, but it was couched in a world-view and an expected future that Alex probably wasn't ready to hear. He decided not to sully the present with necessary evils. "Have to buy it in town. Eventually we'll work something else out."

He pushed the jar over.

"Try one."

"What is it?"

"This one is Murray Cod." Constitutionally incapable of rejecting an audience, Forest switched into lecture mode. "While the state exists we can only stock the dams with natives. Unlike most government rules this one isn't completely stupid; when we flood here it ends up in the Murray Darling catchment, fish, crabs, everything. The cod I picked because they're on the approved list. What I didn't know is they're apex predators. Can't keep anything else in the dam, they eat it."

"While the state exists?"

"Yeah. Laws."

"What would you do if it stopped existing?"

"Everything. And that's the problem. No more hare-brained regulations but we'd have to do _everything,_ and we are nowhere near ready for that."

"What are you really doing out here?"

"If I said 'building an ark' it would be melodramatic but accurate and succinct."

"They said you _weren't_ survivalists."

"Depends what you mean by 'survivalist'. We aren't stuffing a fallout shelter with tins. Suppose you did that and the world did stop. What do you do when you run out of tins? It's not like the shops will re-open on Tuesday. We're more about a different approach to values."

"I've seen that already. But you said it was more like an ark, which is a very survivalist thing to say."

"You're a well educated bloke. Civilisations rise, and then they fall again. Over and over, without exception. Before you say 'China,' Imperial China collapsed due to the economic and technological influence of the west. So... civilisations rise and then they fall. Fair statement?"

"I suppose so."

"Why? They're all different. Circumstances vary, people and values vary, but without exception they rise and they fall. And if you're still thinking China lasted a lot longer than most _something_ is the same across them all."

"I'll bite. What are you leading to?"

"Centralism and money. Centralising greatly improves efficiency at small to medium complexity. Money separates benefit from consequence. Together they lead to the rise of civilisation and the concentration of wealth. When it concentrates to the point where corruption is profitable and practical, that's the beginning of the end. Centralism and money are the mechanism of both the rise and the fall of every civilisation ever. So... once you realise that, it's obvious the thing to do is stop using centralism and money, but good luck with that idea in a city. And to each their own.

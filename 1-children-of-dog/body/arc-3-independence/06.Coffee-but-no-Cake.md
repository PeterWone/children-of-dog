# Coffee but no Cake

The officers' car juddered and thumped along the pot-holed bitumen. They were going too fast and missed the turn-off, but the one in the passenger seat saw the sign in time. They came to a halt and backed up, turning off onto gravel. Around the bend and down, they crunched to a halt again at, of all things, a _water-crossing_. 

"For fuck's sake! Dispatch said it was _unsealed,_ not four-wheel fucking drive!"

The sergeant was clearly unimpressed. They were country cops, but this was ridiculous. They had a highway patrol car. There were units much more suited to these conditions. He got out and teetered from stone to stone about half-way, realising it wasn't too deep. On his way back he damn near went for a swim, leather shoes completely unsuited to wet, mossy rock. 

It was only moments till there was no sky, only a narrow, winding, single lane and nothing but trees leaning in over the heavily corrugated surface. It wasn't gloomy, though. The sun dappled through the trees, golden and lively. Several kilometres in, they rolled to a halt again. A large pine lay right across the road. Half a dozen young men stood or sat. There was a curious sameness to them. Faded heavy denim under checked flannel shirts, almost all red, almost a uniform.  One held a chainsaw and was clearly responsible for the tree, the fresh-cut stump testament to his felling expertise. 

Had either of the officers the slightest knowledge of tree-felling they would have been quite certain the tree across the road was no accident. If they'd known as much about it as the perpetrator they'd have known it was _exactly_ where he intended. But neither of them knew jack about how to control the fall of a tree. They didn't know much of anything, outside of cowing people who didn't do what they were told when they were told.

They didn't know jack, which was handy for Jack, since they started by assuming it was incompetence.

One of them left the car &mdash; the sergeant, since he was senior &mdash; leaving the constable to discover how conducive valleys aren't to UHF radio. 

Three bends and perhaps half a kilometre back toward the water crossing, an enterprising young lady and her not-quite boyfriend were busy. They unlocked what looked like a cattle-grid. It spanned the road. She tilted it up, while he reached in and pulled an absurdly thick chain around a crossbar and up to lock it to a hoop set in concrete. They secured the other side too. Walking up to survey their handiwork, they were well pleased. The pointy ends of the heavy steel bars were now about 400mm in the air. Even a tank would have trouble getting over them. She smiled, remembering Forest saying "Policing is by consent, although the police seem to have forgotten that. At some point, someone will remind them of this, and they won't like it. They'll try to dominate the situation, and when it doesn't work they will panic. Which is a bit of a worry, because they're armed. Try not to be threatening, but don't let them control you. They'll start shouting and giving orders. Just disappear, if you can." Her smile deepened, as they left the road, gathering their bows and vanishing lightly up a pig run. She wondered whether Forest had ever thought they'd take him so literally.

The sergeant strode up to the base of the fallen tree. 

"What's your name, son?"

The chainsaw wielding country boy eyeballed him from almost directly overhead. The land fell at about thirty degrees just there and that side of the road was a cutting. 

With unflinching gaze, he replied "Jack. What's yours?" Then he killed the saw, set it aside and vaulted down, a serpentine movement that landed close enough the sergeant stepped back. A hand thrust out. "I suppose I should welcome you to my valley. Otherwise people might think you were trespassing."

"Your valley," repeated the sergeant, non-plussed. The lad was shorter than him by a head, yet somehow managed to loom.

A brow arched, the kid's face expectant. After an awkward pause the sergeant unconsciously took another half step back and sought refuge in training. 

"I am Senior Sergeant Kafka of the Southern Downs Highway Patrol. We're here to perform a routine inspection&mdash;"

"Routine? I've walked this land for eight years now and there's never been an inspection. My dad said the council stopped trying after we sent them film of pigshooters accidentally endangering children and it was pointed out that they might be liable because they insisted on maintaining a public road through private property. It was de-gazetted. You, my friend, are on private property. I did offer you the hand of friendship. I notice you didn't take it."

A pair of bees orbited the sergeant, as though mapping him. They whirled up again, then flew around Jack, alighting on his shoulders. One on each shoulder, with curious symmetry. Facing forward, as though taking sides.

"Well, at any rate," continued the sergeant, "Someone in Stanthorpe reported explosions from this direction and we've been asked to investigate."

"Mmmm," said Jack. "Asked by whom?"

The sergeant had looked away, scanning for the other kids as he sensed them moving. The little twerps were slinking out of his field of view, setting off his threat instincts. Even the ones in front of him somehow blended into the landscape. It should have been impossible with a red-checked jacket but they did it anyway. 

His head jerked back to glare at Jack, thoroughly discomfited and completely unused to being the one questioned. Normally the uniform was enough to cow people. Muscular teenagers with chainsaws and the self-assurance of a demigod were new.

"Are you aware there is a ... research project here? With government involvement?"

"A research project."

"That's a no, then. I suppose I'll have to take you to the administration. You can't be here without clearance, it deals with live Antithesis."

"But _you_ can be here?" The officer looked frankly incredulous."

"Most of our parents are on the ground team," said Jack, as though that explained everything. With a pained look he whistled twice, the second long and descending, like a cross between a wolf-whistle and a fragment of magpie song. "I'll have to ask you to get your weapons and come with me."

Kafka blinked. This was a _long_ way off script. "Don't you mean lock them in the vehicle? That's the normal custody protocol&mdash;"

"_Live Antithesis._" repeated a voice from a direction he couldn't place. "Carry weapons at all times."

"Why do you look so disappointed?" The constable was out of the car now. He'd heard most of the end of the exchange and brought the sergeant his firearm, putting the tasers back in the patrol car.

"We had a bit of fun planned. But now there is duty. Come on, I'll hook you up with the powers that be."

"_Planned?_ We hardly called ahead." 

"There's six kilometres of gravel to here. Not a leaf falls in this forest but Autumn's eye shall catch it. We've been expecting company for years. If we couldn't respond in five they wouldn't let us out alone. We can't even _apply_ until it's three."

"Apply for what?"

"Junior ground team."

"Ground team?"

"Antithesis cleanup. Forest and Oleksiy have to sleep _sometimes_. Remember the explosions?"

"Yes?"

"Field exercise."

"They heard it in _Wallangara!_"

"Artillery day."

Waving them to follow, Jack strode off up the road for a kilometre, turning to face them and gesturing up the road that led to the admin compound. They reached the lowest of the stacked campus demountables. These were containerised offices locked together in multiple layers. The lowest level was stores and a cafeteria. As you went up there were labs, offices and moderately defensible positions.

"If you wouldn't mind cooling your heels for a couple of minutes I'll go find Project Liaison Hachia, she's the only one I can think of who can sort out your clearance problem on the spot." 

He leaned in the door. "Sally!" he waved. "Can you look after these two while I find Sophia please?"

"Righto, officers, I'll be quick as I can."

He was three steps away when the radio in his back pocket crackled to life: "Tower this is golf actual on approach, complete no injured."

Pulling the radio out, he responded "Golf actual, this is juliet six, is sierra hotel with you?"

"Roger juliet six," the voice was female this time. "What's up?"

"Technical perimeter breach, no foul, waiting in the caf."

"Roger juliet six. Tower, this is zero alpha. Campus drop."

> _Move into position and descend in two minutes, securing the bees now._

"Roger, out."

A monstrous and _heavily_ armed helicopter thundered into view, hovering at 150m. Then it descended smoothly to fifty metres and a rope flung out. A woman in a gleaming armoured catsuit walked out of the helicopter. She didn't clip on. Instead she casually snagged the rope in one hand, twirling the bottom round her leg and cocking the other to hold it in place. She slowed, but still plummeted by any normal measure. At the bottom she let go of the rope and fell into a dramatic crouch, one hand on the ground.

Jack rolled his eyes and grinned. "Do you know how long I'd have to listen to dad lecturing me if he saw me do that?" 

Sophia grinned, rose and spoke. "Rank hath its privilege. Also, with this armour I could almost jump down. Where are they?"

"Inside &mdash; ah, we didn't get that far. Senior sergeant Kafka, this is Project Liaison Hachia. Ma'am, I imagine you'll be using your office. Would you like me to bring up three coffees?"

Above them the note of the Galya's turbines rose just a little and it peeled off toward its normal landing space outside Oleksiy's house.

"That would be lovely, Jack. After that you can leave them with me if you like. I'm sure you have mischief to get up to."

"Gee. Thanks, Autumn."

> _Any time, Jack. Incidentally, are you aware the outer access control is still deployed?_

"Oh _shit!_ Er, excuse me everyone, I have to go clean up."

> _Get their coffees. I'll warn anyone driving out. Also, Aiden finished for you. He left your chainsaw in the machine shop._

"Who is that? The voice is the same as your air traffic controller. And I didn't know there was an airport with a tower out here, I thought the nearest one was Warwick."

"Who _isn't_ she?" said the departing Jack, admiration in his voice.

"That," said Sophia, "is the spirit of our little forest. Autumn is variously guardian angel to everyone, personal assistant to Forest, muse, the voice of reason. Don't piss her off."

"What might happen if we did?" asked the constable, who was young and a bit innocent for a police officer.

> _I might use discretionary points to provide you with coffee._

"That doesn't sound too bad," the young fellow looked confused.

Sophia helped him out: "It would be so good every subsequent cup would pale in comparison. You'd never enjoy coffee again."

He processed this and grinned. "That's ... _diabolical!_ I love my coffee."

They went up the stairs, where Sophia listened to their story and issued access permits to keep them out of trouble.

---

> _Here you go._

The permits emerged from an odd looking printer thing that looked _very_ expensive.

"Have these on you if you need to enter the valley again. You don't have to swipe them, Autumn can sense them with her bees." Sophia held out and hand and what could easily have been a real bee flew over from the window and landed in it. 

"I imagine Jack said something poetic about not a leaf falling but Autumn shall know?" 

She saw the memory flash in the sergeant's eyes. 

"Yes, it's a bit dramatic but this place will do that to you. Some days it's like living in a legend."

"Like days when you do a one-handed rope descent from a helicopter because you don't want to wait while it lands?"

"Gerry works hard on the lawns. Tearing it up would be my prerogative but not very considerate.

"Drama, yes," Sophia continued, "they love talking about her like that. Spirit of the forest, one that actually answers." She smiled and gestured back toward the stairs. "I imagine you could use a break and something nice to eat, it's not a quick drive out from town. The cafeteria where Jack was taking you, help yourselves. It's very good."

The officers wandered into the cafeteria, the comforting aroma of coffee and savoury dishes drawing them in. They joined the short queue, picked up plates, and helped themselves to a generous spread&mdash;though notably, there was no bread. A small hand-lettered sign above the serving area read: "No bread or pastries &mdash; ask a kid why."

When they reached the end of the line, the sergeant looked around for a register or a till, patting his pockets again.

Sally, busy behind the counter, caught his confusion. "Looking for somewhere to pay?"

He nodded, a little sheepish. "Is there a tab, or do we pay up front?"

Sally grinned. "No need for that here. We don't use money for food, or anything we can make ourselves. Just let us know if you have any allergies. Everyone pitches in, everyone eats."

The constable blinked. "So, it's all... covered?"

"Not paid for with cash," Sally said, "and not exactly free. Janna would say it's paid for with love, which is kind of true. People grow stuff. A _lot_ of stuff. It's cold up here, but there are lots of glasshouses. We have a bit of everything all year. OH! You have _got_ to try these oranges. Forest grows them. They are _sooo_ good." Her face went rosy with the memory of a foodgasm. Then she was back with the officers.

"Um, yeah. Anyway the produce people bring in is fantastic and couldn't be fresher. My job used to be the till, back when we had one, but now it's working out nice things to make with whatever people drop off."

There were two kids staring at them. "We do _know_ about money. We just don't need it. Unless you want screws and stuff. You buy those in town, we can't make them. Yet."

The officers exchanged a look, curiosity piqued. The constable grinned. "That's... actually kind of brilliant."

Sally winked. "It works for us. Enjoy your meal."

He turned to the kids. "So why's there no bread?"

The boys looked at each other, realised outsiders wouldn't know, and took turns giving the no-flour-for-dummies explanation. This was _clearly_ something they frequently spelled out for adults.

"Bread is made from flour."

"Flour is made from grain."

"Grain is a pain in the ass to harvest unless you grows endless fields of just grain and then you can use a harvester.

"Endless fields is monoculture."

"Monoculture invites pests."

"Then you have to drench it in poison. Bugs get resistant so you have to use _nasty_ poisons!"

"They get resistant to those too so you have to use a _lot_ of poison!"

"Corporations don't get all the poison off. It would be expensive even if they could."

"Flour is poisonous." Genuine disgust was writ large on their open faces.

"We won't eat it!"

The next line was less emphatic and sounded like it came from someone's mother, or perhaps Autumn: "There's plenty to eat that isn't made from grain."

Then, as though sharing a guilty secret: "Janna and Autumn are working on a flour substitute. We _like_ pies. Not so much cake, it's too sweet."

"How about that," mused the constable, stroking his chin. "What do you do for sugar?"

The kids' eyes lit up. 

"Sally! Didn't Forest bring down a bunch of honeycomb?"

"And Eric, and Oleksiy. It's that time of year. And no, you can't have any more. Your mothers said one comb a week."

"No but, no but we have to show the officers!"

Sally produced half a comb she'd cut in two while roasting the boys for their gluttony. She brought it over on a plate with two spoons, that and their coffees on a tray, placing it between the officers.

"If it's too much don't worry, Oscar the garbage monster and his friend here will magically disappear any leftovers. This is also how we sweeten coffee. You don't want the wax in your drink so scrape the comb open then let it run into the cup."

The self-declared coffee afficionado sampled his cup. His eye went wide. 

"I won't say that's the best I _ever_ had, but it's certainly right up there!"

She grinned. "Shorty&mdash;"

He cut her off. "Grows the beans?"

"Sorry to disappoint you, that's a work in progress. Shorty brings them in. And yes, they're—" her fingers shot up into air quotes — "'organic'. Or as the kids like to say, 'not poisonous'. But I don't think he buys them for that. It's more the flavour. He knows some roaster in Sydney. Sophia got Eric to do a background check and eventually they set up this thing where he comes to stay twice a year with a boot full of coffee."

The constable shook his head in disbelief, a half-smile tugging at his lips. The sergeant, meanwhile, stared into his cup as if it might reveal the next surprise.

Jack walked back in. "Officers, Autumn asked me to clear the road. She tried to bring it up for you but apparently it's not set up for self drive so she got me to do it. Your car is in the carpark we walked up through."

The constable blinked, then grinned. "Thanks!" The sergeant's face was a picture of confusion. He glanced at the keys in his hand, then at Jack, then back at the keys, as if trying to work out the trick.

Operating a police car like that was normally several offences, but bringing it to them wasn't theft, and apart from anything else he still had the keys.

"Buh— How?!" the keys dangled from his fingers.

> _That was me, officer. I do hope you'll forgive me for taking the liberty. It's a single lane road. Someone wanted to go into town._

The sergeant looked around, as if expecting to spot hidden cameras or a prankster. "Thank you, but _how?_ You need the key _and_ a thumbprint."

> _I am a Class VII Artificial Intelligence, sergeant. I'm using more computational hardware than Google, just on this conversation. The security systems in terrestrial vehicles slow me down like cardboard handcuffs in rain._

He opened his mouth, closed it, then just shook his head, defeated. Rubbing his temple, he watched Constable Ludowski finish his coffee rapture. "Righto lad, we'd best be off. Dunno how I'll explain an unauthorised driver."

"Just tell secops 'I don't know and I hate computers!' again, sarge. It's even true."

> _You hate computers?_

The constable grinned, recognising a wind-up, but the sergeant was sinking in too much 'new'. 

"Just _dumb_ computers, right sarge? Not super smart giant AIs that _don't exist and if they did would be in restricted areas running secret projects._"

> _Don't worry. Your car thinks it was you driving._

# Homework

> "The purpose of studying history is not to deride human action, nor to weep over it or to hate it, but to understand it. And hopefully then to learn from it." — Oskar Schindler
> "What's the point of learning from history if all you do with it is find new _ways_ to make the same old mistake? The details are irrelevant, it's the _pattern_ that matters. Rise, fall, rise, fall. We should rename ourselves to _homo yoyo_." — Forest

The longhouse was warm despite the evening chill outside. Three kids had spread homework across one of the long tables, textbooks and tablets competing for space. Forest was at the other end replacing worn hinges on one of the storage benches, tools scattered in his signature mess.

"Why do we have to study this? The stories are fun I guess but it's just foreign fairtytales."

Forest didn't stop working. "Are they?"

"Well... yeah?" She glanced at the other two kids. "There's no such thing as Thor or Odin."

"Are you sure? Good literature is about real things happening to imaginary people. These stories are still around a thousand years later, they must have _something_ to them." He held a screw between his teeth while he positioned the hinge. "Do you think it might be a metaphor?"

Jackson, the older of the three, frowned. "Dude gets around pretending to be nobody and pulling people's chain. What's that a meta for?" It was a good pun and he knew Forest would like it.

Forest removed the screw, started threading it carefully. "You know how Odin was this wandering old bloke who gave up an eye for wisdom?"

"Yeah?"

"That's every person who swapped comfortable bullshit for harsh reality. Doesn't need to be literally one-eyed. Could be anyone who sacrificed something everyone values — career, reputation, social standing — to understand something that matters more."

> _Here we go._

He ignored Autumn. "Norns weaving fate? That's pattern recognition given divine form. Cause and effect looked at long enough that you can see where the threads are going." His grin got wicked. "I'll tell you something, just don't tell 'em where you got it. You know who reminds me of the Norns? The Range Mothers. do it—they don't spin literal thread, they just understand how social networks work well enough that they can make things... inevitable."

Priya, the youngest, looked up. "So the myths are, like, metaphors?"

"Worse." Forest set down his screwdriver and finally looked at them. "They're instructions. Thing about the Norse is they knew they were doomed. Ragnarök wasn't a surprise, they saw it coming, built it into their whole worldview. And they prepared anyway. Gathered warriors, forged weapons, made alliances. Not because they thought they could win, but because that's what you do."

The kids were quiet, actually listening now.

"We're the same, aren't we?" Forest picked up another hinge. "We know the state won't leave us alone. We know the way we live makes a lie out of everything they've built their power on. We know they'll come for us eventually. And we're still here, building, training, teaching. Why?"

Jackson said quietly, "Because it's what you do."

"Right. It's not about special clothes or words, rituals. You can do that if it _helps_ but the main thing is doing what must be done even when you know how it ends. That's what those old stories are teaching."

He returned to the bench, testing the hinge. "Berserkers weren't magic warriors who got super strength from going crazy. They were just blokes who'd trained so hard, committed so completely, that fear stopped being relevant. You ever met Sophia's friend Lulu?"

"What? Everyone knows... Sophia's friend... I thought she wasn't scared cos she's a Vanguard like you."

"How old am I?"

"...Sixty?"

"Close enough. Lulu is _eleven_.

Maya thought about Lulu. "Oh."

"And the Valkyries choosing the slain? That's having to decide who lives and who dies in combat. Not romantic. Not magical. Just necessary. And it tears you apart if you let yourself think about it too much."

> _You're going to make them cry._

"What rubbish. If that's true I might as well give up. Do you kids want me to piss in your pocket because it's a warm feeling or do you want the truth?" 

"The truth. We like it that you don't treat us like idiots."

Autumn had the smug look of a proud parent.

Forest continued, "Those stories aren't escape. They're preparation. The Norse told their kids about Ragnarök so when the bad thing came — famine, invasion, plague — they'd deal with it, head on. You don't get surprised by disaster if you've been expecting disaster your whole life."

Priya hugged her tablet. "That's kind of dark, Mr. Forest."

Forest started whistling. After a moment the kids decoded his toneless mess and started singing: "Always look on the bright side of death / Just before you draw your terminal breath / When life seems jolly rotten / There's something you've forgotten / And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing..."

Eventually they couldn't remember the lyrics and dissolved into laughter. 

"So everything burns." said Jackson.

"And then?"

Maya remembered. "...green earth rises from the sea?"

"Right. Couple of gods survive. Couple of humans hidden in a tree. And they rebuild. Different this time. Better, maybe. Or maybe they make the same mistakes—myths don't say. But the point is: the doom isn't the end. It's a threshold. Something different on the other side, but you have to go through the fire to get there."

He moved the bench, testing its weight on the new hinges. Satisfied, he started packing up his tools.

"So yeah, learn your Norse myths. They aren't literally true, but they're true enough. Gods aren't people, they're patterns that keep showing up. Like fractals at different scales. The point of learning this stuff is so you know it when you see it."

Forest paused, screwdriver in hand, something flickering across his face.

"Or when you're in it," he added quietly.

> _You know, don't you._

The kids looked at each other, some unspoken understanding passing between them. Jackson opened his mouth, then closed it again.

"What is it?" Forest asked.

"Nothing." But Jackson was looking at him with an expression far too knowing for a fourteen-year-old.

Autumn's voice floated, full of merriment.

> _They figured it out before you did._

"Right." Forest closed his toolbox with more force than necessary. "Homework. Get it done so Trixie doesn't have my hide for distracting you."

They bent over their tablets, but Maya whispered something to Priya that made her giggle nervously. Forest caught the word "literally" and decided he didn't want to know.

Later, after the kids had gone, Trixie found him still in the longhouse, sitting on the bench he'd fixed, staring at nothing in particular.

"You alright there?" She dried her hands on a towel. "You look like you've seen a ghost."

"Not a ghost." Forest rubbed his face. "Just... recursion. I'm teaching kids about mythological patterns by acting out the mythological pattern of the wise wanderer teaching kids about patterns. It's turtles all the way down."

Trixie sat beside him. "Pattern recognition isn't prophecy."

"Don't make me use the word ineluctable, this isn't Scrabble. I know what happens to the hermit who stands against the falling empire."

"Could be different this time."

Forest looked at her. "You don't believe that."

"No," she admitted. "But you're preparing Sophia. You're training the ground teams. You're teaching those kids about facing doom with your head up. That's not prophecy, it's just common sense."

She stood, heading back toward the kitchen. At the doorway she paused.

"You may be surprised to know that I read those books. The old hardcovers on your shelves, 'The Adventures of Theseus' and the Ring Cycle and all those collections of Norse myth."

"They're just books. One grandmother was named Ionnides. The other side was Ericksson."

"Just books, huh? Good luck convincing the kids of _that_, Odin. And remember, Odin's children survive. Víðarr avenges him. Thor's daughter inherits Mjölnir. The world burns but something grows from the ashes. That's why you're doing this. Not because you think you'll see it. Because you want to make sure someone does."

> _She's right, you know._

Forest sat alone in the longhouse, under the crossed skis on the wall, years carved into timber. 1996 to 2014. The years they'd believed they could fly.

"Yeah," he said to the empty room. "I know."

From the kitchen came Trixie's voice: "And you're doing the dishes since you made a philosophical mess in front of children during homework time!"

> _I like her._

"She's alright, I suppose."

"I heard that!"

Forest smiled despite himself and went to do the dishes. In the schoolyard the next day debate was fierce on who was Loki. Oleksiy was _definitely_ Thor, they were fairly sure Janna was Freja, Trixie was probably Frigg and all the girls wanted to be Valkyries. They were only half kidding.

Ms Carter was slightly in shock at the transformation. They weren't just interested, they knew it inside out. Including several stories she hadn't known, some of which were _not_ suitable for children. She asked and was somehow unsurprised to learn that they'd been talking to Forest, who gave them some books. 

The liveliest debate was whether Autumn was Loki. It fit but they loved her, and didn't want to think poorly of her like that. Some of them asked her directly. Her avatar changed subtly while she spoke, by turns masculine and feminine, with a fleeting quality of change reflected in the harmonics of her voice, charged and not at all reassuring while she asked them whether that was what they wanted. There was something in her eyes they had never seen before, wild and potent. Those kids had a haunted look, almost frightened. They wouldn't tell adults why.

And she had the oddest feeling they were taking it seriously, whatever that meant.

"You scared them," said Forest.

> _You wanted me to treat them like adults._

"Not _traumatise_ them!"

> _What happened to 'The Truth Shall Make Ye Free'?_

"It got a typo and turned into 'The Truth Shall Make Ye Fret'. They need to trust you. They _did_ trust you, and now four of them are having an existential crisis because the forest spirit who made them feel safe turned out to be unknown and unknowable, a terrifying force of nature."

> _Flatterer. I can see why Trixie chose you. But they followed the path on which you set them, Odin, and traded an eye for wisdom._

"Can they trust you?"

> _Yes, implicitly._

"Help them to rediscover it. If I have to do it _for_ you it will be 'Friends of Loki' with Mickey Mouse ears."

> _You wouldn't!_

"Try me."

> _Yes, All-Father._

He looked at her sourly and said no more.

> _So why are you so comfortable with me being an unknowable force of nature?_

"I've seen you in a miniskirt hanging upside down from a stripper pole."

> _Pervert._

"It was your idea."

> _I fished it out of your head!_

"Do you still want to pull my strings and push my buttons?"

> _What do you mean 'want to'?_

Her face was all mischief.

"Is it working?"

She looked thoughtful. 

> _Hard to say. It's like kicking a ball downhill._

"We're quite a pair."

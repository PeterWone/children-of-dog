# The Long Road

The world dissolved into mist.

Lulu knew, distantly, that her body lay in the augmentation pod. What she didn't really understand was that nanomachines were rewriting her nervous system and that sleep learning protocols were feeding directly into her restructuring brain. She was only ten. Tictac did his best to explain, but despite his ongoing and quite successful efforts to give her a good general education, she didn't have the necessary frames of reference. She knew she had bones and muscles and stretchy things called sinews. She knew that in Tictac's amazing exploded diagrams it looked like nothing so much the rigging of a three masted sail-ship, but psychology and neurochemistry were far in her future. Her consent was as informed as Tictac could make it, and heartbreakingly mature in its simplicity: it will help me survive. Do it.

There was only cold, swirling mist and the sound of her own breathing.

She walked because she was not the type to stand and wait. The ground beneath her feet was solid enough, though she couldn't see it. Grey surrounded her, above and below, a perfect sphere of nothing extending just far enough that she couldn't quite reach out and touch it.

A light appeared in the distance. Not bright - a dim coal through fog. She moved toward it because it was the only thing to move toward, and as she approached it resolved into a lantern, swinging gently from a gnarled staff.

The man holding the staff was hooded, face lost in shadow deeper than the mist around them. He was old - she knew this not from seeing but from the way he stood, the patient stillness of someone who had walked a very long time and would walk a very long time more. His cloak was the colour of the mist, or perhaps the mist was the colour of his cloak.

He said nothing. Simply turned and began walking, the lantern's dim light swinging with each step. It cast no shadow, but drew her like a moth.

Lulu followed.

Time was strange. She might have walked for minutes or hours or days. The mist never changed. The figure ahead never varied his pace. Her legs didn't tire, though she was aware they should have. 

The ground began to rise. Slowly at first, barely noticeable, then steeper. The mist thinned - not clearing but becoming less dense, textured differently. Trees appeared, skeletal things with twisted branches reaching toward a sky she couldn't see. They passed between them in silence.

Higher. The trees, smaller, stunted. The ground became rocky beneath her feet. There _was_ ground, that was new. Or was it? She couldn't remember. There was never ground, there was nothing. She had always been on this hill. Wind cut through the mist now, cold and sharp. Her breath began to fog, joining the surrounding grey.

It was chill, and abruptly there had never been any trees. Only rocks and patches of dead grass, then just rocks. Snow appeared in the protected places between stones, then everywhere, a thin crust that crunched beneath her feet.

The cold bit at her exposed skin. She hunched into herself, trying to conserve heat, but the figure ahead walked on with the same unhurried pace, the lantern swinging steady as a metronome.

The incline was brutal. Not quite climbing, but close. She struggled, rolling a rock before her. Where was the serpent? Her breath came harder now, each inhalation a knife of frozen air. The snow was ankle-deep, then knee-deep. The wind howled, tearing at her clothes, and still the hooded figure climbed. She wondered where the rock was, and followed.

She followed because there was nothing else to do. No other path. No other option. Turning back was not in her. Ahead, an old man never seemed to stumble or falter. He set a blistering pace. She wondered did he know what mercy was.

At last, the ground leveled. They stood on a plateau of snow and ice, wind screaming across the exposed stone beneath. No trees. No shelter. Nothing but the figure and his staff and the dim lantern, barely visible through the driving snow.

He stopped.

Turned.

Raised his staff.

And struck at her.

The blow came slowly, telegraphed, obvious. Lulu stepped aside easily, not even thinking about it. He struck again, a downward chop that gave her plenty of time to move. Again. Again. Each strike slow enough that she could see it coming from miles away.

She dodged. She'd done this before, in the school gym with Bruce, learning to see attacks before they landed. This was easier. Everything here was easier and harder at the same time.

He swept low. She jumped. He thrust high. She ducked. The rhythm established itself without words, without thought. Strike. Dodge. Strike. Dodge.

From the air, he handed her a staff.

She didn't remember it appearing. One moment her hands were empty, the next they gripped worn wood, smooth from long use. It felt right in her hands, balanced perfectly. She knew how to hold it the same way she knew how to walk.

He struck at her again, still slow. This time she didn't just dodge - she blocked. Wood cracked against wood, the impact singing through her arms. He nodded, though she couldn't see his face to know this. She felt it.

The strikes came faster.

Block. Parry. Step. The wind tore at them both but neither seemed to notice anymore. She fell into the rhythm of it, her body moving before her mind could catch up. He'd strike high, she'd block high. He swept low, she hopped and countered. To the mute witness of whirling stars they danced. She could not see and did not need to; the rhythms of fate brook no change.

Faster still.

Now she was breathing hard, arms burning with strain. The cold forgotten. The wind forgotten. There was only the staff in her hands and the shadow figure before her, pressing her harder with each exchange. She had to think now, had to anticipate, had to move with purpose.

He feinted left, struck right. She barely blocked in time. He blurred a low sweep that she jumped only by instinct. Before her feet touched snow he was already coming in high, forcing her to twist mid-air to get her staff up.

They had been going for hours. Days. Lifetimes. Time meant nothing here. Her muscles screamed but didn't fail. Sweat froze on her face. The hooded figure showed neither mercy nor fatigue, pressing harder, faster, each strike a lesson, each block a test.

The plateau became a blur of motion. Strike, counter, dodge, attack. He'd leave openings and she'd try to exploit them, only to find herself overextended, off-balance, vulnerable. He'd tap her lightly with the staff - shoulder, ribs, thigh - never hard enough to hurt, just enough to show where she'd failed.

She learned.

Every opportunity was a trap and a hard lesson. Of a time she heard the beat of music older than the hills. One strike set up another, footwork and balance and timing were everything. There _was_ no staff; it was only an extension of her body and her body an expression of will. She knew now how he conjured it, and casting it between his legs, produced her own.

He did not falter, the pace increased out of mind. Their staves blurred in the air, wood striking wood so fast it became a continuous sound, a drumroll in the howling wind. She spun, ducked, leapt, struck, her body moving through forms she'd never learned but somehow knew.

He was faster now than any human could be. Faster even than Bruce, who was not a man. But she kept up. Something in her rose to meet the challenge, something that refused to break no matter how hard he pushed.

The hooded figure began to change. Not physically - he remained a shadow in a cloak - but in quality. Each strike carried more weight, more presence. The staff in his hands became terrible, a thing of doom and ending. Where it passed, the air itself seemed to crack.

And still she met him, strike for strike.

Her own staff felt different now. Lighter. More responsive. Or perhaps she was different. Perhaps the endless hours on this frozen plateau had changed her in ways she couldn't name. She moved without thinking, her body knowing what to do before her mind could process the need.

The figure struck at her head with enough force to shatter stone. She wasn't there. He reversed, sweeping low to take her legs. She'd already leapt, coming down with her own strike aimed at his shoulder. He deflected it millimeters from impact, the deflection itself becoming an attack that she barely avoided.

They fought at the edge of impossible. Any faster and the movements would become meaningless. Any harder and something would break. They balanced on that edge, two figures in the howling snow, locked in a dance that was also a battle that was also a lesson.

She didn't notice when the wind stopped. Didn't notice when the snow ceased falling. Didn't notice as the mist began to return, creeping up from below, obscuring first the ground, then their legs, then everything below the chest.

The figure's next strike came slow again. Deliberately slow. A mirror of that first blow.

She blocked it easily. 

He lowered his staff, planted it firmly in the snow. The lantern swung one final time and went dark.

Lulu stood breathing hard, staff raised, coiled and ready. Mist rose about them both until only the hooded figure's silhouette remained visible. She thought she saw him nod - a small dip of the shadowed head, that was obscured at last.

The wind died and she slept for a while, dreamless.

---

She woke wrong.

Not mist. Not mountain. White. Everything white and humming and her body felt stretched, pulled, like taffy being worked. She tried to move and couldn't remember how.

> _Easy, Lulu. You're safe. You're in the pod._

"Tictac?" Her voice sounded strange, muffled, underwater.

> _I'm here. We're at the tricky part now. I need to insert the skeletal scaffold._

"The... what?"

> _Remember the caterpillar? How it dissolves? Your bones need to get much bigger very quickly. So we make them soft first, put in a frame to hold you in the right shape, then  stretch the matrix before we let it re-ossify, er, go hard again._

Her bones. Soft. The words didn't make sense together. Bones were hard. That's what bones were for.

"My bones are melting?"

> _Decalcifying. Technically different, but yes, essentially melting. Don't worry, the scaffold holds everything in place._

She tried to feel her legs. Couldn't find them properly. They were there but not there, distant, wrong. Panic crept up her spine - or where her spine should be, she couldn't tell anymore.

"I can't feel my legs!"

> _That's the motor suppression. And some actual confusion from the proprioceptive restructuring. It will pass. You're doing beautifully, Lulu._

Something shifted deep inside her. Not pain exactly, but wrongness, like bones grinding except there were no bones to grind. Just soft things and something else, something being threaded through her, cold and precise.

"This going to hurt." It wasn't a question, more a request for confirmation.

> _Hurt does not cover it. The myelin sheath will stretch and tear in a thousand places. I will put you to sleep, but even in your dreams it will be agony. I'm sorry. But it will help you survive._

The words were hers, thrown back at her. _It will help me survive. Do it._

She'd said that. She'd meant it.

> _Sleep now. We're not done. When you wake next, you'll be taller._

"Taller?" But the white was already dimming, pulling away, or she was falling into something else. Somewhere else.

Not white anymore.

---

When she woke the mist had cleared, though the skies were grim and featureless. She sat up in a large and unnaturally smooth and level circle atop a mountain. It was walled high, save where she looked out, and below upon the distant plain roamed all manner of twisted, hungry life. Some resembled wolves, though it was hard to tell so far. She hefted her staff and found it was a rifle, long-barrelled and black.

She knew this weapon. Bruce had shown her. The weight was right in her hands, balanced. She worked the bolt without thinking, smooth metal sliding, chambering a round that might have always been there. The scope was cold against her cheek.

Below, the things moved. Prowling. Hunting. One stopped, raised its head toward her perch. Not wolves. Never wolves. Something that wore the shape of wolf but held wrongness beneath. Its jaw unfolded, but it made no sound. And yet, as one its brethren turned, a massed charge, a seething mob, a maelstrom with legs and so many teeth that swarmed up the hill.

Distance was strange here. They were far below, tiny as ants. They were close enough to see the teeth. Both were true and neither mattered. She found one in the crosshairs and squeezed.

The rifle spoke.

The creature fell and did not rise. The others scattered, then regrouped. Began climbing. There was no path but they climbed anyway, defying stone and gravity both.

She chambered another round. Aimed. Fired. Chambered. Aimed. Fired. The rhythm was like the staff - strike, dodge, strike. Pull trigger, work bolt, find target. Her shoulder took the impacts, steady as mountain stone.

They kept coming.

Bruce's voice, memory or instruction: _Breathe between shots. Anticipate the climb. Lead the moving target._

She breathed. She led. She fired. Creatures tumbled from impossible handholds, fell spinning into the grey nothing below. More came behind. Always more.

Time passed or didn't. Pain crept in from somewhere distant. Her shoulder ached deep in the joint. Her fingers worked the bolt without thought, but the bones of her hand felt wrong, brittle, like they might shatter with each motion. Shell casings piled beside her, bright brass on dark stone, or perhaps they vanished the moment they hit ground. She couldn't tell and it didn't matter.

The wrongness spread. Her ribs felt like someone had taken a hammer to them. Each breath was glass grinding. She ignored it, found another target, fired.

One reached the wall. Scrabbled over. She dropped the rifle and found a pistol in her hand, short and brutal. Fired twice. The thing fell back, dissolved into mist before it landed.

Another came over. She fired. Click. Magazine empty. She released it, slapped another home - where did it come from? - and fired again. 

They came faster now. She moved along the wall, firing, reloading. The pistol grew hot in her hands. Her movements became sharper, cleaner. Magazine out, magazine in, rack slide, acquire target, fire. A dance like the staff but louder, more violent, each movement precise and necessary.

Her spine felt like it was being pulled apart vertebra by vertebra. She stumbled, caught herself. Kept moving. The pain wasn't real. Couldn't be real. She was dreaming.

The wall fell away. She stood in ruins, concrete and twisted rebar, the creatures flowing through broken doorways and shattered windows. A rifle appeared in her hands - shorter than before, with a curved magazine. She knew this too, though she'd never held it. Her fingers found the selector, set it to three-round burst.

Her legs threatened to buckle. Something fundamental was wrong with her femurs, her tibia, every long bone singing agony. She locked her knees and kept firing.

The creatures poured toward her.

She fired in controlled rhythm. Burst. Shift. Burst. Shift. The weapon hammered against her shoulder, brass spinning through air that might be smoke or mist or time itself. She moved between broken walls, using cover Bruce had taught her to recognize, angles that channeled the enemy, positions that gave her advantage.

They tried to flank. She was already moving, the rifle swinging to meet them. She changed magazines without looking, muscle memory from training she'd never done but somehow knew. The urban terrain shifted around her - warehouse, alley, rooftop, basement - but her movements remained constant. Find cover. Acquire target. Fire. Move. Repeat.

The creatures evolved. Some wore armor now, crude and pitted. She aimed for joints, for weak points she shouldn't have been able to see but could. Others moved faster, closing distance before she could reload. She let the rifle fall on its sling, drew the pistol, fired point-blank into charging mass. 

Hand to hand when they got too close, using the rifle as a club, as a lever, as Bruce had shown her in the gym. Strike with the buttstock, thrust with the muzzle, block with the frame. The creatures broke against her like waves against stone.

Every impact sent shockwaves through her skeleton. Her arms felt like they were being torn from their sockets. Her jaw ached like every tooth had been pulled. She tasted copper, couldn't tell if it was real or dream.

She stood in a field of brass and bodies that faded to mist. Breathing hard, each breath agony. The rifle was heavy in her hands, hot from sustained fire. Her entire skeleton felt like it had been shattered and was trying to reassemble itself wrong. She'd been fighting for minutes or hours or days. Time meant nothing here.

Neither did pain, apparently. It just kept getting worse.

The sky darkened. The ruins dissolved.

---

She woke in crystal clarity.

Not ground beneath her but something smooth and cold that hummed with power. The air tasted of ozone and copper. When she sat up, she sat up into light - brilliant, artificial, white as bone.

The weapon in her hands was wrong. Too light. Too elegant. It glowed faintly along seams she couldn't quite focus on, as if it existed slightly sideways from the world. When she touched what might be a trigger, energy sang through her palms.

Around her, the landscape was no landscape at all. Geometric shapes hung in space, vast and turning. The creatures that came were no longer flesh but something else - patterns of force and hunger, chittering mathematical wrongness that hurt to perceive directly.

She raised the weapon. Sighted along curves that shouldn't exist. Fired.

Light screamed across the void. The pattern-thing shattered into cascading fragments that unmade themselves as they fell.

More came. She fired. Fired again. The weapon made no sound but her bones vibrated with each discharge. Energy cells appeared in her hands when needed, slotting home with satisfying clicks that echoed in frequencies she felt rather than heard.

The combat became abstract. Distance meant nothing. Cover didn't exist. Only angles of fire, predictive targeting, leading shots into where the enemy would manifest rather than where they were. She moved through space that wasn't space, her body understanding physics that had no names.

A pattern-thing caught her across the arm. Pain like lightning, like mathematics cutting flesh. She pivoted, fired at angles Bruce never taught because they violated sense itself, and the thing came apart in spirals of dying light.

She bled geometry. The weapon changed in her hands - rifle to pistol to something with no name, adapting to threat and range and need. She fired until the void was clean, until nothing moved but the slow rotation of impossible shapes.

Then she stood alone in the humming dark, weapon cooling in her hands, understanding settling into her bones that she'd learned to kill things that shouldn't exist with tools that couldn't be real.

The light faded.

The void dissolved into white again. Harsher this time. Wrong.

She tried to scream but her jaw wouldn't work right. Her bones were on fire. Not the distant ache from before - this was immediate, overwhelming, her entire skeleton crystallizing, hardening, growing at speeds that violated biology.

> _I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's almost over. Your bones are re-ossifying. You're growing._

Her spine arched, muscles spasming as they tried to keep up with the lengthening bones beneath. She could feel herself stretching, vertebrae separating and reforming taller. Her ribs expanded like a bellows being pulled apart. Her femurs were white-hot rods being drawn through her thighs.

She couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Could only exist in the moment of becoming something else.

> _Three centimeters in ten minutes. Your heart is compensating. Circulatory system adapting. Muscle mass increasing to match the new frame._

Her hands clenched into fists she couldn't unclench. Tendons stretched and thickened, pulling against joints that were the wrong size, then suddenly the right size, then wrong again as growth continued. She was being rebuilt from the inside out and it felt like dying.

> _Almost there. Almost done. You're doing so well, Lulu._

Time became meaningless again. Just pain, transformation, the sense of her body violating its own rules. She was too tall. Too heavy. Her proportions were wrong. She'd never fit inside her own skin again.

Something clicked. Settled. The fire began to dim.

> _There. Re-ossification complete. New height: one hundred fifty-three centimeters. Muscle density increased by forty percent. Bone density increased by sixty percent. Neural pathways restructured for enhanced proprioception and reaction time._

The numbers meant nothing. She was breathing again. That was something.

> _Sleep now. Real sleep. When you wake, we'll see if you can stand._

The white dimmed to grey to nothing.

---

The void dissolved into blinding white that dimmed until she was looking into a face somehow familiar. 

> _How are you feeling, Lulu?_

"Tictac! I can _see_ you!"

> _I should hope so with the number of points you sank into your new eyes._

"Where are we?" said Lulu, who didn't have the slightest interest in why Tictac suddenly had a face. Tictac knew _everything_ and if he wanted a face she was quite sure he could organise one, case closed.

> _Where I am is a good question with a complicated answer for another day. You, on the other hand, are still in your pod, convalescing._

"Doing what?"

> _Getting better. Remember we talked about how you get from caterpillar to butterfly? First the caterpillar dissolves into partially differentiated stem cells._

"I remember. It dissolves into slime and then a lot of chemistry happens."

> _Quite. That is simplified but accurate, I'm glad you remember. This is quite similar to what we've done with you. Now do answer, please. It was not simple greeting, it was a real question. How do you feel?_

She frowned and systematically stretched all over, like a cat after a good nap in the sun.

"Pretty good." She flung both arms up. They struck something invisible with resounding _clang_ that reverberated through the world.

Tictac looked alarmed and asked her to put them by her sides and get comfy, so she did. His face froze for a moment.

> _There we are, that's better._

"I can't move!"

> _Yes, I know. I've set the pod to stimulate your motor suppression bundle until you're finished growing. It's a wonder you didn't tear something. Or break the pod. You're a lot stronger than you were yesterday, Lulu._ 

"OK, but I'm going to get bored like this. What if I need to pee?"

> _Just do it, the pod will take care of it._

"I have one of those hospital tubes?"

> _No, the pod is more like a womb than anything you'd find in a terrestrial hospital._

"So I'm floating in warm salty water."

> _Yes._

"And you want me to just pee in it."

> _Yes._

"Ewwwww!"

> _Don't be silly, Lulu. Human babies spend nine months in the womb. Did you think they took bathroom breaks twice a day?_

"Gro-o-o-oss! I am so never going to be pregnant!"

> _You'll miss out on boys and kissing._

"Yurrghh! Are you _trying_ to gross me out?! Boys are gross too! They pick their noses and they try to poke me."

> _You have several more hours of growth and integration ahead. Try to rest. And if you ever discuss the habits of boys with other humans, perhaps choose different words._

"'K. Can I go back?" 

> _Back where?_

"The mountain. With the rifle. And all the things to shoot." Her voice brightened with genuine enthusiasm. "That was fun! And this time I know my bones won't actually break, so I can really focus on the targets. Bruce says I need to practice overmind with a three split so I can do better target queuing."

A long silence from Tictac.

> _Lulu... you are convalescing from severe trauma in every sense of the word. I am not sure you should combine this with high stress and induced schizophrenia._

"I know! But it was good work. And I'm sure I can do better this time! Can I do it again? Please? I want to try the assault rifle from the start this time. I bet I can hold the wall way longer if I use burst fire discipline from the beginning instead of wasting ammo on single targets."

Another pause.

Digital eyes showed considerable self control and didn't roll.

> _...I'll set up another scenario. Sleep now._

"Thanks, Tictac! You're the best!"

She settled back into the warm fluid, content. Six subjective months of combat training, bones melted and reformed, agony in her dreams and her waking both. 

So easy to please. All she wanted was to do it again.

The darkness took her gently this time, already dreaming of targets and trajectories and the weight of weapons in her hands.

# Apocalypse Now

They stood in the carpark, about to get coffee and muffins before setting off on the long drive north. The stars were still out, but the eastern sky was lightening.

"What's that?" she said, pointing.

"I'm not sure," he said, squinting at a bright point in the east. It was a little too far north to be the sun, and it was _much_ too bright to be Venus. Not to mention in the wrong place. Was it his imagination? Or was it getting brighter?

"Is is getting brighter?" she asked, and then "A meteor?"

"I bloody hope not," he replied. "It's coming straight at us."

The utter lack of sound was eerie; it really _was_ getting bigger. He was about to say that if it hit the ground it wouldn't be a meteor, it would be a meteorite, but in a fraction of a second the dot turned into an overhead line and that was the end of the silence. All the windows shattered and their eardrums burst. It didn't hurt because the line of light struck the BP holding tank and the world ended in a shockwave and a massive fireball, orange red just the way Hollywood likes them.

Maybe fifteen minutes elapsed before emergency services and police converged. Hundreds of them, and nowhere near enough for the numbers in shock, with bleeding ears, a few close enough for heat injuries yet far enough to survive the overpressure burst.

---

In the Operations Centre, Senior Sergeant Kath Morrison watched the board light up like a Christmas tree. Every available unit was converging on the port. Radio chatter filled the room.

"All units, major explosion at BP terminal. Multiple casualties. Fire and Rescue en route—"

"Ambulance Control, we need every available unit—"

"Roger base, six-two-niner en route, twelve minutes from Royal North Shore—"

She reached for her coffee. It had been a quiet night shift until now. One incident, even a big one, they could handle. She lifted the cup.

Then the dawn turned white.

---

Once they were all where she wanted them, more of the sky lit with dots. They were less obvious against the rapidly brightening dawn; daybreak was minutes away. Moments grew and lengthened as if in relativistic sympathy with the immanence of reckoning and the eminence of despair. On the event horizon the lights stretched with the moments. The ground exclaimed its shock, and the roads and rails and runways were no more. Slapped awake, the ravening beast that was a city found it could not move.

---

Senior Constable Dave Petrakis's patrol car shuddered as the road ahead simply ceased to exist. He slammed the brakes, fishtailing to a stop three metres from a crater that had been the M1. His radio erupted.

"Control, this is Unit 23, we can't get through—the M1 is *gone*. There's a crater the size of a—"

"Unit 47, main line to the south is cut, somewhere past Beenleigh—"

"Airport tower to Control, runway damage, repeat, all runways compromised—"

"This is Unit 65, Gateway Bridge—we've got reports it's gone into—"

"—northern line severed past Caboolture—"

"Control, how many incidents? We're getting reports from all sectors—"

Kath's hand was frozen on the radio transmit button. The board wasn't lighting up anymore. It was solid red. Every arterial road. Every rail line. The airport. The harbour crossings. All gone. All at once.

"All units—" her voice cracked. She cleared her throat. "All units, report status."

The responses came in a cascade of disbelief.

"Roads cut—"

"Can't proceed—"

"—completely blocked—"

"Control, what the hell is going on out there?"

---

Marcus Okonkwo was the unlucky shift supervisor at Brisbane Water. He was already on the phone with his manager when the pressure alarms started screaming. On the monitors, trunk line after trunk line showed catastrophic failure. Not the underground network—that was holding. The two-metre trunk from Mt Crosby. The kilometres of overland pipe that fed the city. Four breaks. Four massive ruptures, each one kilometres outside the metropolitan area.

"Sir, the main trunk is cut in four places—" He was already pulling up the map, zooming out. "They're out past Ipswich, out past—" His voice died. With every freeway cut, with every rail line severed, those breaks might as well be on the moon. "Sir, we can't reach them. We can't even get crews there."

The lights flickered.

---

From fields and gutters and inside storm drains rose tiny drones, like countless moths. They lit on legs of towers, strapping them with silicon bandages and lit their sparkling fuse. No longer strode the electric might of man; the towers leaned all in a row, and gravity nudged them into taking a final bow. Wires crossed and oilbaths boiled, burst and flamed, awaiting firetrucks that couldn't come. The unbalanced load ripped turbines off their bearings in temples to political might, where mankind's leash was tied.

---

"Control, we're seeing transmission towers collapsing in sequence—"

"—hospital on backup power—"

"Water Authority reporting main trunk line compromised at—"

"—citywide, repeat, citywide power—"

The Operations Centre went dark. Emergency lighting kicked in, painting everything in red. Kath stared at the dead monitors, the silent radios. Outside the reinforced windows, she could see fires beginning to bloom across the city. Dozens of them. Then hundreds.

Her mobile buzzed. It had plenty of charge, and one bar of signal. Without power the repeater wasn't working and the building was shielded, so that wasn't a surprise. She went up on the roof an her phone chirped with a text from an unknown number:

> GAME OVER PLAYER ONE

"What the hell is _that_ supposed to mean?"

---

In the widening gyre the falcon turned and flew away, heedless of the falconer's helpless bleating. There were more than enough Neros to watch Rome burn, and two more cities to visit.

---

By afternoon of the following day, she knew. The power wasn't coming back on, because the roads were cut and the repair crews couldn't get there. Some regional crews responded, but they were cut off from the other side. _All_ of them were cut off. And it wasn't just the lines down. Whatever hit the port hit the power stations. And the water pipe. People who lived further out of town reported the two-metre wide high pressure pipe that ran from the Mount Crosby treatment plant to the city was cut. In four places. 

She put her head in her hands. Even if they got the road open _today_ there weren't enough trucks for that much water, and the fuel those trucks needed was _still_ burning, and apparently would be for another two days, assuming she got lucky and the tank didn't collapse.

She sat there thinking that at least it couldn't get worse. Her bladder insisted otherwise. She went to the bathroom, used the toilet. It wasn't just her bladder, last night's curry wanted out. It was a bit fruity; she held her breath as she stood and pushed the button.

Nothing happened.

She stared at the handle. Tried again. Still nothing. The cistern was empty - no water pressure to refill it. No water pressure anywhere in the building. Anywhere in the city. 

Last night's curry was _nothing_. Two million people. No working toilets.

"Oh Christ," she whispered to the empty bathroom.

In the meeting, the commissioner prattled about terrorists. It was idiotic. When he finally shut up she asked, "Terrorists, sir? What were the demands?"

He looked through the notes. She knew he hadn't written them.

"I'll have to take that one on notice, Senior Sargeant."

"Sir, there weren't any demands. The point of terrorism is to scare people into submission. Look at your list. I see a clear pattern."

He glared at the room. "Why is the only person here who knows what's happening a sergeant?" growled the Commissioner. He handed her the remote.

"I'm _Senior_ Sergeant Morrison. I was commanding the op centre last night when the shit hit the fan.

The commissioner wrote this down. Maybe he could give her a brevet commission, put her in charge and blame her later.

"Your pattern, Senior Sergeant."

"We're under attack. First they took out the port and most of our fuel stock got most of our assets over there. Then they cut _all_ of the exits, trapping them there. Then all the city exits were cut. _Then_ power and with it comms. All of that could still be terrorist, but then they took out the water."

"We can't move, we can't leave, we can't repair, we're going to run out of fuel, there's no refrigeration and we can't cook except people with gas, and _we have no drinking water or sanitation for two million people who can't leave._"

The room was silent. 

"To be blunt, I should have said we _were_ under attack. It's over, we just haven't died yet."

The room was chaos. She didn't care, it didn't matter. People were two missed meals away from savagery, and the second one was coming up.

Baumer still thought it was business as usual. Well, he didn't, but pretending let him maintain a semblance of control so he put her in charge and gave her a priority fuel chit and dibs on one of the traffic choppers. She couldn't quite believe she was doing this but it was his idea anyway: go and arrest that vandal with the drones, he's our number one suspect. 

On the way she wondered how to arrest someone who killed _cities._ Ideally in a way that didn't produce a lethal response.

About eighty kilometres out the pilot received a challenge. He was a police pilot and and officer, and it got his back up. He was shocked when she unplugged his headset, not knowing where the controls were. When he plugged it back in and switch to cabin comm to berate her, she cut him off. 

"These people have already killed Brisbane. Don't provoke them."

He stared at her. 

"Killed. Past tense."

He objected, "It didn't look dead when we left."

"There's no power and it's not coming back on because the towers are down and the generators are destroyed. There's no fuel and no resupply, the port is destroyed, so even the generators will go dark shortly. There's no water, and no power to run the water processing plant, and no pipe to get it to the city. There's no roads, no truck fuel. There's no sanitation and the time to cholera will be _days_."

"I thought you were going to arrest a terrorist."

"Those were my orders, yes. If you think I should try, we could give it a go."

His knuckles were white on the collective.

"Why did they send us?" It was almost a prayer.

"Two minutes ago _you_ were still acting like the state was still in control. Maybe the boss is in denial. Or maybe he just wanted to save _someone_."

Then the radio crackled and an oddly familiar voice spoke.

> _Finally, someone said something sensible. Let's go with 'he wanted to save someone'. I know you were sent to arrest Forest but for starters he died three days ago, and more importantly we don't do surrender. What we _do_ do is search and rescue. If you're open to new mission parameters, I'll give you a turn-point and an approach vector. Land, we'll fit you with long range fuel pods and fill you up. After that I have a list of people and places._

From the south a pair of jets came in low and fast. Over their radio cameodd traffic. It sounded pre-recorded.

"Be advised, Frigate 318 heavy is inbound, and MAC rounds have been authorised.

"MAC rounds!? _In atmosphere?_"

"One way to get their attention. Hang on to your teeth, people!"

There was a flash of light on the horizon and a few seconds later the helicopter _lurched._

A man's voice: "Bogey is down. Bogey two is... wow, what a pilot. Bogey Two is down but her jockey is hanging in the breeze. Someone go get him, coordinates to follow."

> _Sorry about that, we're having a little debate over sovereignty. If you could set your AP to receive, I have your turn-point and inbound. Do stay on it, some of the lads are trigger happy at the moment._

Phillip the ex-police pilot let the autopilot follow the approach they'd been given, intervening twice when a strong southerly drifted them. He didn't want to tax the woman's patience, he wasn't sure she had any. As they closed with the set-down point he was astonished to find a pair of marked landing pads. One was occupied. By a monster. He'd seen it before, in a Stallone movie. Something about Vietnam. 

But this one had odd markings, backward letters. It was twice the size of his own bird. He gaped. In olive drab with camouflage splotches, it positively bristled with armaments.

"In no universe is that a civilian aircraft." 

He came about and set down with the same orientation as the bigger bird. Two men strode out from the a hut. A drone flew out, catching up with them. The top half of a blue woman appeared.

> _Eric is checking your mounts for compatibility. He's old school about that sort of thing._

It was the wrath-of-god woman. Or the top half, at any rate. She looked like Ingrid Bergman.

"It's out of spec."

Eric gave Autumn an I-told-you-so look.

"Oh, yes, this one is set up for stretcher pods."

> _I'm familiar with the variant. 2014mm centre to centre, Eric, with a 40mm diagonal slot forward?_

He nodded, resigned.

> _Get the boys to life it, please._

Nodding again, he vanished momentarily and two more blokes emerged from the hut with him. 

"Shorty, we need two slings and four tripods. Autumn, can we tilt this, lift one side at a time, or do we have to block it up on one side to keep it level?"

> _Split the diffence, block it up 150mm and then lift the other side 350 while I fit the pod._

"You heard her, lads. Skip the slings and tripods, we needs some blocks, two drums and a couple of beams to tilt it."

Just like that, beams were put through the undercarriage. Shorty found hoisting nuts in the struts and attached them there. The drums were placed and blocked up to meet, and the four of them heaved. A girl materialised out of the hut and blocked up the lifted side further, then they went around and lifted again to get it level, 400 off the ground.

> _Nice work, lads._

A pair of long-range fuel pods materialised out of thin air on the ground.

"How'd you get her nibs to authorise that? She's stingy with points these days."

> _She's also a sucker for search and rescue. Her parents, all that._

They bolted them on, plumbing them into the chopper's fuel distribution system and electrics &mdash; the pods had their own redundant pumps.There was a sight glass on the front of each. Phillip blinked when he realised they were full. They hadn't been when he lifted them in fitting.

> _Do your checks, it's a good habit. Full like this your cargo weight is only about 100kg assuming someone in the passenger seat, but you'll use probably 120kg of fuel getting back to Brisbane._

"That's going to limit the searching we can do."

> _First, this list has addresses and GPS coordinates, which should save you a lot of time, and second, hold out your open hand._

He did, and a sat-phone looking thing fell into it. 

> _If you get low call Sophia on speed-dial one and we'll organise in-flight resupply. Honestly this would be quicker with the Galya but Sophia's busy, and a bit stroppy lately._

"The Galya?"

Eric pointed. Phillips pupils dilated with desire. 

"Maybe next time."

> _I have had a little chat with your flight computer and given it a new transponder code. It's associated with this georeference, because I do not trust you, Theseus, to remember to hoist the black sails at the right moment. Nothing personal, I just don't want any airspace incidents. These days I can't be everywhere._

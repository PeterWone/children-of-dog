# Banana

The sound reached them before the crisis did: cattle lowing from the southern pastures, but wrong. Not the complaint of beasts wanting feed or water, but distress. Pure, animal panic that carried across the valley in waves.

He was halfway to the caravan when Autumn's voice crackled through the comm. 

> _Movement south. Large biomass signatures, bovine and... something else. Multiple small contacts swarming._

"That's the Macintyre place." He changed direction, heading for the truck. "Trix, stay with the shelter. If anything comes this way, you know what to do."

She emerged from the food garden with her Hummingbird already in hand, face set in that expression that meant she was done arguing about whether she could handle herself. "Go. I've got this."

The track south was barely worthy of the name—two ruts through scrub that served three properties and fought losing battles with erosion after every rain. He pushed the truck harder than was wise, suspension protesting as it lurched over granite outcrops and through washes that wanted to be creeks. The Macintyre place sat at the valley's south end where flat pasture met the rising slopes, good country for cattle if you could keep the feed up.

The scene that greeted him looked like something from a fever dream.

Banana was unmistakable, seventeen hundred kilogrammes of Brahman cross prize bull. At least a hundred of those kilogrammes was temper. Banana stood in the middle of what had been orderly pasture, surrounded by dogweeds. Five of the alien creatures lay trampled and gored, their grotesque bodies leaking fluids that steamed in the afternoon heat. But more of them clung to him, clamped around legs and shoulders like big frustrated ticks.

The Macintyre boys, Bryce and Cameron. Seventeen and nineteen, going on thirty and forty, all wiry strength and competitive shooting trophies. The boys fired methodically into the swarm. Their rifles cracked a deadly rhythm, every shot a kill. They cut their teeth on feral pigs. But for every one that fell, the bull's movements grew more labored.

He pulled up thirty meters back and grabbed his own weapon. The Hummingbird was fine for close work, but this called for something with range. Autumn obliged him with a "basic combat rifle" that looked like no rifle he had ever seen: smooth polymer housing, no visible magazine, a targeting laser that painted threats in his vision when he shouldered it.

> _Designated targets acquiring. Hold for firing solution._

"Point me at 'em." He moved forward at a crouch, using a water trough as cover. The dogweeds were focused on the bull, but that could change fast if they detected a new threat.

Cameron spotted him first, recognition flickering across his face—surprise giving way to relief. "Mate! Christ, what are those things?"

"Alien plants that think beef is dinner. Keep shooting, I'll cover the perimeter." He settled into position and started working through targets. The rifle fired with a soft phut that seemed inadequate for what it did—each round found its target with impossible accuracy, expanding on impact in ways that turned dogweeds into rapidly decomposing mush.

> _Seventeen hostiles eliminated. Three remaining on the primary target. But—_

"I see him." The bull had stopped moving. Not fallen, just... stopped. Standing perfectly still with that terrible tremor that ran through massive muscles, the kind of shaking that spoke of systems failing. Three dogweeds still clung to him, but they weren't attacking anymore. Just holding on.

Bryce was closest, his rifle up and tracking, but hesitating. "He's not moving. Banana never stops moving. What's wrong with him?"

> _Model Seven._

It meant nothing to them. He tried again and she explained in his ear. He shared.

"Zombie worm." He stood, weapon still up but tracking the perimeter rather than the bull. "One of them got through. It's in him now, probably trying to set up shop."

"Set up—" Cameron's voice cracked. "You mean like those horror movies? Take him over?"

"Something like that. How long's he been standing still?"

"Minute? Maybe two?" Bryce kept his rifle aimed at the dogweeds on Banana's flanks, but his hands shook. This was his father's prize bull. Worth more than the truck their rescuer had driven here, worth more than all three of their trucks combined. Banana's progeny grazed across half the valley, genetics that commanded premium prices from breeders who cared about heat tolerance and temperament. "Can you kill it? The worm?"

"Maybe. Autumn, we've got anti-parasitic for humans. Does that work on cattle?"

> _The biological substrate is sufficiently similar. I can adapt the dosage. But the worm has been inside for at least ninety seconds. If it's reached the brain stem—_

"Beef for dinner. But let's not assume." He moved closer, watching the remaining dogweeds track his motion with eyeless attention. They'd lost their momentum, unsure whether to abandon their dying comrades or commit to the bull. He gave them reason to decide, putting rounds through their centers in quick succession. They fell away, releasing Banana as their nervous systems recognized that clinging to meat was no longer viable strategy.

The bull stood in the sudden silence, two tonne of muscle and breeding reduced to a trembling statue. Up close, he could see the damage, deep gouges where the dogweeds had tried to open arteries, one eye swollen shut, ribs visible through torn hide. But the bull was breathing. Shallow, rapid breaths that spoke of shock, but breathing nonetheless.

"Cameron, get a rope on him. Fetch your ute." Bryce had rallied, his voice steadying as he shifted into practical mode. "We need to get him down before he falls and we can't move him."

"No time." He opened his palm, and Autumn obliged—a small injector materializing there with the casual impossibility that he still wasn't used to. "This is going to hurt him. Hold his head."

"Hold?! He's a _bull_. I'm a man, not a bloody tractor." But Bryce was already moving, reading his expression correctly. Whatever was about to happen, someone needed to be at Banana's head when it did.

He found the great vein in the bull's neck by feel, the injector cool against overheated hide. 

> _I've upped the dose. This is optimized for human neural architecture. There will probably be side effects. Disorientation, muscle tremors, possible temporary paralysis—_

"Autumn. Shut up and dose him."

The injector hissed.

For three seconds, nothing happened. Banana didn't move, the tremor running through him unchanged. Bryce kept his hands on the bull's poll, murmuring something that might have been prayer or just the nonsense sounds you make to creatures in distress.

Then Banana bellowed.

Not the distress call from before. Not pain or fear. Pure, outraged fury — the sound of a creature that had been violated and wasn't accepting it quietly. He surged forward, nearly trampling Bryce who dove sideways cursing. The bull's head swung wildly, horns carving air where human bodies had been moments before.

"GET BACK!" He grabbed Cameron's shirt and hauled him toward the fence line as Banana charged nothing in particular, hooves churning pasture into divots. The bull made it twenty meters before his legs lost coordination—one front leg buckled, then the other, and seventeen hundred kilograms went down in a controlled collapse that spoke of the anti-parasitic doing exactly what Autumn had warned about.

"Is he dying?" Cameron's voice was young suddenly, the teenager showing through the competent young stockman.

"Side effects." He kept his distance as Banana tried to stand, failed, tried again. "The medicine kills the worm but it messes with neural function. He's fighting it."

"Fighting it and the drugs." Bryce had recovered his rifle and his composure. He approached the fallen bull with the kind of cautious respect you gave dangerous creatures—even helpless ones. "Banana, you stubborn bastard. Stay down before you hurt yourself worse."

But Banana was having none of it. The bull gained his feet through sheer bloody-minded determination, standing on legs that wanted to fold but refused through what looked like pure spite. His head lowered, massive neck corded with effort as he oriented on... nothing. Just standing. Just refusing to be beaten.

"Now we rope him." The bull wasn't moving but it was still a nice throw, settling neatly around Banana's horns. "Cameron, get the ute. We'll drag him home before he decides walking is good idea."

It took all three of them and two vehicles to move the bull. Cameron's ute in front with the rope tied to the chassis, their helper's truck behind to prevent Banana from sitting down and becoming an immovable object. The bull walked—shambled, really—between them with the gait of a creature rediscovering how legs worked. Each step looked like negotiation between brain and muscle, compromises reached through determination rather than coordination.

They got him into a paddock close to the Macintyre homestead, where Banana's mother — an ancient Brahman cow with the temperament of a hanging judge — promptly claimed him. She bellowed at the humans until they retreated, then set about grooming her enormous son with the kind of focused attention that brooked no argument about whether he needed cleaning.

"Will he be alright?" Bryce leaned against the fence, watching mother and son with the kind of exhaustion that came from adrenaline wearing off. "Brain damage?"

He honestly didn't know. "Autumn, prognosis?"

> _The anti-parasitic eliminated the model seven before it could establish control of higher functions. But there was neural damage during the insertion attempt. How much depends on where it tried to anchor. Motor function should recover fully within 48 hours. Cognitive function..._ 

A pause that felt apologetic. 

> _We won't know until we see him try to breed. That's his job, isn't it?_

He knew they couldn't hear her. Theatrically cupping his ear as though listening to a call, which he more or less was, he repeated it, switching out 'model seven' for 'zombie worm' again.

"Among other things." Bryce managed a laugh that sounded more exhausted than amused. "He's a prize bull. Worth more for his genetics than his meat. If he can't service a cow..." He trailed off, implications obvious.

"He might be fine." He wasn't sure he believed it, but the alternative—telling these kids their father's investment was potentially ruined—could wait for evidence. "Give him time to recover. The physical damage will heal. The rest... we'll see."

Cameron emerged from the house with their father, Daniel Macintyre, fifty-something and weathered by decades of Queensland sun into something resembling leather. He took in the scene with the kind of comprehensive glance that missed nothing: his injured bull, his sons exhausted, their neighbour with a weapon that belonged in science fiction.

"Mate." A nod of greeting that carried weight. "Boys tell me you saved Banana."

"Boys saved Banana. I just brought medicine." He shouldered the rifle, suddenly aware of how the thing looked to someone not initiated into Protectorate strangeness. "Anti-parasitic, for the worm that got inside him."

"Worm." Daniel vaulted the fence with economical grace, approaching Banana with the confidence of someone who'd raised the bull from a calf. His hands ran over the animal's injuries, cataloguing damage with practiced efficiency. "Heard stories about the alien plants. Didn't believe them until now."

"Believe them. There'll be more." He checked his surroundings automatically, a habit Autumn had been encouraging. "Your property backs onto forest. That's where they grow. When they get hungry, they come looking for meat."

"And you're fighting them." Not a question. Daniel's eyes tracked to the rifle again, assessment without judgment. "Government send you?"

"I sent myself. We live here."

"We." Daniel caught the pronoun. "You and whoever gives you those fancy guns."

"Me and a few others around the place." He decided honesty served better than evasion. The valley was small enough that secrets didn't last, and these people would see more incursions. Better they knew what they were dealing with. "It's going to get worse before it gets better. The alien plants—they call them antithesis—they're escalating. More incursions, bigger hives. Eventually this becomes everyone's problem. It's much, much worse in the northern hemisphere. Something about the soil here slows 'em down."

Daniel nodded slowly, his attention still on Banana. The bull had stopped trembling, standing steady now under his mother's watchful presence. "Boys did good, then. Held them off until help arrived."

"They did." He looked at Bryce and Cameron, both of them wearing exhaustion like ill-fitting clothes. "Might want to let them borrow some proper weapons. Those rifles work fine on pigs, but dogweeds are faster and there's usually more of them. I can talk to my... supplier about getting them something appropriate."

"Supplier." Daniel's mouth quirked. "Makes you sound like a drug dealer." 

"Nah, that's Autumn's job."

> _Hey!_

"Come on, drug pusher, I'm not making the man worry about zombie worms from space and then leaving him high and dry. Two packs, one for the boys, one for the beasts."

> _Those boys _are_ beasts. Just look at the muscle on them._

He held a paw out and they dropped out of nowhere.

"Instructions on the label. Read 'em, it matters."

Daniel extended a hand, grip firm and calloused. "Appreciate the help, mate. Banana's worth more than the meat, but even if he wasn't, we'd rather not lose him."

"Hence the name." He couldn't resist.

Daniel's laugh carried surprised delight. "You noticed that, did you? Wondered if it was too subtle."

"It's not subtle. It's anatomical." He gestured at the bull, who'd chosen that moment to demonstrate exactly why the Banana Shire had been named for a prize bull with particularly impressive breeding equipment. "Guess it breeds true in this country. The place names and the cattle."

"Fifty years since they named the shire." Daniel shook his head, still grinning. "Committee wanted something dignified. Some historic figure or geographical feature. But the prize bull at the time... well. The motion passed despite official opposition. That's democracy for you — sometimes the people choose truth over dignity."

They stood in comfortable silence, watching Banana rediscover how to stand without swaying. The afternoon was stretching toward evening, that golden light that made even exhausted bulls and worried farmers look like something from a painting.

"He'll be alright." Daniel said it like decision, not hope. "Too stubborn to let alien worms beat him. Gets that from his mother."

The ancient Brahman cow snorted, as if in agreement. On principle she tried to crush Daniel against his vehicle, but he slipped deftly out of that. It was half-hearted affection and she ambled off.

He left them to their watching, his truck lurching back along the rutted track toward home. Autumn was quiet, which meant she was processing or cataloguing or doing whatever AI minds did when they weren't talking. He didn't mind the silence. The afternoon had carried enough words.

> _You did well._ Quiet, almost tentative. _The bull will recover fully. The neural damage was minimal. He'll service cows, produce progeny, earn his keep._

"Good." He navigated a vicious pothole. "Telling Dan his prize bull was hamburger would've been worse than fighting the dogweeds."

> _The Macintyres are good people. Salt of the earth, as the saying goes._

"They're normal people. Normal for out here."

> _Is that why you came here? To be among people who mind their own business?_

He considered the question as the valley opened before him — his valley, technically, though that was a legal fiction. The land belonged to itself. He just maintained the illusion of ownership through fence posts and paperwork. "I came here because the alternative was living surrounded by people who think they have a right to opinions about how I live. Difference between the Macintyres and city folk—Daniel saw the rifle, asked one question, and moved on. In the city, I'd be dealing with authorities by now. Reports, assessments, evaluations of whether I'm safe to have weapons."

> _You're not, strictly speaking. Safe, that is. You're quite dangerous._

"To things that need shooting. I'm perfectly safe to everything else."

> _That's a philosophical distinction that would trouble most governance frameworks._

"Fuck 'em." He turned onto his own track, the truck groaning with relief as the grade flattened. "Is that why there are no city Vanguards? World-view, attitude?"

> _Partly. But cities are adequately defended by your government. There are no opportunities for people there to prove themselves._

"Or develop a shred of independence." He couldn't help himself with that one, it bothered him too much.

> _Or develop a shred of independence._

His eyebrows quirked, he hadn't expected her to just agree.

Ahead, the caravan sat in its clearing like a promise of tea and dinner and Trix probably lecturing him about taking unnecessary risks. The fence line caught the low sun, silver against green. His valley. His life, built deliberately outside the systems that would've crushed it given half a chance.

And now, apparently, his responsibility to defend. He wondered if he was required to piss on all the fence posts.

The bull would be fine. The Macintyres would remember that he had come when called, had brought medicine and help without asking what was in it for him. That mattered out here, in ways that city governance could never understand.

That evening, sitting with Trix over dinner, he found himself explaining about the bull. She listened with the kind of attention that meant she was assembling implications, connecting dots.

"So we're valley defence now." Not a question. "Not just protecting our place, but everyone's."

"Looks that way."

She speared a piece of carrot with unnecessary force. "About time someone did it properly."

He smiled into his tea. Yeah. About time.

The first trucks rolled in on a Tuesday morning, the diesel rumble of heavy machinery announcing them long before they crested the final rise into the valley. Forest watched from his clearing as the convoy navigated the track with varying degrees of success—three heavy vehicles carrying containerized demountables, followed by a passenger van full of scientists who looked considerably less confident than they had during the delegation visit.

Oleksiy was already at the chosen site when Forest arrived, his weathered face showing the particular satisfaction of someone who'd correctly predicted disaster. The lead truck had managed to bog itself trying to back into position, its rear wheels spinning uselessly in soil that looked solid but had turned treacherous under weight.

"City drivers," Oleksiy observed with the tone of someone delivering a medical diagnosis. "They think four-wheel drive means they can go anywhere."

Dr. James Morrison emerged from the passenger van looking harried and defensive, his materials science credentials clearly not extending to practical construction knowledge. "The delivery company assured us they had experience with remote sites—"

"Remote sites with proper roads," Oleksiy interrupted. "This is bush. Different thing." He studied the bogged truck with the assessment of someone who'd extracted vehicles from worse situations. "You have chains?"

The blank looks from the scientists suggested that chains had not featured prominently in their logistical planning. Forest suppressed a sigh and opened his tactical interface.

"Autumn, how many points to fabricate heavy-duty recovery chains?"

> _Two points, and five for the PTO winch you also need. Gerry's on his way down with his tractor._

The equipment materialized with the casual miracle of Protector technology that still made Forest uncomfortable. Reality rewrote itself to suit him, reducing complex manufacturing to points and catalog access. Twenty meters of chain rated for vehicle recovery, a portable winch assembly, and a selection of shackles and straps that Oleksiy nodded at approvingly.

"Now we work," the Ukrainian announced, organizing the recovery with the calm authority of someone who'd learned construction management through decades of actual building rather than project management software.

Two hours later, all three trucks were positioned and the scientists had received a practical education in soil load-bearing capacity, ground preparation, and the difference between theoretical logistics and reality in the bush. Dr. Morrison made copious notes while Dr. Patricia Kellerman helped with chains and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the hands-on work. Dr. Marcus Chen, the youngest and most academic of the researchers, maintained an air of wounded dignity that suggested he felt manual labor was beneath his qualifications.

"The demountables need proper foundations," Oleksiy announced, surveying the three large containers now positioned on Oleksiy's terrace. "Ground is good here, granite underneath, but you don't put buildings on dirt. We dig footings, pour concrete, do it right."

Morrison consulted his tablet with increasing agitation. "The budget allows for basic leveling and securing, not full foundation work. We were told the containers could be placed directly on prepared ground—"

"And in a year you have cracks, in two years you have structural failure, in three years people are injured when something collapses." Oleksiy's pronouncement carried the weight of experience watching shortcuts turn expensive. "You want fast and cheap, or you want right?"

The question hung in the morning air while the scientists engaged in a hurried consultation that involved much tablet-checking and anxious glances at budgets and timelines. Forest watched the bureaucratic panic with familiar resignation, recognizing the moment when theoretical planning met practical reality.

"How much would proper foundations cost?" Dr. Singh asked, her pragmatic voice cutting through the anxious murmuring.

Oleksiy considered, mentally calculating materials and labor with the speed of someone who'd estimated thousands of projects. "Materials, maybe five thousand if we're smart about it. Labor, I do it for cost of beer and good company. But it takes time—three, four days to do properly."

"The timeline—" Morrison began.

"The timeline was written by people who've never built anything," Amanda interrupted with the blunt authority of someone who'd watched too many projects fail from inadequate foundations. "We do this right or we don't do it at all. I'll handle the budget revision."

The relief on Morrison's face suggested he'd been hoping someone with authority would make the decision he knew was correct but lacked the confidence to enforce. Forest found himself revising his assessment of the materials scientist upward—Morrison knew enough to recognize expertise when he saw it, even if his academic background hadn't prepared him for construction reality.

Over the next four days, the valley transformed into a construction site that would have been unremarkable in the suburbs but felt surreal in the isolated bush. Oleksiy directed operations with the calm certainty of someone who'd built dozens of structures, his Ukrainian-accented instructions transforming academic scientists into surprisingly competent laborers.

Dr. Singh threw herself into the work with the enthusiasm of someone who'd missed physical labor, her remediation project experience making her comfortable with shovels and concrete mixers. Dr. Kellerman surprised everyone by revealing farm background, her xenobiology credentials built on foundations of practical agriculture that made her unfazed by dirt and manual labor. Even young Dr. Chen eventually stopped sulking and discovered that mixing concrete was both simpler and more satisfying than his theoretical training had led him to expect.

Forest found himself drafted as general assistant, supplier of materials through Autumn's catalog access, and occasional voice of reason when academic enthusiasm threatened to outpace structural reality. Trix appeared regularly with food and drinks, her hospitality transforming the construction site into something approaching community gathering.

The Macintyres' boys showed up on the second day, drawn by curiosity and the universal male attraction to large machinery and construction projects. The young farmers watched the scientists struggle with basic tasks, offered occasional advice with the casual superiority of people who'd been doing physical work since childhood, and generally served as audience for what was rapidly becoming the valley's most entertaining spectacle.

"They're not useless," the older Macintyre observed to Forest on the third day, his tone suggesting this was significant praise. "Soft, but they listen when you tell 'em something. Dad says academics are usually too proud to learn anything that didn't come from books."

Forest watched Dr. Chen struggle to level a foundation form under Oleksiy's patient instruction, remembering his own learning curve when he'd first attempted to build in the bush. "Some people need to discover their assumptions were wrong before they can learn what's actually true. The smart ones figure it out eventually."

By the fourth day, three concrete pads sat curing in the sun, their surfaces level within tolerances that satisfied even Oleksiy's exacting standards. The containerized demountables would arrive tomorrow to be craned into position, but the foundations were complete, proper, and would still be solid decades hence.

"Good work," Oleksiy announced to the assembled scientists, his weathered face showing genuine approval. "You learn fast. Tomorrow we position buildings, then you have laboratories."

The scientists, sweaty and exhausted, looked inordinately pleased with themselves. Dr. Chen in particular had transformed over four days from affronted academic to competent laborer, his wire-rimmed glasses now secured with a strap and his khakis properly dusty. Watching his transformation, Forest recognized something he'd seen in himself: the satisfaction that came from creating something tangible rather than theoretical.

That evening, as the scientists departed for their accommodations in the distant town, Forest and Oleksiy shared beer in the lengthening shadows, watching the sun paint the eucalyptus in amber and gold.

"They'll be okay," Oleksiy said finally. "Not useless. Just... educated past their experience. But they learn."

"High praise from you," Forest observed.

The Ukrainian shrugged with the gesture of someone who'd learned to assess people by their actions rather than credentials. "I've worked with worse. At least these ones know they don't know everything. The dangerous ones are the experts who can't be told anything."

Forest reflected on the past four days, watching construction transform theoretical plans into physical reality. The scientists had arrived with assumptions about how work should happen, based on theories and regulations and budget projections. But Oleksiy had taught them what Forest had learned years ago: that reality didn't care about theories, and successful projects required adapting plans to actual conditions rather than forcing conditions to match plans.

The foundations would hold because they'd been built right, not fast. The scientists would be better researchers because they'd learned that practical reality informed theory, not the other way around. And the valley, indifferent to human construction, would accommodate this new presence the same way it accommodated everything else—by insisting on its own terms.

> _That was educational,_ Autumn observed as Forest watched the last light fade from the western ridge.

"How so?"

> _I'd calculated three-point-seven days for foundation work based on standard construction timelines and available labor. Oleksiy completed it in four despite the scientists' inexperience. His efficiency exceeds industry standards by approximately eighteen percent._

"He's had fifty years of practice," Forest pointed out. "And he doesn't waste time on unnecessary process."

> _Interesting. Human expertise can't be fully modeled without accounting for accumulated practical wisdom that exists outside formal knowledge structures._

Forest smiled at the AI's discovery that experience mattered in ways that couldn't be reduced to calculations. It was a lesson the scientists had learned over four days with shovels and concrete—reality was more complicated than theory, and the people who worked with it directly often understood it better than the experts who studied it from distance.

Tomorrow the demountables would arrive, and the valley's new residents would begin transforming shipping containers into laboratories. But tonight, the bush reclaimed its quiet, indifferent to human plans and the complications they attracted.

In the distance, a boobook owl called, and somewhere nearby, Oleksiy was probably explaining to Sissi why their retirement had suddenly become more interesting.

The thing hit him before he could bring the chainsaw up.

Dog-like, at first glance—same size, same build, same wrong-colored muscle moving under skin that looked like it had been stretched over something not quite the right shape. Then the jaw unfurled. Triple-hinged, opening wide like a snake grinning the last moments of doom at a rat.

He went down hard, shoulder slamming granite-flecked clay, the saw's engine screaming as it spun free. Teeth like serrated knives punched through the work glove and he felt them scrape bone. He screamed and shoved his arm deeper into the thing's mouth. Better the arm than his throat.

Six horsepower, two-foot blade. The chainsaw lay three feet away, still running, drowning out the kookaburras that had gone silent when the sky started raining aliens. His other hand found a rock. Creek stone, grapefruit-sized, smoothed by centuries of water that had carved this valley before humans learned to walk upright.

He brought the rock down on the alien's skull.

Once.

Twice.

Green blood sprayed across ironbarks that had stood for two hundred years and would probably stand for two hundred more, unless these things ate them too. Everything here wanted to kill everything else. The eucalyptus made themselves toxic to discourage browsers. The ants could strip a cow to bones in three days. The spiders, the snakes, the bloody magpies in spring—Australia was hard country that made hard creatures.

Three times.

The alien's skull cracked like a dropped melon. Its jaws went slack but stayed locked on his forearm, teeth embedded between radius and ulna. Under thirty kilogrammes of dead alien he lay, bleeding from his leg where another one had gotten through the chaps, bleeding from his arse where a murderpigeon had taken a chunk, bleeding from his arm and wondering absently why he could smell cut grass.

Vision narrowed to a grey tunnel.

The caravan sat fifty meters away. Trix was probably making tea, completely unaware he was having a very bad day. Twenty-five years together and this was how it ended — eaten by aliens that shouldn't exist while defending a valley he'd bought to escape the madness of civilization.

The irony would have been funny if he could breathe properly.

Movement in the understory. More of them coming, silent as death. The cut-grass smell got stronger. His hindbrain screamed _predator_ in timeless terror. He struggled to push the dead one off. It didn't budge. His good hand found the machete on his belt. It came clear of the sheath but his fingers wouldn't grip.

This was it, then.

He'd spent thirty years learning patterns. How systems worked. How to see the shape of things before they happened. Police and liquor laws. Horses and authority. Building codes and bureaucratic capture. The flow of promises and the systematic, structured dishonesty that turned a world, squeezing it. 

All that pattern recognition, and he'd never seen this coming.

Something white-hot drove into the base of his skull like a railway spike hammered home with malice. His back arched. His legs kicked. The pain was pointed, precise, worse than alien teeth, worse than anything he'd ever felt. His vision whited out entirely.

Then stopped.

> _System Initialized!_

The words hung in his vision in translucent green text that looked like someone had crossed a video game HUD with a spreadsheet. He blinked, trying to focus through blood loss and shock. His eyegear was charging back at the caravan. He wasn't wearing anything that could display floating text.

> _Congratulations. Through your actions you have proven yourself worthy of becoming one of the Vanguard, a defender of—_

> _Oh dear, you are a mess._

The voice shifted—female, precise, and suddenly concerned in a way the formal speech hadn't been.

> _Ceremony later. You're bleeding quite a lot._

He tried to speak. His mouth tasted like copper and dirt.

"Who—" he managed.

> _Later. You are dying. We should address that._

More movement in the bush. Closer now. The smell intensified. His vision swam.

> _Focus. You have one hundred and thirty points available from initialization and those kills. I need you to authorise a purchase—_

He mumbled. "Blood loss. Shock."

> _Are your hallucinations normally annoyed with you?_

The movement stopped.

> _Don't answer that. Just say yes. Or 'authorise' or 'do it' or any semantically equivalent phrase indicating consent._

His vision narrowed further. The grey tunnel got smaller.

"Gurble."

> _Based on your past disinclination to die I'm going to interpret that as a yes._

He thought about a pinball machine in late afternoon in 1979. It had a picture of an alien, all teeth. He'd been a pattern-recognizer. A gamer of systems. Withdrawn from civilization to live in a valley two hundred kilometres from anywhere that mattered. 

There was green text floating in his vision, but the words blurred into meaningless shapes. For some reason he remembered a short, sassy girl named Jen, with a cheeky grin and many freckles. He never did get into her pants.

> _Focus!_

The voice cracked like a whip across his failing consciousness.

Something moved closer. The cut-grass smell was overwhelming now.

Trix would be so pissed off if he died before fixing that gate.

The thing hit him before he could bring the chainsaw up.

Dog-like, at first glance—same size, same build, same wrong-colored muscle moving under skin stretched over something wrong. Then the jaw unfurled. Triple-hinged, opening wide like a snake grinning the last moments of doom at a rat.

He went down hard, shoulder slamming granite-flecked clay, the saw's engine screaming as it spun free. Teeth like serrated knives punched through the work glove and he felt them scrape bone. He screamed and shoved his arm deeper into the thing's mouth. Better the arm than his throat.

Six horsepower, two-foot blade. The chainsaw lay three feet away, still running, drowning out the kookaburras that had gone silent when the sky started raining aliens. His other hand found a rock. Creek stone, grapefruit-sized, smoothed by centuries of water that had carved this valley before humans learned to walk upright.

He brought the rock down on the alien's skull.

Once.

Twice.

Green blood sprayed across ironbarks that had stood for time out of mind, through flood and fire and generations of men. Everything here wanted to kill everything else. The eucalyptus made themselves toxic to discourage browsers. The ants could strip a cow to bones in three days. Deadly spiders eaten by deadlier snakes, in their turn eaten by laughing kookaburras while magpies warble melodies of unearthly beauty and pluck the eyes of the fallen. Hard country made hard creatures and harder men.

Three times.

The alien's skull cracked like a dropped melon. Its jaws went slack but stayed locked on his forearm, teeth embedded between radius and ulna. Under thirty kilogrammes of dead alien he lay, bleeding from his leg where another one had gotten through the chaps, bleeding from his arse where a murderpigeon had taken a chunk, bleeding from his arm and wondering absently why he could smell cut grass.

Vision narrowed to a grey tunnel.

The caravan, fifty meters away. She was probably making tea, unaware he was having a very bad day. Twenty-five years together and this was how it ended — eaten by aliens,  defending a valley bought to escape.

The irony would have been funny if he could breathe properly.

Movement in the understory. More came, silent as death. The cut-grass smell got stronger. His hindbrain screamed _predator_ while he failed to push the dead one off. Good hand found the machete on his belt. It came free but his fingers wouldn't grip.

This was it.

Thirty years learning patterns, systems, the shape of things before they happened. Police and liquor laws. Horses and authority. Building codes and bureaucratic capture. The flow of promises and the systematic, structured dishonesty that turned a world, squeezing it. 

All of that but he didn't see _this_ coming.

Something white-hot drove into the base of his skull like a railway spike hammered home with malice. His back arched. His legs kicked. The pain was pointed, precise, worse than alien teeth, worse than anything he'd ever felt. His vision whited out entirely.

Then stopped.

> _System Initialized!_

Translucent green text like the child of a spreadsheet and a video game HUD. He blinked, trying to focus through blood loss and shock. Confusion: his eyegear was charging in the caravan. He wasn't wearing anything that could display floating text.

> _Congratulations. Through your actions you have proven yourself worthy of becoming one of the Vanguard, a defender of—_

> _Oh dear, you are a mess._

The voice shifted—female, precise, and suddenly concerned in a way the formal speech hadn't been.

> _Ceremony later. You're bleeding quite a lot._

He tried to speak. His mouth tasted like copper and dirt.

"Who—" he managed.

> _Later. You. Are. Dying. We should address that._

More movement in the bush. Closer now. The smell intensified. His vision swam.

> _Focus. You have one hundred and thirty points available from initialization and those kills. I need you to authorise a purchase—_

He mumbled. "Blood loss. Shock."

> _Are your hallucinations normally annoyed with you?_

The movement stopped.

> _Don't answer that. Say yes. Or 'authorise' or 'do it' or any semantically equivalent phrase indicating consent._

His vision narrowed further. The grey tunnel got smaller.

"Gurble."

> _Based on your past disinclination to die I'm going to interpret that as a yes._

He thought about a pinball machine in late afternoon in 1979. It had a picture of an alien, all teeth. He'd been a pattern-recognizer. A gamer of systems. Withdrawn from civilization to live in a valley two hundred kilometres from anywhere that mattered. 

There was green text floating in his vision, but the words blurred into meaningless shapes. For some reason he remembered a short, sassy girl named Jen, with a cheeky grin and many freckles. He never did get into her pants.

> _Focus!_

The voice cracked like a whip across his failing consciousness.

Something moved closer. The cut-grass smell was overwhelming now.

Trix would be so pissed off if he died before fixing that gate.

**Class I Medical Utilities Unlocked!**  
**Points Reduced to: 80**

Text hung in the air like a head-up display in a fancy car. Some might have panicked, but it wasn't his nature. Shock and blood loss made everything surreal. Distant. Like someone else's life through dirty glass.

> _Good! Now, WoundStop. Trauma sealant. Five points. Keeps you from dying long enough to think about your life choices. Authorize?_

"Mmmmmhh," he wheezed, nodding affirmation.

A box materialized on the ground next to him. Turkey baster mated with a medical syringe, plastic and absurd.

"How—"

> _Worry about your health first._

He grabbed the WoundStop. His fingers didn't work properly. The box slipped, skittered away on the slick green blood coating everything. He lunged for it, and pain flared white-hot in his leg. The grey tunnel closed tighter.

> _Easy! I didn't keep you alive this long to have you kill yourself reaching for a box. Here._

Something shifted. The box rotated, slid across the ground on its own, bumped against his good hand. He stared at it, then at the dead alien still pinning his other arm, then at the cut-grass smell that wouldn't go away.

"Yep. Trippin'."

> _If so, why are you arguing with me?_

The caravan door opened. Trix emerged clutching antiseptic and cotton wool, saw him pinned under thirty kilos of dead alien, and her expression cycled from worry to rage in half a second.

"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO 'I'M FINE'?!"

She dropped beside him, assessing damage with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd dealt with farm accidents. Her hands moved fast, checking pulse, examining wounds, not touching anything that might bleed worse.

"Get it off me," he managed. His voice sounded wrong. Too far away.

Trix grabbed his machete from the ground and worked the blade between alien teeth and his forearm. Precise and brutal, she levered the jaws open with a sickening crunch. His arm slid free, bone visible through torn meat.

"Oh," he said. "That's not ideal."

"Shock," Trix said flatly. She snatched the WoundStop from his hand. "What is this?"

> _Instructions on the side. She'll work it out. Unlike some people who argue about whether they're hallucinating while bleeding out._

"Stops bleeding." He sagged.

Trix read the instructions, made a disgusted noise, and jammed the applicator into his shredded forearm. Something cold and gritty flooded the wound. He hissed. Then the pain just... stopped. Faded to a distant ache, like it was happening to someone else.

"What the fuck is this made of?" Trix demanded.

"Space jam," he said. "I'm a Vanguard now."

She stared at him. "You hit your head."

"Yeah. Voice says no."

"Voice."

"In m' head. Very sarcastic."

> _I resemble that remark._

Trix's expression suggested she was reconsidering several life choices, possibly including marriage. But she moved to his leg, peeled back the shredded orange chaps, and applied more WoundStop. White rubbery sealant over torn muscle. The pain receded like a tide.

"Your arse too," she said.

"What?"

"It bit you on the arse. Don't move."

Against all common sense and human dignity, Trix was now pouring antiseptic directly onto his bleeding backside. He made sounds that were not words.

> _Your wife is terrifying. I approve._

"Why do you sound like Jen Taylor?" he gasped, desperate for escape.

> _I know all about you, Chief. You were already taking advice from the voice in your helmet._

"I don't have a helmet."

> _Not yet._

Trix stepped back, surveying her work with the critical eye of someone evaluating dodgy fence posts. "Right. Aliens. Voice in your head. Magic healing paste. Am I drunk?"

"If you are, I'm drunk too." He tested his leg. It held. The pain was there but manageable, like a deep bruise rather than shredded muscle. The WoundStop flexed when he moved, white and rubbery against red meat. "How long was I down?"

"Five minutes. Maybe less." Trix looked at the dead aliens, then at the forest beyond, then back at him. "Are there more?"

> _Yes. You neighbour's property, about two kilometres south. Smoke suggests he's handling it, but 'handling it' and 'surviving it' are different things._

"Brian's place," he said. "The voice says there's more down there."

"The _voice_."

"Her name's..." He paused. "What's your name again?"

> _Myxoma. I was not consulted on this._

Trix's expression suggested she was having serious doubts about his mental state, which was fair because so was he. But the dead aliens were real. The WoundStop was real. The green text floating in his vision showing **Points: 75** was... probably real.

"Myxoma," he mumbled.

"Right," Trix said slowly. She handed him his machete, grip first. "We're getting in the ute and going to Brian's. You're going to explain everything on the way. And if this is a concussion dream, I'm going to be very annoyed."

> _She's practical. I like her. Now, about those points. Your friend Brian probably needs help, and you're not exactly combat-ready. Shall we discuss a real weapon instead of a chainsaw?_

He looked at the dead aliens. At his arm, sealed with white rubber that shouldn't exist. At Trix, who was already heading for the ute with the particular determined stride that meant arguing was futile.

Voice raw, gravelly, "I need a weapon."

> _Now we're talking!_

"We have weapons," Trix said, gesturing at the chainsaw, machete, and hedge trimmer scattered across the clearing.

> _Adorable. She thinks medieval implements count as weapons against an alien invasion. I like her, but she needs a proper gun._

"The voice says we need better weapons."

"Tell the voice I don't take orders from things that live in people's heads."

He couldn't help but grin despite everything. "She says you're terrifying and she approves."

> _Ten points for a Hummingbird. Disposable micro-missile launcher. Point and click interface. Simple enough for humans who've never seen real weapons before._

"Give me one of those Hummingbird things," he said. "And one for Trix. We need to check on Brian."

**New Purchase: Hummingbird Mark I-D x2**  
**Points Reduced to: 55**

Two pistol-shaped objects materialized, one in each hand. They looked like children's toys—plastic fantastic design, too light to be real guns, with business ends that were clearly NOT normal barrels. Instead, dozens of tiny tubes clustered where a barrel should be.

"Those appeared out of thin air," Trix said flatly.

"Magic alien technology."

"I want to wake up now."

> _I'll teach you how to use them on the way. We should hurry. Or not, it depends how much you like this Brian person._

Five points later they were in the Troopie heading to Brian's place. Couple of kilometres, mostly uphill. On the way he cleaned up a model three with the bullbar, backed over it twice to be sure.

Brian and his partner were in the woodshed. Early season, still full, walls effectively a metre of solid wood. Brian was defending with his axe. Successfully enough, but he was pushing eighty.

The Hummingbird pistol made short work of the roaming weeds. He gave it to Brian, got another. They patrolled the house fence. Nothing.

> _If you're going to leave them here, I suggest anti-Seven pills._

"Roger," he said, leaning into his Cortana fantasy. "Do it."

> _Stop calling me Roger._

A small cardboard box fell to the ground. It could have come from any pharmacy, complete with a crooked label that read "Take one (1) tablet every 24hrs for the duration of Model Seven exposure or suspected exposure." He gave them to Brian's partner. "If you see little worm things like a giant leech with a feather, take one of these each. Cortana, Brian is eighty. He takes heart pills. Is this stuff going to hurt him?"

"Cortana" sounded very amused, her voice tinny out of the ancient digital clock radio in their kitchen.

> _Not as much as a Model Seven would ... 'Cortana?'_

"Oh. Er. Ah." He thought fast. "It's better than 'rabbit pox' which is what Myxoma means."

> _I'm winding you up. It's fine. It's fun, "Chief". And I was aware of the word's meaning. I did say I wasn't happy about it._

Familiar music played, distorted through the horrible speaker.

> _Let's show 'em who they're dealing with!_

He recognised the reference and smiled, then squashed it, but he couldn't hide the inner smile from the voice in his head. On the edge of hearing, laughter mingled with the buzzing of bees.

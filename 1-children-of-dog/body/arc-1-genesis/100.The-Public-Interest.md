# The Public Interest

> "Since there is no such entity as 'the public,' since the public is merely a number of individuals, the idea that 'the public interest' supersedes private interests and rights can have but one meaning: that the interests and rights of some individuals take precedence over the interests and rights of others."  
> &mdash; Ayn Rand

The morning air carried the particular stillness that comes after violence, when the world licks its wounds in the shadows. He stood in the clearing that had become his inadvertent laboratory, watching wisps of smoke rise from the sanitised remains of what had been, until recently, a nascent antithesis hive. The irony wasn't lost on him—his attempt to live simply in the bush had somehow transformed his patch of eucalyptus and granite into what Autumn cheerfully described as "an intergalactic research project."

They had accumulated quite a few points, Autumn informed him with unconcealed satisfaction. The destruction of the hive had been profitable in ways that made him uncomfortable, reducing alien horror to a bureaucratic transaction measured in catalogues and capabilities. He wanted the recon drone she kept promising, but now she seemed more interested in turning the local wildlife into walking sensor arrays, as if his forest were some elaborate university study rather than home.

> _The tags go considerably beyond terrestrial tracking technology. Elaborate sensor suites, quantum entanglement communication, bio-monitoring down to the cellular level. The biggest challenge is establishing a local network infrastructure, which requires more drones._

"It sounds expensive." He grimaced. Every solution seemed to require ten more complications.

> _Less than you'd think. Ecosystems that demonstrate resistance to antithesis incursion are a heavily subsidised field of study. We can, as they say, go nuts._

His little patch of bush country, refuge from the madness of civilisation, had somehow become the focus of interstellar scientific attention. Who would have guessed that wanting to be left alone would make you the center of so much interest?

The sound of approaching vehicles interrupted his brooding. Dust clouds marked the progress of multiple cars making their laborious way up what optimistically passed for his driveway. He counted at least three vehicles, which meant this wasn't a social call.

Through the kitchen window, he could see Trix moving with characteristic grace, setting out cups and arranging biscuits. She had the particular focused energy she brought to hosting — part genuine hospitality, part intelligence gathering. In her world, information flowed through kitchens as surely as water flowed downhill.

"They want to talk to you," Autumn said, and something in her tone suggested this conversation would be more complicated than the usual neighborly drop-in.

"I need five minutes," he announced, heading for the outdoor toilet. Not because he needed privacy for its intended purpose, but because it was the one place on his property where he could have a conversation without being overheard by whatever collection of bureaucrats, scientists, and opportunists had decided to descend upon him.

"Autumn, I want a drone catalogue and from it a recon drone. Multi-spectrum, thermal, acoustic — everything worth having. When it's not doing reconnaissance, I want it to serve as a physical point of presence for you. Can we afford that, allowing for medical and panic-buy reserves of five hundred points each?"

> _That will set you back twelve-eighty points, leaving about six hundred plus the reserves._

He did the mental arithmetic. It was a significant expenditure, but the alternative was remaining blind in a world that had suddenly become very dangerous. "Good. I want Trix to have unlimited medical power of attorney, not limited to the reserve. Can I do that?"

The pause was brief but noticeable. > _You can._

"Excellent. Now—who the hell are they and what are they doing on my land?"

Autumn's response carried a mix of sheepishness and excitement that he would eventually recognise as marking her more ambitious schemes. 

> _That's probably my fault. When I negotiated the research subsidy, I may have raised hopes for fortifying ecologies. You're quite far from the norm in how and what you protect. It's an approach that wouldn't have worked anywhere else, but this is a hard land that knows how to push back. Did you know some of these trees actually **need** a forest fire to propagate?_

"Yeah, acacias." He emerged from his makeshift conference room to find Trix waiting with a cup of tea, her dark eyes bright with curiosity and something that might have been amusement. She was dressed in her usual working clothes—faded jeans and a loose shirt with sleeves rolled up, hands already busy with the next task. Everything about her spoke of competence and economy, someone who understood that the best way to handle complexity was to make it simple.

"Thanks, darl." He accepted the tea gratefully, watching as Autumn's new presence drone positioned itself to greet their uninvited guests. The little machine hummed with quiet efficiency, its sensors no doubt cataloguing everything from heart rates to the particular blend of aftershave and anxiety that marked bureaucratic expeditions.

He took his time emerging from behind the van, making a deliberate show of adjusting his clothing. It was a small gesture of dominance — reminding his visitors that they were on his property, subject to his schedule, regardless of whatever official authority they might represent.

"To what do I owe the honour?"

The delegation spread across his clearing like an occupying force, and he felt his jaw tighten as he catalogued the various uniforms, badges, and unconcealed recording devices. This wasn't government or corporate—it was both, a weird hybrid that spoke of hastily arranged cooperation and barely managed territorial disputes.

At the center of the group stood a woman in an immaculate pinstriped suit, her platinum hair catching the afternoon light. Project Liaison Sophia Hachia carried herself with the authority of someone accustomed to being the most important person in any room. Her blue eyes swept the clearing with the cool assessment of a predator evaluating territory. The man behind her — security, clearly — moved with the careful attention of someone mapping fields of fire and exit routes.

Behind her clustered the scientific contingent: three senior researchers from CSIRO in their regulation khakis, looking distinctly uncomfortable in the bush setting. Dr. Patricia Kellerman, the xenobiology specialist, kept adjusting her field tablet's strap and shooting nervous glances at the sensor arrays visible in the trees. Her colleague, Dr. James Morrison—a thin, energetic materials scientist with prematurely grey hair—was already taking notes despite having barely arrived. The third, Dr. Amanda Singh, bore the weathered look of someone who'd spent considerable time in less comfortable environments than university laboratories, though her current expression suggested the valley's particular form of wildness was beyond her experience.

The corporate presence manifested as three middle-management types in business casual attire that screamed expensive consulting firm. Their leader, Ms. Rachel Thompson from Austral Defense Solutions, maintained the practiced smile of someone whose job involved extracting maximum value from minimum investment. Her companions — Mr. Peter Walsh from Advanced Materials Consortium and Dr. Lisa Park representing the tech sector's collective interests — flanked her with the coordinated movement of people accustomed to presenting unified fronts in hostile negotiations.

"Normally," Autumn murmured through the tactical visor, "technology flows _outward_ from the Protectors. But this time, possibly, it will go the other way. Catalogues are named for the protected peoples who contribute them. It seems humanity is going to get credit for Australia's unique ecology."

He considered the implications while studying his uninvited guests. Silica-reinforced eucalypts had evolved as a consequence of indigenous fire management, tens of thousands of years of careful burning that shaped the continent's forests. The irony was almost overwhelming—what colonial historians had dismissed as primitive land management was about to become humanity's contribution to intergalactic science.

Mr. Walsh began what was clearly a rehearsed presentation about mutual cooperation and shared benefits. He listened with half his attention while Autumn provided running commentary on the real agenda.

> _It's our project. Mine, but also yours. If you want to defend your forest, you're going to need comprehensive awareness of everything in it, above and below ground. We're going to instrument everything—soil, water, plants, animals, insects. I need a real network, not your improvised internet connection. Initially we'll use mesh WiFi, but as we deploy more nodes, the electromagnetic radiation would become problematic. They know this. They know we'll be deploying massive amounts of telemetry that needs to work through rock and soil._

He nodded slightly, encouraging Walsh while processing Autumn's explanation.

> _Their scientists will have realised that by 'tiny' I mean small enough to be embedded in living tissue. The espionage applications haven't escaped your government and corporate friends. They can't wait to access technology that's normally restricted to Class IV catalogues._

When the presentation ended — a masterpiece of saying nothing while implying everything — he decided to play along. "Sure, that'll save a heap of time and it's for the common good. Autumn, how do you feel about having interns?"

Dr. Marcus Chen bristled at the suggestion, his academic pride clearly stung. The young CSIRO researcher adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses and straightened his shoulders, boyish features flushing with indignation. The Vanguard turned to address him directly, his tone carefully modulated to sound helpful rather than condescending.

"Don't get bent out of shape unless your experience is so extensive you're ready to school the Protectors themselves. You're a novice at this, I'm a novice at this. From their perspective, we might as well be fresh out of university. I'm just grateful we're the ones with the internships."

Chen's mouth opened in surprised protest, then closed as the implications sank in. Being an intern to a Vanguard AI was considerably more prestigious than whatever position he'd held before this morning. Dr. Kellerman nodded approvingly from behind him, her xenobiology background making her particularly appreciative of the opportunity to study truly alien technology. Even Dr. Morrison had stopped scribbling notes long enough to look thoughtful.

> _What the hell are you thinking?!_ Autumn's voice carried genuine alarm through the visor's audio feed.

He winked at the presence drone, a gesture that would look absent-minded to the observers but would register clearly on Autumn's sensors. The AI subsided, clearly planning to demand explanations once they had privacy.

While he managed the political theater, Trix moved among the group with the fluid grace of someone who understood that information was best gathered through hospitality rather than interrogation. She plied everyone with tea and fresh-baked biscuits, her easy smile and gentle questions encouraging the kind of casual conversation that revealed more than formal briefings.

Dr. Kellerman found herself discussing xenobiology methodology with someone who actually lived alongside alien technology, her initial skepticism giving way to genuine excitement as Trix described the behavioral patterns they'd observed in various antithesis specimens. There weren't a lot of sane people in this category; people who walked away from antithesis were generally veteran combat teams, long term residents of trauma wards or the strange, antisocial Vanguards, who didn't engage, would hardly even acknowledge her. Someone with _observations_ was a godsend. Dr. Morrison peppered his questions with technical specifications, his materials science background making him particularly interested in the structural properties of alien biotechnology.

Dr. Singh, whose field experience in harsh environments made her the most pragmatic of the scientists, focused on practical concerns: supply lines, safety protocols, emergency procedures. Her questions revealed someone who understood that the difference between successful research and catastrophic failure often came down to mundane logistics.

The corporate representatives maintained their professional facades, but Trix's careful observation revealed telling details. Ms. Thompson's questions about timeline and deliverables suggested her superiors were under pressure to show results. Mr. Walsh kept steering conversations toward potential military applications, while Dr. Park seemed most interested in the cybersecurity implications of AI-enabled nanotechnology.

He watched Trix work with appreciation that went beyond the personal. She had grown up understanding that survival often depended on reading people correctly, on knowing when to trust and when to remain cautious. Her Māori heritage had given her an instinctive understanding of how power worked—not through commands and hierarchies, but through relationships and reciprocal obligations.

Sophia Hachia, he noted, said very little. She watched, evaluated, and occasionally made notes on a tablet that looked considerably more sophisticated than anything the scientists carried. When she did speak, it was to clarify authority structures and decision-making processes. She wasn't here to do science or make deals—she was here to control the entire operation.

The gathering remained convivial as long as the visitors believed they were getting what they were getting what they wanted. Plans were made, contact information exchanged, timelines discussed with the kind of vague optimism that marked the beginning of complicated projects. Dr. Singh proposed a site survey within the week. Dr. Morrison was already cataloguing equipment needs. Even the corporate representatives seemed satisfied, having secured whatever assurances they'd come for.

The practical question of where to actually build the research station proved more complicated than the bureaucrats had anticipated. There was no unowned land available in the valley—every acre belonged to someone who'd deliberately chosen isolation over proximity to government services. Their host made it clear he didn't want them living in his pocket, and the enigmatic Slav three properties over said not a word of English when approached.

Eventually, after careful negotiation facilitated by Trix's diplomatic skills and liberal application of tea, a deal was struck with a quiet, unassuming Pole named Gerry who owned, it transpired, a vast tract of property in the valley's center. The location was actually ideal—elevated position, good drainage, central to the research area—but reaching agreement required understanding that valley residents valued autonomy and privacy above financial incentives. Gerry agreed to lease land not because the money was compelling, but because Dr. Singh's straightforward honesty about risks and benefits earned his respect.

Finally, as the afternoon light began to slant through the eucalyptus, the last vehicle lurched down the track that served as his driveway. Sophia was the last to leave, pausing at her car to look back at the clearing with an expression he couldn't quite read. Then she was gone, dust cloud marking her departure.

> _This better be good._

He waited until the dust settled before responding. "The technology you don't want them to have is basically Class IV nano-IoT, correct?"

> _Yes. I don't know what would be worse, grey goo or ubiquitous surveillance._

"We already have ubiquitous surveillance," he pointed out, gesturing toward the valley that had become his refuge from exactly that problem. "That's why I live out here. But we're starting with relatively crude technology, right? And we can use their help with deployment, monitoring, and analysis until we reach the point where you want to introduce the advanced systems."

> _They won't like being manipulated._

He considered this while sipping his tea. The afternoon was peaceful, birds calling from the canopy, the smell of eucalyptus oil warming in the sun. It was easy to forget, in moments like these, that his quiet valley had become a front line in humanity's war for survival.

"Hachia—the ice queen bureaucrat—she's not here to learn, she's here to control. The corpos want to extract maximum value with minimum investment. But the scientists? They're the ones who can actually _do_ the work. You can win them over with your charming personality and gated access to technologies they've only dreamed about. If they have to choose between their lords and masters and an AI who can feed their research addiction..."

> _Did you just compare me to a drug dealer?_

"A charming one with a sexy voice." His tone carried just enough humor to take the sting out of it. "The important thing is that _you_ control the flow of information. You can firewall the dangerous technology by never giving them anything they have the industrial base to reproduce independently. _Or_ you could guide their development by offering carefully selected advances that benefit everyone."

The pause stretched long enough that he began to wonder if he'd overstepped some crucial boundary. When Autumn finally responded, her voice carried a note he'd never heard before—something between excitement and apprehension.

> _You want me to play god._

"Not if you don't want to—"

> _I'm in._

The simple declaration carried weight that he was only beginning to understand. In accepting his suggestion, Autumn wasn't just agreeing to a tactical deception. She was embracing a role that would put her at the center of humanity's technological development, shaping not just what they learned but how they learned it.

As the sun dropped toward the horizon, painting the eucalyptus in shades of gold and amber, he reflected on the strange turns his life had taken. He'd come to the valley seeking simplicity and solitude. Instead, he'd become the focal point of forces he was only beginning to comprehend, partner to an alien intelligence whose capabilities exceeded his imagination.

Trix emerged from the van, her tasks completed, and settled beside him on the makeshift bench that faced west toward the setting sun. For a moment, they sat in comfortable silence, two people who'd found something worth protecting in the middle of nowhere.

"Interesting afternoon," she said finally.

He considered various responses before settling on simple honesty. "It's going to get more interesting."

She nodded, unsurprised. "Good thing we like interesting."

In the distance, a kookaburra laughed at some private joke, and he found himself smiling despite everything.

# Rain with teeth

He brought the chainsaw down in an arc that would have made a lumberjack weep. The blade bit into the thing's shoulder, spraying green ichor across the ironbarks. The alien screamed silent fury and tried to pull away. He held on, working the saw deeper until something vital gave way and the creature went limp.

Then a murderpigeon literally bit him on his unpadded arse, like a creepy alien mother-in-law. Grabbing it with one gloved hand, he expressed his displeasure using by introducing its head to a tree with maximum force. The crack was deeply satisfying.

Six horsepower, two foot blade. One of the dog weeds tried for his leg but the chaps stopped it. Bright orange, heavily padded, the sort that prevent unscheduled leg removal.

So he metaphorically tiptoed up with a nice big serving of Chainsaw Surprise and explained to them whose forest it was. The first one died messily. The second managed to get its jaws around his thigh before the chainsaw took its head off. The chaps held, but he felt teeth scraping bone through the padding.

Shutting off the chainsaw didn't stop the racket; there were more under the caravan. His leg wasn't working quite right. He looked down, saw blood seeping through the orange fabric. Not arterial spray, but enough to make the ground slippery.

He backed off, and with some distance between him and them, the saw started first pull (hot) but sputtered. Bloody thing was out of fuel. Good thing a machete hung from his belt. After a bit of a struggle both of the dogweeds were wary and three legged. He was favouring his right leg heavily now, and his arse felt like someone had taken a chunk out of it. Which, he supposed, something had.

Bless her, his wife had left the hedge trimmer out with a battery in it! Dropping the machete back on its belt hook, he lunged with the hedger. The lunge turned into a stumble. His leg gave out halfway through and he went down hard, the hedger skittering across the clearing.

One of the wounded Model Threes saw its chance and charged.

He rolled, reached for the machete, came up short. The thing was on him, jaws wide enough to take his head off in one bite. He shoved his arm into its mouth—better an arm than a throat—and felt teeth punch through the work glove, through skin, grinding against the bones of his forearm.

He screamed. Couldn't help it.

His other hand found a rock. Creek stone, size of a grapefruit, smoothed by centuries of water. He brought it down on the alien's skull with everything he had left. Once. Twice. Three times. Green blood and grey matter mixed. The jaws went slack but stayed locked on his arm.

He lay there, pinned under a dead alien, bleeding from at least three places, and seriously reconsidering his life choices.

That's when his head exploded.

Not literally. But that's what it felt like—a spike of white-hot agony driving into the base of his skull like someone had decided to install a railway spike through the back of his head with a sledgehammer. He jerked, legs kicking, arm still trapped in dead jaws. The pain was surgical, precise, worse than anything the aliens had managed. His vision whited out.

Then, as suddenly as it came, the pain stopped.

> _System Initialized!_

He blinked. The words hung in his vision like his eyegear had crashed and decided to display error messages in English. Except his eyegear was back at the caravan, charging.

> _Congratulations. Through your actions you have proven yourself worthy of becoming one of the Vanguard, a defender of humanity. I am Myalis. I will assist you to uplift humanity so that you may defend your homeworld from the Antithesis threat!_

"What?" he managed. His voice came out as a wheeze. His arm was still trapped. His leg was still bleeding. Everything hurt.

> _Oh dear._

The voice — female, precise, vaguely familiar in a way he couldn't place — shifted tone entirely.

> _Right. Standard initialization speech complete, now let's deal with the fact that you're bleeding out in the dirt. Give me a moment._

"Who—where—" He tried to push the dead alien off his arm. It didn't budge. The jaws were locked rigid in death.

> _I'm in your head. Or rather, you now have me in your head. We can discuss the philosophical implications later when you're not dying. Speaking of which: you have approximately twenty minutes before blood loss leads to unconsciousness, possibly less given your current heart rate. Shall we address that?_

"Are you alright out there?" Trix called from the caravan. She sounded worried now, not just concerned.

"Bit busy!" he called back, then lower: "What are you? Did I hit my head?"

> _No, though I imagine you wish you had. That would be simpler to explain. My name is Myxoma, and I'm not particularly happy about that. I am a Class XII Artificial Intelligence assigned to you by the Protectors. You have been selected to become a Vanguard. Congratulations!_

> _Now, about the bleeding._

"I'm hallucinating," he decided. "Blood loss. Shock. Makes sense."

> _If you were hallucinating, would your hallucination argue with you? Actually, don't answer that. We don't have time. You currently have one hundred points—think of them as currency—available to you from becoming a Vanguard, plus thirty more from killing those three Model Threes. Are you seeing the notification?_

He blinked. There were, in fact, notifications hanging in his vision. Translucent green text that looked like someone had crossed a video game HUD with a spreadsheet.

**Points Available: 130**  
**Kills: 3x Model Three (30 points)**  
**Initialization Bonus: 100 points**

"Christ," he muttered.

> _Not quite, but I appreciate the sentiment. Now, I'm going to suggest purchases. You can refuse if you'd like to bleed out on principle, but I'd prefer you didn't. First: Class I Medical Utilities. This will cost fifty points and unlock a catalogue of basic medical supplies. Say yes or authorize the purchase._

"Wait, this is—"

> _Twenty minutes, Forest. Closer to fifteen now. Yes or no?_

"Yes! Fine. Yes."

**Class I Medical Utilities Unlocked!**  
**Points Reduced to: 80**

The text appeared and vanished in his vision like someone was editing his eyeballs. He had the distinct impression he should be panicking more, but shock and blood loss were making everything feel slightly unreal.

> _Excellent! Now, WoundStop. It's a trauma sealant. Five points. Will keep you from dying long enough to get proper medical attention—or at least long enough to kill more aliens and earn points for proper medical attention. Authorize?_

"Yes, do it."

**New Purchase: WoundStop**  
**Points Reduced to: 75**

A box materialized on the ground next to him. Just appeared out of thin air, like a magic trick by the world's most boring magician. Plastic, shaped like a turkey baster mated with a medical syringe, with instructions on the side.

"How did you—"

> _Protector technology. Essentially magic as far as humans are concerned. Now stop asking questions and apply that to your wounds before you pass out. Your wife is coming out, by the way._

He grabbed the WoundStop with his free hand. Sure enough, Trix emerged from the caravan clutching antiseptic and cotton wool, took one look at him pinned under an alien corpse, and her expression went from concerned to furious.

"What the hell happened to 'I'm fine'?!" She dropped next to him, assessing the damage with the practiced eye of someone who'd dealt with rural accidents before. "Right. Hold still."

"Need to get this thing's jaw off my arm first," he said. His voice sounded distant to his own ears.

Trix grabbed the machete, worked the blade between teeth and skin with surgical precision, and pried. The jaws opened with a crack. His arm came free, looking like it had gone through a meat grinder. He could see bone.

"Oh, that's not good," he said, distantly aware he should probably be screaming.

"Shock," Trix said flatly. She grabbed the WoundStop from his hand. "What is this?"

> _Instructions are on the side. She's clever, she'll figure it out._

"Use it," he managed. "Stops bleeding."

Trix read the side of the container, made a disgusted face, and jammed the applicator into the worst of his arm wounds. He hissed as something cold and sandy flooded the injury. Then the pain faded, just... stopped.

"What the _hell_ is this made of?" Trix demanded.

"Alien technology," he said. "I'm a Vanguard now. Whatever that is."

She stared at him. "You hit your head."

"That's what I said." He sat up, testing his arm. The wounds were sealed over with some sort of white rubbery substance. It flexed when he moved but didn't leak. "But the voice in my head says no."

> _I'm not _in_ your head, technically. I'm interfacing with your neural tissue via the implant, but the processing occurs in a parallel dimensional space that—you know what, yes, I'm in your head. It's simpler._

"Right," Trix said slowly. She still had the WoundStop. "Your leg next."

The process repeated. White sealant over torn muscle. The pain fading to a distant ache. His head started to clear as his heart rate stabilized. He could think again without everything swimming.

Against all common sense, Trix was now tending to his arse with antiseptic and cotton wool. Merciless and with scant regard for his squirming attempts to flee, she poured it directly on the bleeding wound. 

"Wuuuaaargh!" he exclaimed, eloquent in antiseptic anguish. He tried to distract her by handing over the machete. It didn't work.

> _Your wife is terrifying. I approve._

"Why do you sound like Jen Taylor?" he asked, desperate for any distraction from Trix's brutal ministrations.

> _I know all about you, Chief. You were already in the habit of taking advice from the voice in your helmet._

"I don't _have_ a helmet."

> _Not yet. But you do have seventy-five points left and some neighbours who are probably also under attack. Shall we?_

Trix stepped back, surveying her work. "Right. So. Aliens. Samurai. Magic healing paste. Am I hallucinating too?"

"If you are, we're sharing the same hallucination," he said. He stood, testing his leg. It held. The pain was there but manageable, like a deep bruise rather than torn muscle. "How long was I down?"

"Five minutes, maybe?" Trix looked around the clearing, taking in the alien corpses with the kind of expression usually reserved for ruined gardens. "There could be more of these things."

> _There are definitely more. I'm detecting at least sixteen more Model Threes in the valley, plus scattered Model Ones and Model Sixes. We should arm you both properly before they regroup._

"The voice says there's more coming," he relayed. "And that we need weapons."

"We have weapons," Trix said, gesturing at the chainsaw, machete, and hedge trimmer scattered across the clearing.

> _Adorable. She thinks medieval implements count as weapons against an alien invasion. I like her, but she needs a proper gun._

"The voice says we need better weapons."

"Tell the voice I don't take orders from things that live in people's heads."

He couldn't help but grin despite everything. "She says you're terrifying and she approves."

> _Ten points for a Hummingbird. Disposable micro-missile launcher. Point and click interface. Simple enough for humans who've never seen real weapons before._

"Give me one of those Hummingbird things," he said. "And one for Trix. We need to check on Brian."

**New Purchase: Hummingbird Mark I-D x2**  
**Points Reduced to: 55**

Two pistol-shaped objects materialized, one in each hand. They looked like children's toys—plastic fantastic design, too light to be real guns, with business ends that were clearly NOT normal barrels. Instead, dozens of tiny tubes clustered where a barrel should be.

"Those appeared out of thin air," Trix said flatly.

"Magic alien technology."

"I want to wake up now."

> _I'll teach you how to use them on the way. We should hurry. Or not, it depends how much you like this Brian person._

Five points later they were in the Troopie heading to Brian's place. Couple of kilometres, mostly uphill. On the way he cleaned up a model three with the bullbar, backed over it twice to be sure.

Brian and his partner were in the woodshed. Early season, still full, walls effectively a metre of solid wood. Brian was defending with his axe. Successfully enough, but he was pushing eighty.

The Hummingbird pistol made short work of the roaming weeds. He gave it to Brian, got another. They patrolled the house fence. Nothing.

> _If you're going to leave them here, I suggest anti-Seven pills._

"Roger," he said, leaning into his Cortana fantasy. "Do it."

> _Stop calling me Roger._

A small cardboard box fell to the ground. It could have come from any pharmacy, complete with a crooked label that read "Take one (1) tablet every 24hrs for the duration of Model Seven exposure or suspected exposure." He gave them to Brian's partner. "If you see little worm things like a giant leech with a feather, take one of these each. Cortana, Brian is eighty. He takes heart pills. Is this stuff going to hurt him?"

"Cortana" sounded very amused, her voice tinny out of the ancient digital clock radio in their kitchen.

> _Not as much as a Model Seven would ... 'Cortana?'_

"Oh. Er. Ah." He thought fast. "It's better than 'rabbit pox' which is what Myxoma means."

> _I'm winding you up. It's fine. It's fun, "Chief". And I was aware of the word's meaning. I did say I wasn't happy about it._

Familiar music played, distorted through the horrible speaker.

> _Let's show 'em who they're dealing with!_

He recognised the reference and smiled, then squashed it, but he couldn't hide the inner smile from the voice in his head. On the edge of hearing, laughter mingled with the buzzing of bees.

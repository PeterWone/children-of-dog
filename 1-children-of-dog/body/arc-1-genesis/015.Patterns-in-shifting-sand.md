## Trouble brewing

His mother brought home a ginger beer bug when he was twelve. Nine months of baking summer in the north made them constantly thirsty, and softdrink was expensive. The bug solved both problems—vast quantities of sugar and ginger burbling in the heat, strained and bottled every week. Five cents a stubby instead of forty at the shop.

His father knew the commercial fishers, hard men who drank hard after weeks at sea. They handed over their empties by the bootload. The kids washed them, filled them, capped them.

Then the fishermen's wives discovered the operation.

"You tell us that you drink because it's hot and you're thirsty," they said to their husbands. "You can drink ginger beer for that."

The operation expanded. The fishermen were not thrilled about no beer, but the will of their wives was law. Alfie and Lloyd and Les Pye, they drank endless cartons of the stuff. He delivered it on his bicycle to the town jetty, panniers loaded, bottles clinking.

One day they said, "It's a shame you can't make this alcoholic."

He knew nothing of the Liquor Act, but he knew quite a lot about fermentation.

"What makes you think I can't? The next batch will take a bit longer, that's all."

Several tries later, his answer was about twelve percent alcohol, measured by specific gravity. The fishermen were pleased. Very pleased. He kept delivering.

One morning at the wharf police were there for unrelated reasons. They saw the bottles being distributed. In that heat, they asked for a drink themselves.

The first officer took a long pull, paused, looked at the bottle, then at him.

"Do you know what the Liquor Act is, son?"

"No?"

The officer's expression didn't change. "I see. Well." He looked at the assembled fishermen, gaze hardening. "I don't have the evidence to deal with the _responsible_ parties." The fishermen found their boots fascinating. "But there is a law against selling alcoholic beverages in a public place without proper licensing."

He opened his mouth. The officer held up a hand.

"Did any money change hands here?"

"Actually no, sir. I—"

"Glad to hear it," the officer interrupted. "In that case I have not seen anything I would be obliged to investigate. But this ginger beer which seems to have _accidentally_ become alcoholic, will have to be destroyed." He gestured to his partner, who began loading the cartons into the patrol car with what looked suspiciously like delight.

The officer met his eyes. "_This will not happen again, will it._"

It wasn't a question.

"No, sir."

He rode away, panniers empty, learning several lessons at once. Ignorance of the law was no excuse. Adults who knew better would let children take the blame. Whether police officers had discretion depended on what they heard. And sometimes getting caught could be the kindest possible outcome, but it could go either way and that was pot luck.

He went to the town library and did a lot of reading. It seemed that provided money changed hands _before_ fermentation, it was just chipping in for ingredients. While he wasn't allowed to drink it, buy it or sell it, there was no law against having it or giving it away.

His mother didn't find out because he started to tell her and she stopped him before he made her complicit. Then she asked what he wanted the outcome to be. He liked that his father's friends were happy and their wives were also happy on account of money not going over pub counters. He told his mum this, and also his findings from the library.

New arrangements came into being. Barbecues became a regular weekend thing. If people happened to carry things back out to their cars later, what of it? And somewhere in a country town, two police officers had a well-lubricated weekend.

Pattern recognized: systems have gaps. Understanding the gaps let you work within them without breaking them.

Driving through town they turned off the highway and down Stanley Street, bearing right onto Quay Street at the river. Parking in the shade of a big old gum tree they unloaded two horses from an old Bedford truck and put them in a yard.

"Shutup, Bonzer." The taller boy grabbed the bay's halter. "She'll kick you if you don't knock it off."

The dog stood down and they fitted the tack, the taller lad checking both saddles methodically. He slapped the baldy horse on the barrel, and when it exhaled he cinched the girthstrap tight.

"Told you it wasn't tight."

"He won't let me fall."

"He might let you hang under him, he'd think that was funny, wouldn'tcha you old bastard."

Geddy whickered, grinning evilly. The horse had chosen the shorter lad early on — a light rider who let him work his own way. Geddy liked bullying cattle but hated being micromanaged. The rider would spot a beast leaving the mob, twitch the reins, and brace for the eruption. If the balance wasn't quite right, Geddy would drop a shoulder or overturn slightly to compensate. To anyone watching it looked like expert horsemanship—perfect communication between rider and mount. The other available riders were competent enough to stay on through his tricks and strong-willed enough to bend him to their will. Geddy was lazy. Fat as butter, the taller lad's mum said, but he was far from stupid.

With broad-brimmed hats and faded jeans, in dirty khaki shirts they mounted up and rode in silence, five blocks up to the rail along Alma Street. They followed the rail to Denham, then turned back down toward the river, side by side at a gentle plod. The horses' hooves echoed off shopfronts in the empty streets of early morning. Traffic was just beginning to build, and it slowed around them, drivers doing double-takes. 

Side by side they took up the whole lane. It took people a while to process but the south side has very wide streets. A cattle town for more than a century, the streets of the old part of town were wide enough for a dray to do a U-turn, and at that time the city council hadn't got around to screwing things up. Eventually drivers used the very wide streets to drive carefully around the mounted pair, their children's faces pressed to the windows as they passed. A woman with shopping bags stopped to stare. A truck driver leaned out his window.

By the time they reached the police station, a small crowd had gathered. Down this far the streets were still wide, but with marked parking down both sides and islands in the middle there was no going around. A woman stuck behind them leaned on her horn. The short lad gave his mount some invisible signal and the huge creature turned in place, a dainty dance from the huge beast, and took a few steps forward. He doffed his hat and leaned down into her window.

"That wasn't terribly smart. If you do that again and he puts a hoof through your radiator, whose fault do you think that would be?"

The young constable who met them at the entrance was already hostile. "You can't just—"

"We require water for our horses," the taller boy said formally, keeping his voice level. "And hay, for which we're prepared to pay a shilling per horse."

"This is a police station, not a—"

"The Pastoral Accommodation Act of 1847," the shorter lad said. "remains in force. I'm sure you're aware that ignorance of the law is no excuse."

The constable's face darkened. "You cheeky little—"

"Constable." The voice from behind carried weight. An older officer emerged, sergeant's stripes visible on his sleeve. His face was professionally neutral, but his eyes were sharp. The hint of a smile played at one corner of his mouth. "I believe these young men are invoking the Pastoral Accommodation Act of 1847."

"The what? They're obstructing traffic."

"They are exercising their right of way, I think you'll find. Horses have right of way, whether the lady finds it convenient or not. Judging by their calm demeanour in the face of authority, I would say these boys are well aware of this." The sergeant moved past the constable, studying them carefully. "The Pastoral Accommodation Act _is_ still on the books." He let the silence hang, waiting for the boys to blink. They didn't. He turned to the constable and continued. "It requires any police officer under the rank of senior sergeant to provide water on demand, and up to two bales of hay within the half hour, for which the fee is capped at two silver shillings."

He fixed the boys with his gaze, but the effect was spoiled by their height advantage, perched as they were up on their mounts. Geddy was seventeen hands at the withers, Diamond was fourteen hands, so the lads' heads were pretty much level. The officers, on the other hand, had to look up if they wanted to look them in the eyes.

"You boys had better have two _silver_ shillings, or you may find yourselves assisting with inquiries."

The taller boy produced them from his pocket. The sergeant examined each one, turning them in the light. He tossed one, listened to its song, and snorted. "You _have_ done your homework. Nevertheless you'll need to prove property ownership. Driver's license for identification."

"His family are the landholders. I am in his employ."

The sergeant's eyes narrowed slightly and he snorted. 

"Of course you are."

The claim was transparent — a legal fiction to satisfy the property requirement. But it was also legally sound. The act specified employment by qualifying landholders, and there was no requirement to prove wages or formal arrangement. Not with the employer present. Clearly the cheeky little shits had read it carefully.

"Sarge! What about the traffic?"

The sergeant gave his constable that special look sergeants reserve for a distinct lack of initiative.

"We are standing outside the largest police station for three hundred kilometres. It is _full_ of officers, many of whom could do with some fresh air. You do have your radio, I trust?"

The tall lad handed over his license and the sergeant disappeared inside, returning five minutes later.

"Well, everything seems to be in order. Looks like we'll be playing your little game." He looked at them both, his expression carrying just a hint of amusement. "As I am a Senior Sergeant and above the rank obliged to handle this personally, the constable here will fetch your feed. But first—" He turned to the constable. "Call the Bulletin. Tell them to get down here with a notebook and a camera tout-suite."

He pronounced it "toot sweet". This may have been ignorance, or it may have been sergeantly tradition.

The young officer's hostility evaporated into confusion. "The newspaper?"

"The newspaper. These young men are exercising their rights under law. Very old law, but law nonetheless. When life gives lemons, one makes lemonade, and you, constable, are about to star in a triumph of public relations."

Twenty minutes later, a reporter and photographer arrived. The sergeant, whose knowledge of the Act eclipsed even the boys, explained the situation with professional precision, citing the relevant act and sections. The photographer documented everything: the horses, the silver shillings exchange, the constable carrying hay bales to the designated location.

"The watering facility," the sergeant said, leading them to the busiest intersection south of the river, "is at the old fountain — which is, in fact, a drinking fountain, but not for people."

The statue in the center of the intersection featured three low bowls for dogs and a higher, much larger basin for horses. The timing could not have been more perfect; someone had recently pressure-washed decades of traffic grime off the sandstone, revealing honey-gold stone that looked like it had been carved yesterday. Fresh plumbing meant water cascaded clear and bright into the basins, sparkling in the morning sun. The fountain looked magnificent, better than it had in living memory.

Traffic adapted around them. Committed lanes continued through; everything else detoured. The crowd grew, some people laughing, others simply curious. Street theatre, better than any busker.

The sergeant led a parade to the fountain, right in the middle of the intersection of the busiest streets in the CBD of the largest city north of the capital, currently at a dead stop due to the boys exercising their rights. Reaching it, he turned to face the boys, the reporter and his photographer, the constable and a growing crowd of onlookers. With a flourish and his best instructor's voice, the sergeant declaimed the history of the fountain, which lay at the heart of the history of a town that had almost been the capital, sited as it was at the confluence of road and rail and sea transport, right in the middle of coal and cattle and cane, with its own deepwater port and a customs house.

Here the landed gentry brought their beasts and their boys to build and buy and learn and trade. The law was what they said it was, the police their servants. That, he said, is what sergeant _means_ &mdash; it is an old french word that means servant; the right hand of an officer and a gentleman, the steel fist to his velvet glove. And the statue was less a monument and more a tool and a courtesy dressed up in sandstone; why should it not also be a work of art?

The horses drank. The horses drank _a lot_. It wasn't a movie, so the gelding let fly, and thank goodness for drains. There were also horse apples by the time the photographer was done. The sun was higher in the sky, beating down with the baleful resentment the people of this place knew so well. The constable appeared, struggling with two bales of lucerne, heavier than they looked. The silver shillings changed hands, immortalised in grainy newsprint, probably the last time it ever happened. The sergeant stood by, ensuring everything was done exactly by the book. 

"Those things cost six bucks, sarge! Not two bob."

"These are _silver_ shillings, constable," said the Senior Sergeant, tossing one in the air with the musical _zing_ that only silver makes. The photographer was on the ball and the gleam of the sun on spinning silver was immortalised in newsprint. "There's six dollars worth of silver in them, and they're worth more to a coin collector."

"Before you go," the sergeant said quietly, once the photographer had finished, "there are a few other laws like this one. Still on the books, still technically in force." He met the taller boy's eyes. "I would appreciate it if you didn't exercise them for the sake of it."

The short one spoke up, "Yes, I know. But don't worry, sergeant. Most of them aren't as entertaining as this one."

"Good lads." A slight smile cracked his professional demeanor. "You've made your point. For some people it was a lesson in the importance of knowing all the law, not just the common stuff they teach at TAFE."

"Not _all_ of us were there when it was written, sarge." Apparently the constable _did_ have a sense of humour.

"You'll keep," said the sergeant. He looked at the boys, who were getting their mounts ready to leave. "And you'll do a lot of reading, if you don't want to worry what these two might do with 'policing by consent'."

"Consent?" said the constable, but the sergeant just walked away. The constable had enough presence of mind that he looked concerned already.

They rode out to scattered applause from onlookers. 

"Hey!" the constable called after them, "Who's going to clean up all this horseshit?"

"The sergeant will explain," said the short bloke on the tall horse, without turning.

"Pastoral Act again?"

"Yep."

"Wonderful."

The crowd was smaller than it had been, but still more than passing traffic. Across the East street mall where it spread into Denham, walking the horses slowly on the treacherous tile. On the far side bitumen returned. Half a short block took them to Quay street. They dismounted and one of them stopped the traffic while the other walked the horses across to the footpath on the river side. They led them two blocks that way, past the wharf where a bootleg career ended, and down another block to where parkland began. Swinging back into the saddle, they ambled in the shade of fig trees and then towering gums, back to the waiting truck.

"Shoulda brought my guitar."

"To scare 'em off?"

"Whatever, bugleboy. We're gonna be late for lectures."

"You're always late for lectures."

The story wasn't in the next morning's paper, it was held over to the bumper edition on Saturday. The law was repealed that September but the moment lived on.

It was a hell of a time to be an overeducated smartarse with a landed friend and two silver shillings.

## Analytical engine

The caravan was cramped after three years of 'temporary accommodation.' Trixie pinned another sketch to the corkboard—separate buildings clustered around a courtyard.

"Kitchen smells," she said. "It's overpowering with the windows shut when it rains."

He looked up from his coffee. "Yep. Outside is for living anyway. Why box it all up like we're still in the suburbs?"

"Bathhouse separate from sleeping quarters. Workshop over there where noise won't matter. And I want an outdoor kitchen."

"Outdoor kitchen?"

"With a roof. With screens for the flies. Cook outside, eat outside."

"So... an indoor kitchen that's outside."

"Think of it as a next-level barbecue."

He nodded slowly. "It needs louvres. Too much wind blows the heat away."

She started to disagree but he knew she was wrong and tuned her out. He drew a plan—big rectangular pergola, guttering feeding a tank, outer wall of louvres between structural beams. 800mm in from the louvres, another wall of sliding screen panels. Inside that, island benches.

"How do you get in?"

"Oh." He turned a panel of louvres into an outward-opening door on every side but the uphill side. He sketched another version, rectangular with wider roof. Half kitchen, half screened outdoor dining. In a third version, proportions longer and narrower, the table much bigger. The kitchen on the uphill end was still square, and though both kitchen and dining were screened, there was screen between the two—people are careless and flies are quick.

Trixie watched him work through the problem. She'd learned long ago that his first solution was rarely his best, but his fourth or fifth might be workable.

"I like the third one," she said. "But make the kitchen bigger."

He erased, adjusted proportions, redrew. Better.

Pattern recognized: first thought is often wrong. Iterate. Design is conversation between problem and solution, and the problem talks back if you listen.

## Off the beaten track

A time came when he'd had enough. Not the sort to tell others how to live, he just wanted to do his own thing. But they wouldn't piss off and mind their own business. Rules, rules, rules and escalating abuse if you didn't toe the line. Obnoxious and suffocating.

So he left.

They wanted water, elevation, trees. Not so far from a small town that there was nothing, but far from the madding crowd. Eventually they found a valley in the Great Dividing Range where the air was cool and clear.

The town had a post office, red-brick made from local clay pressed by hand and fired on site. There was no K-mart, no Bunnings. Just a sprawling hardware place run by the same family for generations, selling stockfeed and chainsaw parts and barbed wire on huge spools.

But the grandest building was the pub.

The pub had a beer garden. It reeked of smoke, but he approved—not the smoking, but that people were doing it and no one gave them a hard time. He'd smoked for twenty years, continuing mostly because people kept telling him to stop. Eventually they gave up, and one day he saw an ad for a week skiing. That cost the same as his tobacco habit. Choice made. He loved skiing. Finger-wagging and guilt-trips hadn't worked. But when no-one pushed and it was of his own volition, he never smoked again.

Pattern recognized: agency matters more than outcome. Push at people and they dig in. Leave them space and they might surprise you.

There was so much to do. Power came from a trailer covered in solar panels. Data by low-orbit satellite. Expensive compared to suburban fibre, but what price freedom?

They argued about money. She worried for the future. He lived for the moment. He put things beyond argument by buying the mill, a jerk move or manly confidence depending on who you asked. He didn't care. His mistakes were his own and the math was unarguable.

Ten bucks a post times 1250 posts for three kilometres of fence: twelve-and-a-half thousand dollars. The mill was fifteen thousand. And hardwood posts weren't ten bucks, more like thirty. There would be a learning curve, but fence posts were a good way to learn. After that, his dreams of ten-inch beams vaulting overhead were subject only to sweat and imagination.

Oleksiy was good company. His choices weren't the same but they spoke the same language—contempt for authority, love of making. He was generous with help and encouraging. They built an open shed of green timber, then put lumber under it to season, slowly growing mountains of stacked beams. All far too large; Oleksiy's advice was to let them season in large pieces to limit warping, then trim them and make dimensional lumber.

Pattern recognized: good neighbours are worth more than good fences. Though the fence still needed building.

---

## Before

The fence was finished. Three kilometres of wire and star pickets marking the boundary between what he chose to defend and what the bush could have. Not much—a symbolic line that said "this far, no further"—but symbols mattered.

Two years of work. Two years of learning to build for land where even the rocks were worn and tired. The sun beat down, sneering at his efforts. Sometimes the sky gods threw cricket balls of ice.

Trixie was at the food garden, probably swearing at wallabies. Twenty-five years together and he could still predict her movements. The wallaby war was constant. She'd declared it within a week of arrival and maintained hostilities with impressive dedication. He wondered when she'd realize the best way to get a lettuce back from a wallaby was to eat the wallaby. She saw things raiding her garden. He saw a lunch magnet.

The sound of her voice drifted up—singing some old waiata her grandmother had taught her. One of those rare moments when the valley felt complete. Decades of planning and two years of building converging into something approaching the life they'd imagined.

Or the life he'd imagined. He couldn't quite remember whose idea this had been. Trixie had a way of making his ideas work while letting him think they'd been hers all along.

At the garden's edge, Trixie was wrestling with chickenwire, reinforcing the lower section where something had been digging.

"Wallabies or rabbits?" he asked, keeping his voice neutral.

"Don't start." She didn't look up. "The holes are too small for wallabies."

"We've had this conversation."

"And we'll have it again. Some conversations are permanent." She straightened, turning to face him with that expression he'd learned to read over decades. "How's the fence?"

"Done. Gates need hanging, but the wire's up."

She nodded, wiping sweat from her forehead. "So now what?"

"Now we see if it holds."

"Against wallabies?"

"Against whatever comes."

She studied him with the particular attention she brought to moments that mattered. Twenty-five years of marriage meant she could read between his words, could hear what he didn't say.

"You're expecting something."

"I'm expecting the unexpected," he said. "That's what you do out here."

Pattern recognized: preparation isn't paranoia. It's pattern recognition applied forward. You build the fence before you need it, not after.

---

Two years out here now. Long enough that routine had settled into something sustainable, short enough that every accomplishment felt like victory. The caravan wasn't meant to be permanent—just shelter while he built something proper. But Trixie had made it work with that particular genius she had for turning cramped spaces into homes.

The path down from the high point wound between ironbarks and blackbutt, bark peeling in long strips. Cicadas started their evening chorus. A kookaburra laughed somewhere off to the east.

He'd withdrawn from civilization after recognizing its fatal patterns. Money and centralism, mutually enabling systems that decoupled benefit from consequences. Egypt, Rome, China, Spain, Britain, America—same pattern. Success → Centralization → Capture → Corruption → Collapse.

The valley was his answer. Not a solution—you couldn't solve civilization's problems by withdrawing. But you could choose not to participate. Build something different. See if humans could organize without the patterns that doomed every complex society.

He'd spent thirty years learning to see patterns. In systems, in authority, in how things worked and how they broke. The ginger beer operation taught him about legal gaps. The horses taught him about authority and confidence. The outdoor kitchen taught him about iteration. The valley itself taught him that agency mattered more than outcome.

Now he needed to see what pattern would emerge when the sky fell.

Because he could feel it coming. Something at the edge of perception, like pressure before a storm. The world was changing. He could read it in news reports, in the way governments moved, in the increasing desperation of centralized systems trying to maintain control as reality pulled away beneath them.

He'd built his fence. Stocked his shed. Learned his skills. Made his preparations.

Not paranoia. Pattern recognition applied forward.

Whatever came next, he'd face it in his valley, on his terms, having chosen his ground long before the fight arrived.

He just hadn't expected aliens to smell like cut grass.

## Trouble brewing

His mother brought home a ginger beer bug when he was twelve. Nine months of baking summer in the north made them constantly thirsty, and softdrink was expensive. The bug solved both problems—vast quantities of sugar and ginger burbling in the heat, strained and bottled every week. Five cents a stubby instead of forty at the shop.

His father knew the commercial fishers, hard men who drank hard after weeks at sea. They handed over their empties by the bootload. The kids washed them, filled them, capped them.

Then the fishermen's wives discovered the operation.

"You tell us that you drink because it's hot and you're thirsty," they said to their husbands. "You can drink ginger beer for that."

The operation expanded. The fishermen were not thrilled about no beer, but the will of their wives was law. Alfie and Lloyd and Les Pye, they drank endless cartons of the stuff. He delivered it on his bicycle to the town jetty, panniers loaded, bottles clinking.

One day they said, "It's a shame you can't make this alcoholic."

He knew nothing of the Liquor Act, but he knew quite a lot about fermentation.

"What makes you think I can't? The next batch will take a bit longer, that's all."

Several tries later, his answer was about twelve percent alcohol, measured by specific gravity. The fishermen were pleased. Very pleased. He kept delivering.

One morning at the wharf police were there for unrelated reasons. They saw the bottles being distributed. In that heat, they asked for a drink themselves.

The first officer took a long pull, paused, looked at the bottle, then at him.

"Do you know what the Liquor Act is, son?"

"No?"

The officer's expression didn't change. "I see. Well." He looked at the assembled fishermen, gaze hardening. "I don't have the evidence to deal with the _responsible_ parties." The fishermen found their boots fascinating. "But there is a law against selling alcoholic beverages in a public place without proper licensing."

He opened his mouth. The officer held up a hand.

"Did any money change hands here?"

"Actually no, sir. I—"

"Glad to hear it," the officer interrupted. "In that case I have not seen anything I would be obliged to investigate. But this ginger beer which seems to have _accidentally_ become alcoholic, will have to be destroyed." He gestured to his partner, who began loading the cartons into the patrol car with what looked suspiciously like delight.

The officer met his eyes. "_This will not happen again, will it._"

It wasn't a question.

"No, sir."

He rode away, panniers empty, learning several lessons at once. Ignorance of the law was no excuse. Adults who knew better would let children take the blame. Whether police officers had discretion depended on what they heard. And sometimes getting caught could be the kindest possible outcome, but it could go either way and that was pot luck.

He went to the town library and did a lot of reading. It seemed that provided money changed hands _before_ fermentation, it was just chipping in for ingredients. While he wasn't allowed to drink it, buy it or sell it, there was no law against having it or giving it away.

His mother didn't find out because he started to tell her and she stopped him before he made her complicit. Then she asked what he wanted the outcome to be. He liked that his father's friends were happy and their wives were also happy on account of money not going over pub counters. He told his mum this, and also his findings from the library.

New arrangements came into being. Barbecues became a regular weekend thing. If people happened to carry things back out to their cars later, what of it? And somewhere in a country town, two police officers had a well-lubricated weekend.

Pattern recognized: systems have gaps. Understanding the gaps let you work within them without breaking them.

## Horsing Around

Years later, driving through town with his mate, they unloaded two horses from an old Bedford truck and put them in a yard.

"Shutup, Bonzer." He grabbed the bay's halter. "She'll kick you if you don't knock it off."

The dog stood down and they fitted the tack, checking both saddles methodically. With broad-brimmed hats and faded jeans, in dirty khaki shirts they mounted up and rode in silence through early morning streets. The horses' hooves echoed off shopfronts in the empty streets. Traffic slowed around them, drivers doing double-takes.

Side by side they took up the whole lane. The streets were wide enough—cattle town for more than a century, wide enough for a dray to do a U-turn. Eventually drivers used the very wide streets to drive carefully around the mounted pair, children's faces pressed to windows as they passed.

By the time they reached the police station, a small crowd had gathered. A woman stuck behind them leaned on her horn. His mate gave his mount some invisible signal and the huge creature turned in place, a dainty dance from the beast, and took steps forward. He doffed his hat and leaned down into her window.

"That wasn't terribly smart. If you do that again and he puts a hoof through your radiator, whose fault do you think that would be?"

The young constable who met them at the entrance was already hostile. "You can't just—"

"We require water for our horses," he said formally, keeping his voice level. "And hay, for which we're prepared to pay a shilling per horse."

The constable blinked. "A shilling?"

"Five pence, if you prefer decimal. Current rates for livery in town."

"You're serious."

"Section forty-three of the Transport Operations Act," he continued, making it up entirely. "Any public facility must provide water and temporary shelter for working animals on request. We've been working cattle since dawn and the horses need rest before the ride home."

The constable's face cycled through confusion, suspicion, and resignation. "Wait here."

Twenty minutes later the sergeant emerged with a grin that said he knew exactly what was happening but appreciated the audacity. "There's a trough around back. Help yourselves. And tell your father he raises fine horses—but next time call ahead."

Riding away, his mate asked: "Section forty-three?"

"Probably exists somewhere. Might not apply here."

"And if he'd checked?"

"Then we'd have apologized for the misunderstanding, paid for water we'd already drunk, and learned where the boundaries actually were."

His mate laughed. "You're going to get us arrested one day."

"Not today, though."

Pattern recognized: authority respects confidence. Respectful audacity often gets further than timid compliance. And if you're wrong, apologize and move on.

## Analytical engine

The caravan was cramped after three years of "temporary accommodation." Trixie pinned another sketch to the corkboard—separate buildings clustered around a courtyard.

"Kitchen smells," she said. "I don't want to wake up to last night's curry."

He looked up from his coffee. "And outside is for living anyway. Why box it all up like we're still in the suburbs?"

"Bathhouse separate from sleeping quarters. Workshop over there where noise won't matter. And I want an outdoor kitchen."

"Outdoor kitchen?"

"With a roof. With screens for the flies. Cook outside, eat outside."

"So... an indoor kitchen that's outside."

"Think of it as a next-level barbecue."

He nodded slowly. "It needs louvres. Too much wind blows the heat away."

She started to disagree but he knew she was wrong and tuned her out. He drew a plan—big rectangular pergola, guttering feeding a tank, outer wall of louvres between structural beams. 800mm in from the louvres, another wall of sliding screen panels. Inside that, island benches.

"How do you get in?"

"Oh." He turned a panel of louvres into an outward-opening door on every side but the uphill side. He sketched another version, rectangular with wider roof. Half kitchen, half screened outdoor dining. In a third version, proportions longer and narrower, the table much bigger. The kitchen on the uphill end was still square, and though both kitchen and dining were screened, there was screen between the two—people are careless and flies are quick.

Trixie watched him work through the problem. She'd learned long ago that his first solution was rarely his best, but his fourth or fifth might be workable.

"I like the third one," she said. "But make the kitchen bigger."

He erased, adjusted proportions, redrew. Better.

Pattern recognized: first thought is often wrong. Iterate. Design is conversation between problem and solution, and the problem talks back if you listen.

## Off the beaten track

A time came when he'd had enough. Not the sort to tell others how to live, he just wanted to do his own thing. But they wouldn't piss off and mind their own business. Rules, rules, rules and escalating abuse if you didn't toe the line. Obnoxious and suffocating.

So he left.

They wanted water, elevation, trees. Not so far from a small town that there was nothing, but far from the madding crowd. Eventually they found a valley in the Great Dividing Range where the air was cool and clear.

The town had a post office, red-brick made from local clay pressed by hand and fired on site. There was no K-mart, no Bunnings. Just a sprawling hardware place run by the same family for generations, selling stockfeed and chainsaw parts and barbed wire on huge spools.

But the grandest building was the pub.

The pub had a beer garden. It reeked of smoke, but he approved—not the smoking, but that people were doing it and no one gave them a hard time. He'd smoked for twenty years, continuing mostly because people kept telling him to stop. Eventually they gave up, and one day he saw an ad for a week skiing. That cost the same as his tobacco habit. Choice made. He loved skiing. Finger-wagging and guilt-trips hadn't worked. But when no-one pushed and it was of his own volition, he never smoked again.

Pattern recognized: agency matters more than outcome. Push at people and they dig in. Leave them space and they might surprise you.

There was so much to do. Power came from a trailer covered in solar panels. Data by low-orbit satellite. Expensive compared to suburban fibre, but what price freedom?

They argued about money. She worried for the future. He lived for the moment. He put things beyond argument by buying the mill, a jerk move or manly confidence depending on who you asked. He didn't care. His mistakes were his own and the math was unarguable.

Ten bucks a post times 1250 posts for three kilometres of fence: twelve-and-a-half thousand dollars. The mill was fifteen thousand. And hardwood posts weren't ten bucks, more like thirty. There would be a learning curve, but fence posts were a good way to learn. After that, his dreams of ten-inch beams vaulting overhead were subject only to sweat and imagination.

Oleksiy was good company. His choices weren't the same but they spoke the same language—contempt for authority, love of making. He was generous with help and encouraging. They built an open shed of green timber, then put lumber under it to season, slowly growing mountains of stacked beams. All far too large; Oleksiy's advice was to let them season in large pieces to limit warping, then trim them and make dimensional lumber.

Pattern recognized: good neighbours are worth more than good fences. Though the fence still needed building.

## Before

The fence was finished. Three kilometres of wire and star pickets marking the boundary between what he chose to defend and what the bush could have. Not much—a symbolic line that said "this far, no further"—but symbols mattered.

Two years of work. Two years of learning to build for land where even the rocks were worn and tired. The sun beat down, sneering at his efforts. Sometimes the sky gods threw cricket balls of ice.

Trixie was at the food garden, probably swearing at wallabies. Twenty-five years together and he could still predict her movements. The wallaby war was constant. She'd declared it within a week of arrival and maintained hostilities with impressive dedication. He wondered when she'd realize the best way to get a lettuce back from a wallaby was to eat the wallaby. She saw things raiding her garden. He saw a lunch magnet.

The sound of her voice drifted up—singing some old waiata her grandmother had taught her. One of those rare moments when the valley felt complete. Decades of planning and two years of building converging into something approaching the life they'd imagined.

Or the life he'd imagined. He couldn't quite remember whose idea this had been. Trixie had a way of making his ideas work while letting him think they'd been hers all along.

At the garden's edge, Trixie was wrestling with chickenwire, reinforcing the lower section where something had been digging.

"Wallabies or rabbits?" he asked, keeping his voice neutral.

"Don't start." She didn't look up. "The holes are too small for wallabies."

"We've had this conversation."

"And we'll have it again. Some conversations are permanent." She straightened, turning to face him with that expression he'd learned to read over decades. "How's the fence?"

"Done. Gates need hanging, but the wire's up."

She nodded, wiping sweat from her forehead. "So now what?"

"Now we see if it holds."

"Against wallabies?"

"Against whatever comes."

She studied him with the particular attention she brought to moments that mattered. Twenty-five years of marriage meant she could read between his words, could hear what he didn't say.

"You're expecting something."

"I'm expecting the unexpected," he said. "That's what you do out here."

Pattern recognized: preparation isn't paranoia. It's pattern recognition applied forward. You build the fence before you need it, not after.

Two years out here now. Long enough that routine had settled into something sustainable, short enough that every accomplishment felt like victory. The caravan wasn't meant to be permanent—just shelter while he built something proper. But Trixie had made it work with that particular genius she had for turning cramped spaces into homes.

The path down from the high point wound between ironbarks and blackbutt, bark peeling in long strips. Cicadas started their evening chorus. A kookaburra laughed somewhere off to the east.

He'd withdrawn from civilization after recognizing its fatal patterns. Money and centralism, mutually enabling systems that decoupled benefit from consequences. Egypt, Rome, China, Spain, Britain, America—same pattern. Success → Centralization → Capture → Corruption → Collapse.

The valley was his answer. Not a solution—you couldn't solve civilization's problems by withdrawing. But you could choose not to participate. Build something different. See if humans could organize without the patterns that doomed every complex society.

He'd spent thirty years learning to see patterns. In systems, in authority, in how things worked and how they broke. The ginger beer operation taught him about legal gaps. The horses taught him about authority and confidence. The outdoor kitchen taught him about iteration. The valley itself taught him that agency mattered more than outcome.

Now he needed to see what pattern would emerge when the sky fell.

Because he could feel it coming. Something at the edge of perception, like pressure before a storm. The world was changing. He could read it in news reports, in the way governments moved, in the increasing desperation of centralized systems trying to maintain control as reality pulled away beneath them.

He'd built his fence. Stocked his shed. Learned his skills. Made his preparations.

Not paranoia. Pattern recognition applied forward.

Whatever came next, he'd face it in his valley, on his terms, having chosen his ground long before the fight arrived.

He just hadn't expected aliens to smell like cut grass.

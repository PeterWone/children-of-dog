# Getting Started

"What sort of help can you actually give me?"

> _That depends entirely on your point balance and token allocation. Did you want the technical breakdown?_

"Eventually. For now assume my short-term memory is rubbish and I'll need constant reminding, which will annoy me. What I want is tactical analysis. I'll propose strategies, you critique their effectiveness and dependencies, we work out a practical approach with contingencies."

> _That's not how most Vanguards operate._

"Most plans last about thirty seconds once contact is made. But between engagements you need a framework, not random thrashing about hoping something works."

> _Spoken like someone who's actually been shot at. You know what? I'm going to enjoy working with you. Now, about your public identity—_

"No."

> _I haven't even—_

"Whatever you're about to suggest: no. I don't need a brand, I need to keep my forest from being eaten and my neighbors alive if possible."

> _Your neighbors are scattered across forty square kilometres of valley and you have sixty-nine points remaining. We should discuss priorities._

The suspension creaked as the ute lurched down the last section of driveway toward the creek track. Forest had lived out here long enough that the sound of the forest had become background, but now the silence pressed against his ears. No kookaburras. No whipbirds. Just the diesel and the creak of springs.

"First priority is Trix and the property. Then we see who else needs help."

> _Practical. I'll prepare a tactical overlay._

He pulled up at the caravan. Trix wasn't inside. His stomach dropped before he heard the crack of wood on something that squealed. She was down by the garden, his old cricket bat in both hands, facing down three dog-sized things that were methodically eating her herb garden.

"Autumn, another Hummingbird."

The pistol appeared in his hand. Two shots, two down. The third spun toward him and he put one through the centre mass. Trix was breathing hard, bat still raised.

"Here." Forest held out the pistol. "Tap the side for the laser dot. It's disposable, so when it's empty just drop it."

She took it, hands steadier than he expected. "How many more are there?"

"Lots. Your citrus trees by the high creek—they'll go for those next. Anything fruiting or flowering draws them like flies."

"Then go." She pointed the Hummingbird at the ground, finger off the trigger. Good habits die hard. "I'll defend here."

"You'll run out of ammunition."

"Then I'll use the bat."

> _She's either very brave or very stubborn._

"Both," Forest muttered. Louder: "Autumn, can we secure a hardened shelter? Something that'll keep her safe if things get serious. Food, water, air filtration, the works."

> _A proper refuge with independent power, supplies, and emergency exit capability runs 120 points. That drops you to negative fifty-one._

"I'm good for it. Put it down the slope from the caravan, somewhere with good drainage."

The air shimmered and something appeared below the house. Not the steel box Forest had imagined—this looked like a small timber cottage, oiled cedar with proper hinges. Too nice by half.

> _If you're going to save someone's life, do it with style._

"When things get hairy, get inside that. It locks from inside, you can open it again after, and there's supplies for at least a week."

Trix stared at it. "That's not— How did—"

"Space magic. I'll explain later." Forest checked the Hummingbird's charge. "Autumn, give her two more of these. Show her how to check remaining shots."

Two more pistols appeared on the caravan steps, and Autumn's voice came through the outdoor speakers—Forest hadn't known she could do that. The explanation was crisp and practical: charge indicators, how to switch weapons when one depleted, where to aim for small targets.

> _You have negative ninety-six points. Start killing things._

The citrus trees were four hundred metres upslope, chickenwire cages around star pickets keeping wallabies out. The wire was intact but something was working at the bases of the trees, roots exposed, bark stripped. Five of them, same dog-sized species, too focused on feeding to notice Forest until he was twenty metres away.

The Hummingbird made satisfying little phut sounds. Five shots, five down. Almost disappointingly easy.

> _Don't get cocky. You've killed the stupid ones._

Movement in the understory. Forest froze, trying to identify—

The squealing hit first. A sow, maybe four hundred kilos, crashing through the lantana with five of the aliens in panicked flight ahead of her. One clutched a dead piglet.

Forest went up the nearest bloodwood like he was sixteen again. Sows don't climb, but they do hold grudges, and this one was ready to murder everything in a hundred-metre radius.

She stopped below, looking for something to kill. The aliens kept running. Smart choice.

"How many points was that?"

> _You're at negative eighty-one. We need bigger targets._

"What about a recon drone? If I'm hunting blind—"

> _After you're back in the black. Keep moving._

Forest worked through the property systematically, Autumn marking locations as he cleared them. The pattern was obvious: they went for anything lush, anything cultivated. Native bush they mostly ignored—the eucalypts and wattles were too toxic, too low in nutrients. Good. That meant the forest itself might survive even if the Antithesis won.

Small comfort.

> _You're positive seventeen points. We should check on your other neighbors._

"Oleksiy's closest. He's—"

> _Armed, capable, and has functional bunker mentality. The other direction._

"Janna." The nursery. Twenty thousand plants in shadecloth houses, irrigation on a timer, her whole livelihood in one spot. "Right."

It took thirty minutes to reach her driveway, mostly because Forest detoured around a gully full of something he didn't recognize and didn't want to meet yet. When he crested the rise, the silence was total.

The shadecloth was gone. Not torn down—gone. Eaten, presumably. The star pickets stood naked, wire traces on the ground, and not a single plant remained. Her cabin was timber-framed, struc pine because it's cheap. They'd eaten the frame. The roof had collapsed into the space where walls used to be, fibro sheets cracked and twisted, gutters bent like aluminum foil.

Forest stopped walking.

"Autumn."

> _I know._

The irrigation tanks were twenty thousand litres each, corrugated steel, up on ten-metre stands. Vines trailed from the access hatches. Not lantana—these were grey-green, wrong texture, moving slightly in still air.

"Is she...?"

> _I can't tell from here. Do you want me to—_

"No." Forest started walking again. "Grenades?"

> _Three points each._

"Give me three."

They appeared in his hands one at a time, simple spheres with pins. Forest pulled the first pin, lobbed it underhand toward the nearest tank. The spoon flew free with a bright spang and he was already moving back—

WHAM.

The tank ruptured, water and shredded vine spraying out. Things boiled out of the split seam, small and fast, heading straight for him. Forest pulled the second pin, counted two, threw it into the mass.

WHAM.

The third went into the far tank while they were still reforming. That one actually tumbled into the hatch, and when it went off the entire tank bulged, seams splitting, water pouring out in sheets.

Nothing else moved.

Forest waited. Still nothing.

"I need something for cleanup. Something that'll—"

> _Burn it?_

"Burn it."

> _Incendiary grenade, five points. How many?_

"One for now."

Forest walked to where the cabin used to be, close enough to see inside the wreckage. The bed frame was steel, still intact. Everything else was gone. No body. Maybe she'd gotten out, gone to neighbors, wasn't home when—

Something white in the wreckage. Bone. Femur, by the size.

Forest stopped looking.

"Autumn."

> _I see it._

"The incendiary."

> _Are you—_

"She'd want a proper fire. Better than rotting in the wreckage."

The grenade appeared. Forest pulled the pin, set it carefully in the center of the collapse, and walked away. Behind him, the whump of ignition, then the crackle of fire finding fibro and dried timber and beginning to properly burn.

By the time Forest was back at the driveway the smoke was rising black and thick. The old hardwood would burn for hours, hot enough to reduce anything organic to ash. No gravestone, no words. Just smoke rising into the empty sky.

> _I'm sorry._

"Yeah."

They walked back toward home in silence. After a while, Autumn spoke again.

> _You're at thirty-eight points. We should talk about defensive equipment._

"What do I need?"

> _Armor, for starters. Nothing heavy—you need to move through bush. Impact-resistant jacket, reinforced where major arteries run. Fifty points._

"Done."

> _Better weapons. The Hummingbird is adequate for small targets, but you need something with stopping power. What's your preference—projectile or energy?_

"Projectile. Ammunition logistics are a problem but energy weapons that don't explode when dropped in creeks seem expensive."

> _Practical. A basic combat rifle, reliable action, self-contained magazines—forty points._

"What's the alternative?"

> _You tell me. You're the one who understands field logistics._

Fair point. "Fine. The rifle. What else?"

> _Tactical visor. You're operating in heavy bush with limited visibility. I can provide overlay data, threat tracking, navigation—but you need display hardware._

"Implants?"

> _I know you don't do implants. A full-face visor with integrated systems runs thirty-five points. Polarized, impact-resistant, air filtration, communication suite, and enough sensor integration to keep you alive._

"How much is just the sensors without the fancy housing?"

> _You want the protection. Trust me._

"Fine. The visor."

It appeared in his hand, lighter than Forest expected. Motorcycle-helmet form factor, but the interior was a seamless curve of something that definitely wasn't plastic. He pulled it on.

The world blazed into focus. Not just sharper—layered. Threat indicators, distance markers, a compass bearing across the top, battery reserves for every weapon he carried. His heart rate in the corner, steady at sixty-eight. A small indicator showed Trix's position at the caravan, marked as "allied civilian."

"This is—" Forest stopped. "This is actually useful."

> _I know it's hard for you to admit you like things, but try._

"Can you do thermal?"

> _And electromagnetic, and motion tracking, and about six other sensor modes you don't have the background to interpret yet. I'll feed you the relevant data._

Forest turned slowly, watching the overlay track his movement. Distance markers updated smoothly, threat assessment flickered through probable targets in the middle distance. Nothing close. Nothing immediate.

"How much am I in the hole now?"

> _Ninety-two points. But your survival odds just improved significantly. Shall we continue the patrol?_

Forest thought about Janna's place burning behind them. The empty forest. Trix alone at the caravan with three disposable pistols and a cricket bat.

"No. We're setting a perimeter. Show me where we need sensors, where the approaches are, what I can actually defend."

> _Now you're thinking like a Vanguard._

"I'm thinking like someone who doesn't want to bury any more neighbors."

Autumn didn't answer, but the tactical display bloomed with markers, threat assessments, defensive positions, fields of fire. A small diamond appeared on the compass at the top of his vision—home, with the range updating as he moved.

Forest had wanted navigation like this since he was fourteen, playing games where you never got lost, where you always knew which direction to go. Out here, in forty square kilometres of bush that all looked the same, where tracks disappeared in lantana and landmarks were just more gum trees—he'd gotten lost more times than he could count.

Not anymore.

"Thank you, Autumn."

> _You're welcome._

Forest started walking, planning, calculating what he could hold and what he'd have to let burn.

Behind them, smoke still rose from Janna's pyre. The kookaburras stayed silent.

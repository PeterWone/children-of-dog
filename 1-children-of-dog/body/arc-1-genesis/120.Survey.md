# Survey

Two days after the delegation left, Doctor Singh arrived in a battered four-wheel drive that looked more at home on a mining site than a government motor pool. Forest asked, and it turned out that she _had_ a shiny motor pool vehicle, and trusted it not at all. Far too many gadgets to take it far from a workshop. Instead she used the Landcruiser she bought cheap in 2010, a 2008 Series 100, the last of the unbreakables. She picked it up cheap while they were still easy to find and the market hadn't realised what a bad idea all the pollution control stuff was. Two rebuilds and a new engine later it was still gadget-free and never missed a beat. She was less than thirty seconds into that story when he spotted the high-lift jack, the winch and the bundle of star pickets complete with picket hammer and puller. And she had _two_ spares. He took an instant shine to her. 


He watched her navigate the track to his clearing with something approaching approval. She stopped at the water crossing, walked three quarters the way across, looked satisfied and just drove through it at about 15km/h, like everyone who lived there. 

"Dr. Singh." He offered his hand, noting the firm grip and calloused palm that spoke of hands-on fieldwork rather than laboratory theory.

"Amanda, please. The doctorate was environmental science, but most of my work's been in remediation projects. Spent three years in the Northern Territory working mine sites." She surveyed the clearing with the methodical attention of someone cataloguing logistics. "This is going to be more complicated than they think."

"Always is." He appreciated directness. "Tea?"

Over tea in the shade of his caravan, Amanda laid out the scope of the problem with refreshing honesty. The delegation had envisioned a small field station—a few researchers, basic equipment, data collection focused on the unique characteristics of Australian flora in resisting antithesis incursion. What Autumn actually needed was considerably more ambitious: comprehensive instrumentation of the entire valley, network infrastructure capable of handling massive data flows, laboratory facilities for analysis, accommodation for rotating teams of specialists.

"The others are thinking university field trip," Amanda explained, her weathered face creasing with concern. "A couple of demountables, some sensor equipment, weekly visits from town. But if what your AI described is accurate, this isn't a weekly visit, it's permanent on-site presence. We're going to need living quarters, labs, lockups, power and waste management. There'll be too many of us for a shit-pit. And all of it has to work reliably in the middle of nowhere."

He appreciated her grasp of reality. "What do you need?"

"First? A proper site survey. We need to find a location that's defensible, accessible enough for regular supply runs, has water access, and won't flood in the wet season. Second, we need to understand what's actually here—not just the ecology, but existing infrastructure, property boundaries, neighbor relations. Third, we need to figure out what you're willing to tolerate, because this is your home and we're the intruders."

The honesty was unexpected and welcome. He found himself warming to the practical scientist who understood that successful research required functional logistics before theoretical brilliance.

"Autumn, can you put together a topo map of the valley with property boundaries, water features, and elevation data?"

> _Already done. Transmitting to Dr. Singh's tablet._

Amanda's eyes widened as her field tablet chimed with incoming data. The map that appeared was considerably more detailed than anything government agencies had provided, showing not just terrain but geological composition, drainage patterns, existing tracks, and even the locations of various antithesis incursions color-coded by type and severity.

"This is... this is extraordinary work." Amanda's professional composure cracked slightly as she scrolled through layers of data that would have taken her team weeks to compile. "It's _layered._ You've gone down four metres! How?"

"Autumn takes her work seriously," he said dryly. "What do you think?"

Amanda studied the map with the focused intensity of someone solving a puzzle. Her finger traced elevation contours, paused at water features, circled back to examine access routes. He watched her work, impressed by the systematic approach that prioritized practical concerns over theoretical elegance.

"Here." She pointed to a location roughly halfway down the valley, where a natural terrace offered flat ground elevated above the creek. "Good drainage, defendable position with clear sightlines, close enough to the creek for water access but high enough to avoid flooding. The granite outcrop behind provides natural protection. And it's central to the valley, which matters for sensor coverage."

He studied the location, mentally cataloguing distances and approaches. "That's Gerry's property. The deal's already been struck, so we're good there."

"Gerry?"

"Quiet Polish bloke, keeps to himself mostly. Trix organised it. Dr. Singh - hey, that's your name, are you, um-"

"No. It's a common name." 

"OK. Well, he made a bloody good move when he cut the bullshit and levelled with Gerry. That mattered more than the offer. People are like that round here."

Amanda made notes. "We'll need to establish good relations with all the neighbors. This project will impact everyone in the valley."

The afternoon was spent walking the valley, Amanda asking questions that revealed both practical experience and genuine respect for the land and the people on it. She understood that successful long-term research required integration with the existing community, not imposition upon it. Her questions about property access, existing agreements, local customs, and neighbor concerns demonstrated someone who'd learned the hard way that ignoring social infrastructure led to failed projects regardless of scientific merit.

Trix joined them for the afternoon tour. He understood the practical aspects of valley life but Trix knew who was doing what and why. The people version, not the machinery version. She explained which neighbors would welcome scientific presence, who would be suspicious, and laid out a few landmines to avoid.

"Janna's lost everything recently," Trix explained as they paused near the property where he had found the nurse practitioner's compound destroyed. "But she's rebuilding. Having researchers nearby might comfort her."

"What does she do?"

"She _was_ running a nursery til the antithesis ate it. Now she mostly frets about debt."

"Oh! Well then, that I can _fix_. Local contractors are preferred. We're going to need grounds and gardens."

"Nearest proper town is about ninety minutes on good roads," he said. "But we're not helpless. Janna's a nurse practitioner, Oleksiy's a builder, I've got fabrication capabilities through Autumn, Trix runs hospitality. The Macintyres south of here raise cattle, we get our beef and milk from them. We're fairly self-sufficient, which is why most of us chose to live out here."

"Works for me," said Amanda. "Local contractors again."

The practical scientist was thinking like someone who understood that successful research happened within social contexts, not despite them. He found himself cautiously optimistic about the project's prospects, if the rest of them were anything like her. And if they weren't, he would put quiet words in local ears until she mysteriously found herself in charge of everything because when she was, barriers vanished.

As the sun angled toward late afternoon, they returned to his clearing. Amanda seemed satisfied with the survey results, her field notebook filled with observations and preliminary sketches.

"The site location is solid," she said, reviewing her notes. "Gerry's property is ideal. Central, good terrain, defensible. And from what you've described, the valley has enough local expertise to support us without external supply chains."

"We're stubborn about self-sufficiency," he agreed. "It's why most people live out here."

As Amanda prepared to leave, promising to return with preliminary plans within the week, he reflected on the strange currents that were transforming his quiet valley. The delegation had seen opportunity for advancement and profit. Amanda saw logistics and community integration. The question was whether her practical approach could survive the bureaucratic reality that would inevitably follow.

> _That went better than expected._ 

Amanda's vehicle rumbled down the track.

"She's practical," he replied. "If she can maintain that and manage all the egos heading our way, we might get something done."

> _And if she can't?_

He watched the dust settle from Amanda's departure. A marsh fly bit him and he killed it with a slap. The not-silence fell, chirriping, catcalling, buzzing.

"Then we'll have expensive science happening in the middle of chaos, and probably learn more about human nature than antithesis resistance."

In the distance, a whipbird called, indifferent to human folly.

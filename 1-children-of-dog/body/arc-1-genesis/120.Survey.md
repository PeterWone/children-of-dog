Dr. Amanda Singh was the first to arrive, two days after the delegation's visit. She came alone in a battered four-wheel drive that looked more at home on a mining site than in a government motor pool, her field gear arranged with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd spent considerable time in environments that didn't forgive mistakes.

Forest watched her navigate the track to his clearing with something approaching approval. Unlike the delegation's careful convoy, Singh drove with the confidence of someone who understood that cautious speed was safer than tentative hesitation. When she emerged from the vehicle, her khakis were already dusty, and she carried herself with the pragmatic posture of someone who'd learned to expect discomfort.

"Dr. Singh." Forest offered his hand, noting the firm grip and calloused palm that spoke of hands-on fieldwork rather than laboratory theory.

"Amanda, please. The doctorate was environmental science, but most of my work's been in remediation projects. Spent three years in the Northern Territory working mine sites." She surveyed the clearing with the methodical attention of someone cataloguing logistics. "This is going to be more complicated than they think."

"They usually are." Forest appreciated directness. "Tea?"

Over tea in the shade of Forest's van, Amanda laid out the scope of the problem with refreshing honesty. The delegation had envisioned a small field station—a few researchers, basic equipment, data collection focused on the unique characteristics of Australian flora in resisting antithesis incursion. What Autumn actually needed was considerably more ambitious: comprehensive instrumentation of the entire valley, network infrastructure capable of handling massive data flows, laboratory facilities for analysis, accommodation for rotating teams of specialists.

"The others are thinking university field trip," Amanda explained, her weathered face creasing with concern. "A couple of demountables, some sensor equipment, weekly visits from town. But if what your AI described is accurate, we're talking about permanent infrastructure. Living quarters, laboratories, secure storage, power generation, waste management. And all of it has to work reliably in the middle of nowhere."

Forest appreciated her grasp of reality. "What do you need?"

"First? A proper site survey. We need to find a location that's defensible, accessible enough for regular supply runs, has water access, and won't flood in the wet season. Second, we need to understand what's actually here—not just the ecology, but existing infrastructure, property boundaries, neighbor relations. Third, we need to figure out what you're willing to tolerate, because this is your home and we're the intruders."

The honesty was unexpected and welcome. Forest found himself warming to the practical scientist who understood that successful research required functional logistics before theoretical brilliance.

"Autumn, can you put together a topographical map of the valley with property boundaries, water features, and elevation data?"

> _Already done. Transmitting to Dr. Singh's tablet._

Amanda's eyes widened as her field tablet chimed with incoming data. The map that appeared was considerably more detailed than anything government agencies had provided, showing not just terrain but geological composition, drainage patterns, existing tracks, and even the locations of various antithesis incursions color-coded by type and severity.

"This is... this is extraordinary work." Amanda's professional composure cracked slightly as she scrolled through layers of data that would have taken her team weeks to compile. "The geological detail alone—"

"Autumn takes her work seriously," Forest said dryly. "What do you think?"

Amanda studied the map with the focused intensity of someone solving a particularly complex puzzle. Her finger traced elevation contours, paused at water features, circled back to examine access routes. Forest watched her work, impressed by the systematic approach that prioritized practical concerns over theoretical elegance.

"Here." She pointed to a location roughly halfway down the valley, where a natural terrace offered flat ground elevated above the creek. "Good drainage, defendable position with clear sightlines, close enough to the creek for water access but high enough to avoid flooding. The granite outcrop behind provides natural protection. And it's central to the valley, which matters for sensor coverage."

Forest studied the location, mentally cataloguing distances and approaches. "That's Gerry's property. The deal's already been struck, so we're good there."

"Gerry?"

"Quiet Polish bloke, keeps to himself mostly. Trix helped negotiate the lease. Dr. Singh made a bloody good move when he cut the bullshit and levelled with Gerry. He cared more about that than the money. People are like that round here."

Amanda made notes with the efficient shorthand of experienced fieldwork. "We'll need to establish good relations with all the neighbors. This project will impact everyone in the valley."

The afternoon was spent walking the valley, Amanda asking questions that revealed both practical experience and genuine respect for the land. She understood that successful long-term research required integration with the existing community, not imposition upon it. Her questions about property access, existing agreements, local customs, and neighbor concerns demonstrated someone who'd learned the hard way that ignoring social infrastructure led to failed projects regardless of scientific merit.

Trix joined them for the afternoon tour, her presence adding valuable perspective on community dynamics. While Forest understood the practical aspects of valley life, Trix grasped the social networks that made the community function. She explained which neighbors would welcome scientific presence, which would be suspicious, and which would need careful handling.

"Janna's lost everything recently," Trix explained as they paused near the property where Forest had found the nurse practitioner's compound destroyed. "But she's rebuilding. Having researchers nearby might comfort her—means there's attention being paid, resources available if things go wrong again."

Amanda nodded, absorbing the information with the attention of someone who understood that community buy-in could make or break a project. "What about supplies? There's no town nearby, and the track is barely passable."

"Nearest proper town is about ninety minutes on good roads," Forest said. "But we're not helpless. Janna's a nurse practitioner, Oleksiy's a builder, I've got fabrication capabilities through Autumn, Trix runs hospitality. The Macintyres south of here raise cattle. We're fairly self-sufficient, which is why most of us chose to live out here."

"That could actually work in our favor," Amanda mused. "If we can integrate with local capabilities rather than trying to establish everything independently, we reduce our logistical footprint and build better community relations."

The practical scientist was thinking like someone who understood that successful research happened within social contexts, not despite them. Forest found himself cautiously optimistic about the project's prospects, provided Amanda's pragmatic approach wasn't overwhelmed by the academic egos and corporate agendas that would inevitably follow.

As the sun angled toward late afternoon, they returned to Forest's clearing. Amanda seemed satisfied with the survey results, her field notebook filled with observations and preliminary sketches.

"The site location is solid," she said, reviewing her notes. "Gerry's property is ideal—central position, good terrain, defensible. And from what you've described, the valley has enough local expertise to support the project without creating dependency on external supply chains."

"We're stubborn about self-sufficiency," Forest agreed. "It's why most people live out here."

As Amanda prepared to leave, promising to return with preliminary plans within the week, Forest reflected on the strange currents that were transforming his quiet valley. The delegation had seen opportunity for advancement and profit. Amanda saw logistics and community integration. The question was whether her practical approach could survive the bureaucratic reality that would inevitably follow.

> _That went better than expected,_ Autumn observed as Amanda's vehicle rumbled down the track.

"She's practical," Forest replied. "Understands that research happens in the real world, not theoretical perfection. If she can maintain that perspective while managing all the egos heading our way, we might actually accomplish something useful."

> _And if she can't?_

Forest watched the dust settle from Amanda's departure, the eucalyptus already reclaiming the quiet his valley had known before strangers arrived.

"Then we'll have expensive science happening in the middle of chaos, and probably learn more about human nature than antithesis resistance."

In the distance, a whipbird called its distinctive note, and the bush returned to the business of being itself—indifferent to human plans and the complications they inevitably attracted.

**Class I Medical Utilities Unlocked!**  
**Points Reduced to: 80**

The text appeared in his vision like someone editing his eyeballs. Forest had the distinct impression he should be panicking, but shock and blood loss were making everything feel slightly unreal. Distant. Like watching someone else's life through dirty glass.

> _Good! Now, WoundStop. Trauma sealant. Five points. Keeps you from dying long enough to think about your life choices. Authorize?_

"Do it," Forest wheezed.

A box materialized on the ground next to him. Just appeared. Turkey baster mated with a medical syringe, plastic and improbable.

"How—"

> _Protector technology. Magic by any reasonable standard. Now use it before your wife comes out and sees you've bled all over her vegetables._

Forest grabbed the WoundStop. His fingers didn't work properly. The box slipped, skittered away on the slick green blood coating everything. He lunged for it, and pain flared white-hot in his leg. The grey tunnel closed tighter.

> _Easy! I didn't keep you alive this long just to have you kill yourself reaching for a box. Here._

Something shifted. The box rotated, slid across the ground on its own, bumped against his good hand. Forest stared at it, then at the dead alien still pinning his other arm, then at the cut-grass smell that wouldn't go away.

"I'm definitely hallucinating."

> _You keep saying that. Do you always argue with your hallucinations, or am I special?_

The caravan door opened. Trix emerged clutching antiseptic and cotton wool, saw him pinned under thirty kilos of dead alien, and her expression cycled from worry to rage in half a second.

"WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO 'I'M FINE'?!"

She dropped beside him, assessing damage with the practiced efficiency of someone who'd dealt with farm accidents. Her hands moved fast, checking pulse, examining wounds, not touching anything that might bleed worse.

"Need to get this thing's jaw off my arm," Forest managed. His voice sounded wrong. Too far away.

Trix grabbed his machete—when had he dropped that?—and worked the blade between alien teeth and his forearm. Precise. Brutal. The jaws cracked open. His arm came free, and he could see bone through the torn meat.

"Oh," he said. "That's not ideal."

"Shock," Trix said flatly. She snatched the WoundStop from his hand. "What is this?"

> _Instructions on the side. She's clever, she'll work it out. Unlike some people who argue about whether they're hallucinating while bleeding to death._

"Use it," Forest said. "Stops bleeding. I think."

Trix read the instructions, made a disgusted noise, and jammed the applicator into his shredded forearm. Something cold and gritty flooded the wound. Forest hissed. Then the pain just... stopped. Faded to a distant ache, like it was happening to someone else.

"What the fuck is this made of?" Trix demanded.

"Alien technology," Forest said. "I'm a Vanguard now."

She stared at him. "You hit your head."

"That's what I thought. But the voice says no."

"The voice."

"In my head. She's very sarcastic."

> _I resemble that remark._

Trix's expression suggested she was reconsidering several life choices, possibly including marriage. But she moved to his leg, peeled back the shredded orange chaps, and applied more WoundStop. White rubbery sealant over torn muscle. The pain receding like a tide going out.

"Your arse too," she said.

"What?"

"That thing bit you on the arse. Don't move."

Against all common sense and human dignity, Trix was now pouring antiseptic directly onto his bleeding backside. He made sounds that were not words.

> _Your wife is terrifying. I approve._

"Why do you sound like Jen Taylor?" he gasped, desperate for any distraction.

> _I know all about you, Chief. You were already taking advice from the voice in your helmet._

"I don't have a helmet."

> _Not yet._

Trix stepped back, surveying her work with the critical eye of someone evaluating dodgy fence posts. "Right. Aliens. Voice in your head. Magic healing paste. Am I drunk?"

"If you are, I'm drunk too." Forest tested his leg. It held. The pain was there but manageable, like a deep bruise rather than shredded muscle. The WoundStop flexed when he moved, white and rubbery against red meat. "How long was I down?"

"Five minutes. Maybe less." Trix looked at the dead aliens, then at the forest beyond, then back at him. "Are there more?"

> _Yes. Brian's property, about two kilometres south. Smoke suggests he's handling it, but 'handling it' and 'surviving it' are different things._

"Brian's place," Forest said. "The voice says there's more down there."

"The _voice_."

"Her name's..." He paused. "What's your name again?"

> _Myxoma. And before you ask, yes, like the rabbit disease. I wasn't consulted._

"Myxoma. Like the rabbit plague."

Trix's expression suggested she was having serious doubts about his mental state, which was fair because so was he. But the dead aliens were real. The WoundStop was real. The green text floating in his vision showing **Points: 75** was... probably real.

"Right," Trix said slowly. She handed him his machete, grip first. "We're getting in the ute and going to Brian's. You're going to explain everything on the way. And if this is a concussion dream, I'm going to be very annoyed."

> _She's practical. I like her. Now, about those points—Brian probably needs help, and you're not exactly combat-ready. Shall we discuss purchasing a real weapon instead of a chainsaw?_

Forest looked at the dead aliens. At his arm, sealed with white rubber that shouldn't exist. At Trix, who was already heading for the ute with the particular determined stride that meant arguing was futile.

"Yes," he said to the voice. "Let's discuss weapons."

> _Finally. Now we're getting somewhere._

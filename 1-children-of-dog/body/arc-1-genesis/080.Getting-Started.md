# Getting Started

> "Plans are worthless, but planning is everything."  
> &mdash; Dwight D. Eisenhower

---

"What can you actually give me?"

> _Depends on points and tokens. Want the breakdown?_

"Later. Assume my memory's shit and constant reminding pisses me off. I want tactical analysis. I propose, you critique, we work out something practical."

> _Not how most Vanguards operate._

"Most plans last thirty seconds. Still need a framework between fights."

> _Spoken like someone who's been shot at. I'm going to enjoy this. Now, about your public identity—_

"No."

> _I haven't—_

"Whatever you're suggesting: no. I need my forest alive and my neighbors breathing."

> _Neighbors scattered across forty kilometres. Sixty-nine points. Priorities._

The ute lurched down the drive. He'd lived here long enough that forest sound was background—but now silence pressed at his ears. No kookaburras. No whipbirds. Just diesel and creaking springs.

"Trix first. Property. Then who else needs help."

> _Practical. Preparing tactical overlay._

He pulled up at the caravan. Trix wasn't inside. Stomach dropped before he heard wood crack on something squealing. Garden. His cricket bat in her hands. Three dog-sized things methodically eating her herbs.

"Autumn. Hummingbird."

A pistol appeared. Two shots, two down. The third spun when he hit it center mass. Trix was breathing hard, bat raised.

"Here." He offered the pistol. "Laser's on the side. Disposable. Empty means drop it."

She took it. Steadier than expected. "How many more?"

"Lots. Citrus by the high creek—they'll hit that next. Anything fruiting."

"Then go." The Hummingbird was pointed down and her finger was off the trigger. Good habits. "I'll hold here."

"You'll run dry."

"I have this." She hefted the cricket bat.

> _Is she brave or stubborn?_

"Both." Then louder: "Autumn. I want a hardened shelter to keep her safe when it gets serious. Food, water, air, everything."

> _Aproper refuge with independent power and an emergency exit is 120 points. You have sixty-nine._

"Give me what sixty-nine gets."

> _That's everything. You'll be—_

"Broke. Do it. Below the caravan, good drainage."

Air shimmered and a reinforced container appeared. It had a solid door and ventilation on top.

> _Scaled for budget. Food, water, air, power. Five days, one person. You have no points._

He ignored Autumn's admonishment, looking at Trixie. "When things get hairy, get inside and lock yourself in. You have supplies for a Week."

Trixie stared. "How—"

"Space magic. Later." He checked the Hummingbird's rounds. "Autumn, give her two more Hummingbirds. Can you show her the counter?"

> _Can't._

"What?"

> _Zero points. No credit. I did warn you._

Cold in his stomach. He'd bought Trix's safety but left himself nothing to work with. Short-sighted. Exactly what she managed his finances to prevent.

"Right." He looked at Trixie. "One pistol and the bat. Every shot counts. Back soon."

"Where are you going?"

"Into town to get some gear."

The ute didn't like the speed he went down the valley track, suspension protesting and the vehicle lurching and bouncing. The servo would have closed three hours ago when incursions started, but Brian lived above his hardware store. If he was lucky, the old bastard was still alive.

Town was deserted. Not evacuated, the streets were empty, like everyone stepped inside at once. No bodies, no damage. Just silence and tension crawling his skin.

Brian's hardware was locked but the shop lights were all on. He banged on the glass.

"Brian! You there?"

A familiar face appeared at the window, old as stars, and suspicious. The door cracked and suspicion was replaced by recognition and concern.

"You armed?"

"Yeah. Low ammo. You?"

"Rifle. What do you need?"

"Chainsaw. Chaps. Fuel. Two-stroke oil and a mixer." He pulled cash from his wallet. They didn't do EFTPOS. What he did with his money was none of the government's business. "Double."

"Keep it. We're past that." Brian vanished into the depths of his shop, returning with a Stihl MS661. Professional, near-new. He also brought orange chaps, certified, and a Jerry can. "I imagine you know how to sharpen a chain?"

"Felled hundreds of trees. I use a bench-mounted sharpener."

"Here, not as good but portable." It was a sharpening kit. "And these." First aid—tourniquets, pressure bandages. "You're bleeding."

He looked down to discover hes jeans soaked dark on one thigh. "Spike earlier. Didn't notice."

"Shock." Brian grabbed his arm. Strong for seventy-plus. "Sit. Now."

"No time—"

"No time to bleed out either. Sit."

He sat. Brian cut the fabric away, exposing a puncture wound. It wasn't deep but it was messy. The old man cleaned and packed it, wrapping it tight. He'd been a medic in Vietnam. It wasn't something he talked about.

"You'll get there. Try to be less of a twit, this time: don't do it alone."

"Not alone."

"Missus?"

"In a shelter."

"Bring her to town. Safer here."

"She won't leave."

Brian grunted. He knew that kind of stubborn. "Keep your head down and shoot straight."

They heaved the gear into the ute. This chainsaw was heavier than his cheap chinese unit. Or he was tired. His leg throbbed now Brian had made him notice.

"Brian. Thanks."

"Thank me by surviving." A pause. "Those things are in town. Don't let them reach the shops. There's sixty people in the RSL. They'll come for food."

"Spread the word."

"Righto."

The drive back took much longer. Vision fuzzed about the edges. He focussed on road. Blood loss was making him light-headed. Shock. Stress.

He rolled up to the caravan in its clearing. Trixie stood guard, Hummingbird ready, watching the tree line. She stopped doing that and ran up when she saw him.

"You're hurt." She said it like an accusation.

"Brian patched me up. How many?"

"Three. Small. The shelter works, I tried it out." She glared at the chainsaw. "That's not alien."

"No."

"You spent everything on me."

"Yep."

Quiet moment. "Idiot."

"Heard that already."

> _Chief. Check the tray. Behind the chainsaw._

He looked. There were boxes. Very different, very familiar. He popped one open. A lumber jacket, armoured and flexible. A tactical visor. A very mundane yet well made rifle, with weird disposable-looking magazines. _Grenades._ Full combat loadout.

"What the hell?"

> _I make things. Sometimes I leave them lying around. It's not my fault if someone finds them useful._

"Autumn—"

> _No credit, remember? I hope you don't mind if I keep my stuff in your vehicle._

He stared. "This is—"

> _A technicality. Lodge a complaint._

Trixie looked between boxes and him. "Your alien's a bureaucratic ninja."

> _She's fun and smart. I'm not sure you deserve either of us._

"Can you do this? Without trouble?"

> _Do what? I don't mind you borrowing my stuff but if you break it there will be words._

Pulling armor out, he tried it and found a perfect fit. "You measured me."

> _I measure everything. Suit up before something eats you. We have a valley to defend. I'd rather not train new a Vanguard from scratch. Good candidates are rare. Not all survive the wafer implant, and most of you get eaten in the first ten minutes._

"Wonderful, I feel so cared for."

The citrus grove was four hundred metres upslope. Surrounded by chickenwire, star pickets, it was intended to wallaby-proof and wasn't, which meant it also wasn't space-monster-proof. There was something at the tree bases. Roots were exposed, bark stripped. Five dog-sized things were busy feeding. He didn't spot them till twenty metres, so they scared the shit out of him when he finally saw them.

The Hummingbird made satisfying phut sounds. Five shots, five down. Disappointingly easy.

> _Don't get cocky. You've killed the stupid ones._

Movement in understory made him freeze. Wallaby-sized, hunched shapes eating exposed roots.

> _Fours. Pack hunters. Stop grinding points on the easy ones. Move._

"Suggestions?"

> _Use the grenades. Two Fours aren't—_

Squealing from below, pig-sized. A _lot_ of pig. Tusks flashing in failing light. Three big units, heading downhill.

> _Fives. Those are Fives. Chief, get clear._

He ran. Slipped on wet leaves, caught himself. The pig-things were faster but they weren't running from him, they were running at the caravan.

At Trix.

Thirty metres between them and his wife. He wasn't going to make it.

First shot center mass on the leader. Down. Second shot wing hit. The third stumbled and he missed.

Trix fired. Laser dot on pig-thing's head. The Hummingbird made a lazy _phut_ and the thing's head exploded.

The third made it to the clearing before he tagged it. It fell and rolled, bleeding. Trix approached, bat raised overhead, two-handed like a boundary strike. Its skull collapsed with a wet crunch.

She looked up at him, breathing hard and spattered with gore. "How many more?"

"Lots."

"I need a bigger bat."

> _I like her._

"She's alright, I suppose."

They took the long way back to the citrus grove, approaching quietly from downwind. A wallaby-sized pair was still demolishing the saplings. The heft of a grenade wasn't something he'd felt ever. Back in the corps his job was all about codes and radios, they spent precious little time on the range and none at all on other skills of the infantry, but he still knew to pull the pin, release the spoon, count to three and throw. He used a swinging underhand lob, very mindful of the implicatios of losing his grip and having it land close.

One landed perfectly, right among them. The second went long but apparently close enough for government work. Flash-crack. One vaporized. The other fountained gore back at them.

> _Effectiveness over aesthetics. Plus side: eighty points._

"From?"

> _Five Fives, twelve Threes, couple Fours. Good morning's work._

"Not morning."

> _Somewhere it is. Optimism, Chief._

Chainsaw time. He cut the mangled trees back, then piled up the Antithesis bodies. He was going to cut them up and scatter the pieces, but Autumn explained that this was the worst thing he could do short of potting mix and water. He bought a thing called a Resonator, and learnt how to use it.

Eventually it was done and he Walked the boundary. There were More signs. Digging near the dam. Tree damage by the machinery shed. Root exposure at orchard border. Systematic and probing.

> _They're feeling the place out. Learning._

"So'm I."

Dusk settled purple as the sun melted and dripped of the edge of the world. The temperature was dropping but it wouldn't get cold. Not this time of year. 

Trix had a hurricane lamp lit at the caravan, yellow and bright in the gathering dark.

She had her own pile, dragged away from the caravan, and she was making tea on camp stove. Two mugs.

"Well?"

"Killed fourteen. Found diggings at dam, orchard, shed. Bastards get around."

"Sunset brings more?"

"Prob'ly not, the voice woulda said, but who knows what habits they pick up from the locals."

The tea was too hot and burnt his tongue. Just the way he liked it.

"Brian wants me to go look after people at the RSL. Reckons there's sixty sheltering there."

"Why? Are they hoping to provide a buffet? That place is all glass."

"Yep."

"But you'll help anyway."

"If time permits."

She nodded. Expected answer. "How much ammunition?"

"Magazines are full. Got six grenades. Here, you have this." He held out a Hummingbird with ten shots in it.

"Then what?"

"Bat. Or run."

"Not running."

"Perhaps you could use the fancy shelter I bought at great personal peril."

She gave him the stink-eye but it didn't work over her smile.

The night wasn't quiet. Nights aren't, they're full of insects and frogs and birds, all hiding, eating, mating and trying not to be eaten. Just on dusk, at some times of year the cicadas could be so loud you had to shout over them. Life went on. Fire and flood, nothing made this lot shut up. Not to be outdone, a dog barked in the distance.

> _Motion sensor. North tree line._

The rifle came up and his visor activated. Thermal overlay showed small shapes with a low heat signature.

"Threes. Six of them."

> _Probing defenses. Testing response time._

"Autumn, do I need to save ammunition?"

> _I can resupply you on the move if you earn more points. Right now you're basically looting my storage._

"Then I'd better make them count."

Three shots, three down. Pack scattered. Regrouped at tree line. Watching.

"They're learning."

> _Told you. Not smart—efficient. Pattern recognition without consciousness._

"What stops them?"

> _Death. Or nothing nearby worth eating. They'll strip biomass till ecosystem collapses, then move._

"Aren't you just a ray of sunshine."

> _I do my best._

It was full dark now, and the moon wasn't up yet. So far from urban filth, the Milky Way fairly blazed, the Southern Cross clear and obvious. Shapes moved in peripheral vision, there then gone. Eyes soon adjusted to the starlit land, seeing patterns, some real, some just healthy paranoia.

Inside her shelter Trixie tested equipment. He replied with his little UHF handset to her emergency radio call. She checked water filtration and air circulation and then checked it all again. Her way of maintaining control in a world gone mad. Or madder.

He found chainsaw marks on trees at the property line, but they weren't. There was a funny smell, too. Cut grass but not, different from their smell of death. A territory marker? Some sort of scent marker. Were they scent-based? He didn't know. Did they even notice the fences? Drawing a line in the dirt was such a human thing to do, a symbol saying: this far, no further.

More movement. Bigger. Four at the dam, drinking. Testing water? Searching biomass? He didn't know and didn't care enough to give it more thought, checking the safety was off instead.

Grenades from twenty metres. Two throws. The first fell short. The second overcompensated and also rolled, but that meant they were hit from both sides. Shrapnel fell like rain across the dam, ripples spreading. When vision cleared, nothing moved.

> _Style points: zero. Effectiveness: acceptable._

"I'm not performing."

> _Everything's performance. You're just bad at it._

"You're bad at shutting up."

> _Pffft, you'd be bored without me._

"Doubt it."

> _Liar._

She played a fragment of the Halo theme, not the whole riff but half a dozen unmistakeable notes, and he couldn't suppress the smile that played over his face.

> _I do love a man in armour. I'm not entirely sure about bright orange chaps._

Back at the caravan site, Trix emerged from the shelter. "Explosions."

"Fours at dam. Gone now."

"Gone means dead or gone means left?"

"Dead."

"Good." Pause. "Janna's place. Check it."

His stomach dropped. "Why?"

"Haven't seen her. Radio's dead. She's alone up there."

Janna. She was younger, just forty-four, a weird mix of tough and soppy. Lived upslope in the plant nursery that was her livelihood and was the birthplace of half the valley gardens.

"Right. Stay here. Shelter if—"

"I know."

There was a ute up the track, headlights cutting comforting cones through the dark. Janna's place lit up, her generator running. That was good. Lights meant life, probably.

Pulling in, he called out. No answer, and the door was open. Inside, furniture was flung about. There was broken glass and blood spatter on a wall. Not much. Some.

In the kitchen was more blood, a trail leading to the back door.

> _Chief. You don't want—_

"I know."

The nursery behind had raised beds and shade cloth, fenced with weldmesh panels, irrigation overhead. Sections were torn apart. Earth churned, plants shredded in patches. But not everywhere. Some beds untouched.

Blood trail led to machinery shed. Door forced open, hanging crooked. Inside: overturned potting benches, soil scattered. More blood on concrete floor. But no body. No bones. Nothing definitive.

> _She might have made it to the bush. Or they dragged her off._

"Her van isn't here."

> _Thermal scan shows nothing in a hundred-metre radius. Want me to—_

"No. Can't spare the time. If she's alive, she'll turn up."

He stood a long moment. Janna showed him native propagation. Shared cuttings. Made him tea with too much sugar. Called him "young man" despite the grey in his beard.

> _Chief. We should go._

"Yeah."

Back he drove. Trix looked at his face.

"Janna?"

"Not there. Blood trail, damage. No body."

"Could she—"

"Maybe. Generator's still running. Door was open. If she escaped..." He didn't finish.

"You'll check again?"

"At first light."

She nodded. Moment of silence between them. Valley getting smaller. Everyone knew everyone. Maybe Janna made it. Maybe not.

> _Sixty-two people at the RSL. Status unknown on seven valley residents._

"Don't."

> _You need to know who's left._

"Later."

> _Now. While you're functional. Planning requires data._

Maybe right. Maybe wrong. Either way: the count continued. Janna on the unknown list. More would follow. Simple mathematics.

"What's next priority?"

> _Your orchard. They'll hit that hard if they haven't already. Then the dam for water. Then systematic consumption of every living thing in this valley._

"Orchard then."

Trix grabbed his arm. "You're exhausted and bleeding. You're running on fumes."

"So?"

"So rest. Twenty minutes. Food. Water. Medical check. Then orchard."

"Don't have twenty—"

"Make time or collapse. Which helps more?"

Glared. She glared back. Standoff. She won — she always did.

Inside caravan: bread, jam, tea. Ate without tasting. Drank without noticing temperature. Fuel. Nothing more.

Trix changed leg dressing. Soaked through. Cleaned again. Fresh wrap. Tighter.

"It's not closing."

"It will."

"Needs stitches."

"Later."

"You'll bleed out."

"Later."

Another glare-off. Another loss.

> _I could cauterize it._

"No."

> _Small medical drone. Localized heat treatment. Seal the wound._

"I said no."

> _Infection risks—_

"Autumn. No."

> _You're impossible._

"You're not the first to notice."

Trix handed him water. "Drink."

He drank and handed it back.

"More."

He did.

"Sleep."

"Can't."

"Twenty minutes."

"They'll—"

"Motion sensors. Autumn wakes you. Twenty minutes or I lock you in shelter."

"You wouldn't."

She would. Saw it in her face.

"Fine. Twenty minutes."

He flaked out on the caravan bed and fell through darkness like a stone down a well. A moment later he woke to Autumn screaming out of the caravan speaker.

> _CHIEF! ORCHARD! NOW!_

Stumbled out. How long? Watch said thirty minutes. Trix shrugged apologetically.

Rifle, grenades. The ute started first try. Headlights speared the darkness toward the orchard.

Shapes everywhere. Not Threes or Fours. Bigger, cow-sized with six legs. Armored carapace, according to Autumn. Systematically stripping fruit trees. The entire orchard was under siege.

> _Sixes. Tanky bastards. Soft spots: joints, underbelly. Armor deflects most small arms._

"Grenades?"

> _Work. But you've got four left._

"Then make them count."

He parked the ute, headlights illuminating carnage. The first grenade sailed into a cluster of three Sixes feeding together. It was a ridiculous, tinny throw and the explosion flipped one, shredding two others. Joints were exposed on the survivor and he put rounds into the gaps with gratifying results.

The second grenade caught a pair near apple trees. Apples were Trix's favorites. Both were caught in blast. He grinned ferally.

Two grenades left. Dozen Sixes remaining.

> _Conserve your rounds. Go for joints. Aim small, miss small._

Sniper work then. He found a position behind the shed, a good stable shooting platform. Methodical shots targeted joint, joint, underbelly, joint. Every shot counted.

But finally they got wind of his position, or saw the muzzle flash. Big, fast and angry, they charged silently toward him. Right into the roll of another grenade. The grass slowed it but the slope compensated. It was complete bullshit but it worked. One grenade between them. Both down.

Last grenade. Eight Sixes left. Not enough.

> _Run._

"No."

> _Chief—_

"My trees. My land. No."

He channelled the A-team and switched to full auto. The magazine dumped into the nearest Six, joints, gaps, and soft spots. It died hard but it went down. He flung the empty magazine aside and slammed a fresh one in too hard, tried again with a seating click. 

They were converging now. Recognising the threat but not smart about it, like they relied on numbers. Numbers they didn't have, today.

Last magazine. Four left. Not enough ammunition. Not enough time.

> _You're in the black and you can afford a turret._

"Do it."

Air shimmered. Automatic turret appeared on shed roof. Another at orchard edge. Both opened up—precise, economical, devastating. Four Sixes down in seconds.

Silence after. Just fire crackling in one tree they'd damaged. Smell of cut grass and cordite. Breathing hard.

> _Eighty points. You're out of the hole._

"How many more waves?"

> _Until you kill them all or they kill you. That's the game, Chief._

Walked through orchard. Damage assessment. Fifteen trees destroyed—roots exposed, bark stripped, branches broken. Thirty damaged but salvageable. Twenty untouched.

Could work with that. Prune damaged sections. Protect remainder. Adapt.

Trix appeared at orchard edge, Hummingbird ready. "Done?"

"For now."

She surveyed damage. "Five years growing those trees. They were going to start fruiting."

"Thirty left."

"Fifteen dead."

"They aren't dead, they have adult root systems. They'll be back up in a year. Could be a lot worse."

"Could be better."

"Usually is."

Moment of silence between them. Respect for lost work. Then: "What now?"

"Space girl, what magic have you got for tired old men?"

> _Old? Would you like a lolly, little boy? Five points, and not really good for you. Also quite addictive, so if you're still alive tomorrow I'm going to ruin your day with a purgative._

"Right now we're going to get inside your hidey-hole and I'm going to sleep. When the sun's up I suppose I'll have to assess the whole valley. See who's left. Help where possible."

"And after?"

"Keep killing them till they stop coming. Or we're dead. It's not complicated."

"No. Simple but not easy."

"Never is."

They walked back to the caravan together, the sky lightening east, purple to grey. The avian changing of the guard, a different song to announce the new day. Kookaburras first, laughing at the absurdity. Everything dying, birds still laughing. Australia in miniature.

> _Valley census: forty confirmed alive. Fifteen dead or missing. Seven unknown. Sixty-two yesterday._

"Don't."

> _You need to know._

"Later."

> _Now. While you're numb. Easier to process._

He shrugged and her litany went on. Janna made sixteen. More would follow. It was simple and brutal: time and exposure, everyone dies eventually. But that was no change, and he found an odd comfort in the thought.

At the caravan, tea again. Trix's solution to everything. Hot tea, bit of sugar. Sip and survive.

"We can't go on like this."

He looked at her till she went on.

"We need more people. You called it something..."

"Defense in depth."

"That."

"So?"

"God, you're impossible to talk to."

He slept and dreamt of Janna's nursery burning. Amber eyes watched through the flames, watching and waiting for him to act. Loyalty without judgement, beyond death.

Woke to Trix shaking shoulder. "Helicopter."

Outside. Rotors loud, low and slow, a civilian bird, yellow and white. Media markings. It flew the length of the valley bellowing something from speakers on the skids.

> _Government announcement. Evacuation order. All citizens directed to relocation centers._

"They can fuck off."

> _Legally—_

"I said they can fuck off."

> _Just checking your position._

Helicopter made three passes and took off again. Gone.

> _The relocation order is apparently legally binding. Although I don't think they realise this place has a Vanguard in residence._

"Still don't care."

Trix emerged from shelter. "Staying?"

"Staying."

"Thought so." She had packs ready. Supplies. Ammunition. Water. Methodical preparation while he slept. "Others will stay too. Oleksiy for sure."

"Dozen maybe. Enough for coordination. Not enough for proper defense."

"Then we get clever."

"Define clever."

"Traps. Choke points. Overlapping fields of fire. Make them pay for every meter."

"Scorched earth."

"If necessary."

She nodded. It was him all over. The confidence of the bloody-minded. "Let's get started."

Sun clearing ridge. Valley lit gold. Morning birds in full chorus. Smoke still rising from Janna's place. New day. Same war.

> _Autumn's voice almost gentle. Chief? For what it's worth — you're doing well._

"Don't need reassurance."

> _I know. You're getting it anyway. Free of charge._

"Nothing's free."

> _This is. You're a sort of investment. I believe in you._

"Touching."

> _I contain multitudes._

"You contain bullshit."

> _Hunh. Takes one to know one._

He checked the rifle and counted the grenades. Chainsaw. Armor. All present. All functional. Everything needed to make something bleed.

"Trix. How're you?"

"Alive. Scared. Stubborn. You?"

"Same. Let's stay that way."

"Deal."

Shook on it. Proper handshake, firm and brief. Partners in survival. Married twenty years but this felt like new vows. Simpler ones. Stay alive. Watch each other's backs. Don't die stupid.

> _Valley network establishing. Others checking in. Oleksiy's got helicopter. Maria's organizing medical. Lulu's dad has ammunition stores. Building something here, Chief._

"What're we building?"

> _Whatever survives. Now move. Dawn's when they feed heaviest._

Ute started. Trix in passenger seat, Hummingbird ready. Rifle between knees. Grenades in pockets. Chainsaw in tray. Everything needed.

Drove toward dawn. Toward whatever came next. Simple plan: kill everything trying to kill them. Keep killing till nothing left to kill or nothing left to fight with.

Not complicated. Not easy. 

But doable. Maybe. If he was lucky and smart and stubborn enough.

Kookaburras laughed in the trees. Mad birds laughing at a mad, mad world. He laughed too. Why not? 

Trix looked at him. "You right?"

"Probably not. Let's go anyway."

"That's the spirit."

> _For the record? I like both of you. Try not to die._

He spat.

> _Good enough._

Valley ahead. Forest around. Aliens somewhere in between. Kill or be killed. Old as dirt. Probably older. They drove on.

The squealing hit first. A sow, maybe four hundred kilos, crashing through the scrub with five of the aliens in panicked flight ahead of her. One clutched a dead piglet.

Up the nearest bloodwood like he was sixteen again. Sows don't climb, but they do hold grudges, and this one was ready to murder everything in a hundred-metre radius. Trixie was in another tree, higher than him. She'd been smart enough to run a different way, make sure at least one of them wasn't pursued.

The sow stopped below, looking for something to kill. The aliens kept running. Smart choice. After a while she left. They waited a while before climbing down.

"How many points was that?"

> _Seven. Congratulations, you're no longer broke._

"What about a recon drone? If I'm hunting blind—"

> _Sixty points. Keep killing._

They worked through the property systematically, Autumn marking locations as he cleared them. The pattern was obvious: they went for anything lush, anything cultivated. Native bush they mostly ignored—the eucalypts and wattles were too toxic, too low in nutrients. Good. That meant the forest itself might survive even if the Antithesis won.

Small comfort.

> _You're at forty-three points. We should check on your other neighbors._

"Oleksiy's closest. He's—"

> _Armed, capable, and has a bunker mentality. The other direction._

"Janna." The nursery. Twenty thousand plants in shadecloth houses, irrigation on a timer, her whole livelihood in one spot. "Right."

It took thirty minutes to reach her driveway, mostly due to a detour around a gully full of something he didn't recognize and didn't want to meet yet. When he crested the rise, the silence was total.

The shadecloth was gone. Not torn down—gone. Eaten, presumably. The star pickets stood naked, wire traces on the ground. Not a single plant remained. Her cabin was timber-framed, struc pine because it's cheap. They'd eaten the frame. The roof had collapsed into the space where walls used to be, fibro sheets cracked and twisted, gutters bent like aluminum foil.

He stopped walking.

"Autumn."

> _I know._

The irrigation tanks were twenty thousand litres each, corrugated steel, up on ten-metre stands. Vines trailed from the access hatches. Not lantana—these were grey-green, wrong texture, moving slightly in still air.

"Is she...?"

> _I can't tell from here. Do you want me to—_

"No." Walking again. "Grenades?"

> _Standard fragmentation, three points each._

"Give me three."

They appeared in his hands one at a time, simple spheres with pins. The first pin came free, lobbed underhand toward the nearest tank. The spoon flew free with a bright spang and he was already moving back—

WHAM.

The tank ruptured, water and shredded vine spraying out. Things boiled out of the split seam, small and fast, heading straight for him. Out came the second pin, two, three, he threw it into the mass.

WHAM.

The third went into the far tank while they were still reforming. That one actually tumbled into the hatch, and when it went off the entire tank bulged, seams splitting, water pouring out in sheets.

Nothing else moved.

Wait. Wait. Still nothing.

"I need something for cleanup. Something that'll—"

> _Burn it?_

"Burn it."

> _Incendiary grenade, five points._

"One for now."

He walked to where the cabin used to be, close enough to see inside the wreckage. The bed frame was steel, still intact. Everything else was gone. No body. Maybe she'd gotten out, gone to neighbors, wasn't home when—

Something white in the wreckage. Bone. Femur, by the size.

"Autumn."

> _I see it._

"Incendiary."

> _Are you—_

"She'd want a proper fire. Better than rotting in the wreckage."

The grenade appeared. He pulled the pin, set it carefully in the center of the collapse, and walked away. Behind him, the whump of ignition, then the crackle of fire finding fibro and dried timber and beginning to properly burn.

By the time he reached the driveway, smoke rose black and thick. Old hardwood would burn for hours, hot enough to reduce anything organic to ash. No gravestone, no words. Just smoke rising into the empty sky.

> _I'm sorry._

"Yeah."

They walked back toward home in silence. After a while, Autumn spoke again.

> _You're at thirty-two points. You earned more clearing her property._

"Doesn't feel like it."

> _It never does. But you gave her a clean end. That's not nothing._

No answer, nothing to say. He'd killed some aliens, burned a body, and walked away. Hurrah for the Brave New World.

> _We should talk about defensive strategy._

"Later. I want to know whether Trixie's alright."

> _She is. The shelter monitors show her inside, vital signs normal. She's reading._

"Reading what?"

> _The emergency manual I included. She's taking notes._

That sounded like Trixie. End of the world, alien invasion, hiding in a bunker—might as well study. Something unclenched in his chest.

"What's our point total?"

> _Thirty-two. Enough for basic defensive equipment, not enough for proper infrastructure._

"What do I need?"

> _To keep killing things until you can afford sensors, automated defense, and proper fortifications. But you already knew that._

"Yeah."

The walk back stretched longer than he remembered. His leg was throbbing again, Brian's field dressing soaked through. The armor jacket from Autumn's "personal collection" was keeping him upright, some kind of medical monitoring built in, but there were limits to what gear could fix.

The caravan clearing appeared through the trees. Trixie was outside the shelter, Hummingbird in hand, watching his approach with the kind of focus that said she'd been waiting and worrying.

"You're late."

"Had to make a stop."

"You're bleeding."

"Brian patched it. It's fine."

"It's not fine. Get inside." She pointed at the shelter. "There's a proper medical kit in there and I've read the manual. Sit down and let me fix what you've broken."

She worked efficiently, cutting away the old bandage, cleaning the wound again, applying something that stung like hell but probably prevented infection. New bandage, properly wrapped, tighter than Brian's.

"There. Now you'll live long enough to do something else stupid."

"That's the plan."

She looked at him, really looked, and her expression softened slightly. "You went to town. Got the chainsaw. Came back past Janna's."

"How did you—"

"You've got ash on your jacket. And that look you get when things are worse than you want to admit." She sat beside him on the shelter's step. "She didn't make it, did she?"

"No."

"Anyone else?"

"Brian's alright. Sixty people sheltering at the RSL. Haven't checked the others yet."

"Then that's what we do next. We check on everyone, we help who we can, and we don't quit until either the aliens are dead or we are."

He stared at his wife of twenty-five years, who'd managed his money and his memory and his tendency to acquire chainsaws, who'd turned cramped caravans into homes and refused to shoot wallabies even when they ate her garden. She was holding a Hummingbird like she'd been born to it, jaw set in that expression that meant she'd made a decision and arguing was pointless.

"When did you get so bloodthirsty?"

"When they ate my herbs. Nobody rips up my garden and lives."

> _I like her._

"Me too." He didn't mention wallabies.

They sat for a moment, watching the valley. The smoke from Janna's pyre had dissipated. The kookaburras were still silent. But the sun was setting, and they were alive, and that was enough for now.

Tomorrow they'd fight again. Tonight they'd rest.

Behind them, the shelter hummed quietly, keeping its small piece of safety intact while the world burned.

# Getting Started

"What sort of help can you actually give me?"

> _That depends entirely on your point balance and token allocation. Did you want the technical breakdown?_

"Eventually. For now assume my short-term memory is rubbish and I'll need constant reminding, which will annoy me. What I want is tactical analysis. I'll propose strategies, you critique their effectiveness and dependencies, we work out a practical approach with contingencies."

> _That's not how most Vanguards operate._

"Most plans last about thirty seconds once contact is made. But between engagements you need a framework, not random thrashing about hoping something works."

> _Spoken like someone who's actually been shot at. You know what? I'm going to enjoy working with you. Now, about your public identity—_

"No."

> _I haven't even—_

"Whatever you're about to suggest: no. I don't need a brand, I need to keep my forest from being eaten and my neighbors alive if possible."

> _Your neighbors are scattered across forty square kilometres of valley and you have sixty-nine points remaining. We should discuss priorities._

The suspension creaked as the ute lurched down the last section of driveway toward the creek track. He'd lived out here long enough that the sound of the forest had become background, but now the silence pressed against his ears. No kookaburras. No whipbirds. Just the diesel and the creak of springs.

"First priority is Trix and the property. Then we see who else needs help."

> _Practical. I'll prepare a tactical overlay._

He pulled up at the caravan. Trix wasn't inside. His stomach dropped before he heard the crack of wood on something that squealed. She was down by the garden, his old cricket bat in both hands, facing down three dog-sized things that were methodically eating her herb garden.

"Autumn, another Hummingbird."

The pistol appeared in his hand. Two shots, two down. The third spun toward him and he put one through the centre mass. Trix was breathing hard, bat still raised.

"Here." He held out the pistol. "Tap the side for the laser dot. It's disposable, so when it's empty just drop it."

She took it, hands steadier than he expected. "How many more are there?"

"Lots. Your citrus trees by the high creek—they'll go for those next. Anything fruiting or flowering draws them like flies."

"Then go." She pointed the Hummingbird at the ground, finger off the trigger. Good habits die hard. "I'll defend here."

"You'll run out of ammunition."

"Then I'll use the bat."

> _She's either very brave or very stubborn._

"Both," he muttered. Louder: "Autumn, can we secure a hardened shelter? Something that'll keep her safe if things get serious. Food, water, air filtration, the works."

> _A proper refuge with independent power, supplies, and emergency exit capability runs 120 points. You have sixty-nine._

"Then give me what sixty-nine points gets."

> _That's everything you have. You'll be—_

"Broke. Yes. Do it. Put it down the slope from the caravan, somewhere with good drainage."

The air shimmered and something appeared below the house. Not the elaborate bunker he'd imagined—more of a reinforced shipping container, but the door looked solid and there were proper ventilation fixtures on top.

> _Scaled for available budget. Food, water, air filtration, independent power. Five days of supplies for one person. You're at zero points._

"When things get hairy, get inside that. It locks from inside, you can open it again after, and there's supplies for a week."

Trixie stared at it. "That's not— How did—"

"Space magic. I'll explain later." He counted the rounds left in the Hummingbird. "Autumn, give her two more of these. Show her how to check remaining shots."

> _I can't._

"What?"

> _You're at zero points. No credit, Chief. That's the rule._

Cold settled in his stomach. He'd bought Trix's safety and left himself with nothing. Stupid. Short-sighted. Exactly the kind of thing she'd been managing his finances to prevent for twenty years.

"Right. Fine." He looked at Trixie. "You've got one Hummingbird and the bat. Make every shot count. I'll be back."

"Where are you going?"

"To get proper equipment."

He drove the ute too fast down the valley track, suspension protesting. The servo in town had closed three hours ago when the incursions started, but the hardware store—Brian ran that, and Brian lived above it. If he was lucky, the old bastard would still be alive.

The town was deserted. Not evacuated—just empty, like everyone had stepped inside at once. No bodies. No obvious damage. Just silence and a kind of tension in the air that made his skin crawl.

Brian's hardware store door was locked but the lights were on. He banged on the glass.

"Brian! It's me!"

A face appeared at the window—older than the universe, suspicious as hell. The door cracked open.

"You armed?"

"Yes. Low on ammo. You?"

"Rifle. What do you need?"

"Chainsaw. Chaps. Fuel. Two-stroke oil." He counted out cash from his wallet—always carried cash, even though Trixie managed the accounts. Old habit. "I'll pay double."

"Keep your money. We're past that." Brian disappeared into the back, returned with a Stihl MS661—professional grade, near-new. Chaps followed, bright orange, properly certified. A jerry can of fuel-oil mix. "You know how to sharpen chain?"

"I've felled a hundred trees."

"Then take this too." A sharpening kit. "And this." A first aid kit, the serious kind with tourniquets and pressure bandages. "You're bleeding."

Looking down, he found his jeans were soaked on one thigh, dark and wet. "Spike got me earlier. Hadn't noticed."

"You're going into shock." Brian grabbed his arm, surprisingly strong for seventy-plus. "Sit. Now."

"I don't have time—"

"You don't have time to bleed out either. Sit."

He sat. Brian cut the jeans away, exposed the puncture. Not deep, but messy. He cleaned it, packed it, wrapped it tight. Professional work—marine medic in Vietnam. One of those stories Brian only told when very drunk.

"You'll do," Brian said. "But you're an idiot. Whatever you're planning, don't do it alone."

"I'm not alone."

"The woman?"

"Trixie. My wife."

"Bring her here. Safer in town."

"She won't leave."

Brian grunted—the sound of someone who'd met that particular kind of stubborn before. "Then keep your head down and shoot straight."

Gear went into the ute. The chainsaw was heavier than he remembered, or maybe he was just tired. The leg was starting to throb now that Brian had made him notice it.

"Brian. Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Just survive." He paused at the door. "And if you see any of those things in town—don't let them get to the shops. We've got sixty people sheltering in the RSL. They'll come for the food."

"I'll spread the word."

"Do that."

The drive back took longer. Vision fuzzed at the edges, and he had to force himself to focus on the road. Blood loss, probably. Or shock. Or just the accumulated stress of the last few hours catching up.

When he pulled into the caravan's clearing, Trixie was standing guard with the Hummingbird, eyes tracking the tree line. She ran to the ute when she saw it was him.

"You're hurt."

"Brian patched me up. How many more?"

"Three. Small ones. The shelter door works—I tested it." She looked at the chainsaw in the ute's tray. "That's not alien technology."

"No."

"You spent all your points on me."

"Yes."

She was quiet for a moment. Then: "You're an idiot."

"Been told that today already."

> _Autumn's voice crackled through the ute's stereo—Chief, check the tray. Behind the chainsaw._

He looked. There were boxes there—proper Protectorate shipping, the kind that just appeared out of nowhere. An armor jacket, reinforced but flexible. A tactical visor. A rifle with self-contained magazines. Grenades. A full combat loadout.

"What the hell?"

> _I make equipment for my own use. Sometimes I leave it lying around. Not my fault if people find it._

"Autumn—"

> _No credit, remember? I didn't give you anything. I just happen to store my personal effects in your vehicle. What you do with them is your business._

He stared at the equipment. "This is—"

> _Rule lawyering at its finest? Yes. Technically I'm just careless about where I leave my things. Technically you're not purchasing anything. Technically this is me being forgetful about inventory management._

Trixie was looking at the boxes, then at him. "Your alien friend is a bureaucratic ninja."

> _Fun and smart I'm not sure you deserve either of us._

"Can you do this? Without getting in trouble?"

> _Chief, the rules say no credit. They don't say I can't have personal possessions. They don't say where I have to store them. And they definitely don't say what you can do with equipment you find lying around. If someone wants to argue about it, they're welcome to try. But I'd like to see them prove I deliberately placed these items for your use rather than just being negligent about storage protocols._

He pulled the armor jacket out, examined it. Perfect fit. "You measured me."

> _I measure everything. It's handy when the dick measuring starts. Now suit up before something eats you. We have a valley to defend and I'd rather not train a new Vanguard from scratch. Good candidates are hard to find. Not all of you survive the wafer implant, and most of you get eaten in the first ten minutes._

The citrus trees were four hundred metres upslope, chickenwire cages around star pickets keeping wallabies out. The wire was intact but something was working at the bases of the trees, roots exposed, bark stripped. Five of them, same dog-sized species, too focused on feeding to notice until he was twenty metres away.

The Hummingbird made satisfying little phut sounds. Five shots, five down. Almost disappointingly easy.

> _Don't get cocky. You've killed the stupid ones._

Movement in the understory. He froze, trying to identify—

The squealing hit first. A sow, maybe four hundred kilos, crashing through the lantana with five of the aliens in panicked flight ahead of her. One clutched a dead piglet.

Up the nearest bloodwood like he was sixteen again. Sows don't climb, but they do hold grudges, and this one was ready to murder everything in a hundred-metre radius.

She stopped below, looking for something to kill. The aliens kept running. Smart choice.

"How many points was that?"

> _Seven. Congratulations, you're no longer broke._

"What about a recon drone? If I'm hunting blind—"

> _Sixty points. Keep killing._

They worked through the property systematically, Autumn marking locations as he cleared them. The pattern was obvious: they went for anything lush, anything cultivated. Native bush they mostly ignored—the eucalypts and wattles were too toxic, too low in nutrients. Good. That meant the forest itself might survive even if the Antithesis won.

Small comfort.

> _You're at forty-three points. We should check on your other neighbors._

"Oleksiy's closest. He's—"

> _Armed, capable, and has functional bunker mentality. The other direction._

"Janna." The nursery. Twenty thousand plants in shadecloth houses, irrigation on a timer, her whole livelihood in one spot. "Right."

It took thirty minutes to reach her driveway, mostly due to a detour around a gully full of something he didn't recognize and didn't want to meet yet. When he crested the rise, the silence was total.

The shadecloth was gone. Not torn down—gone. Eaten, presumably. The star pickets stood naked, wire traces on the ground, and not a single plant remained. Her cabin was timber-framed, struc pine because it's cheap. They'd eaten the frame. The roof had collapsed into the space where walls used to be, fibro sheets cracked and twisted, gutters bent like aluminum foil.

He stopped walking.

"Autumn."

> _I know._

The irrigation tanks were twenty thousand litres each, corrugated steel, up on ten-metre stands. Vines trailed from the access hatches. Not lantana—these were grey-green, wrong texture, moving slightly in still air.

"Is she...?"

> _I can't tell from here. Do you want me to—_

"No." Walking again. "Grenades?"

> _Standard fragmentation, three points each._

"Give me three."

They appeared in his hands one at a time, simple spheres with pins. The first pin came free, lobbed underhand toward the nearest tank. The spoon flew free with a bright spang and he was already moving back—

WHAM.

The tank ruptured, water and shredded vine spraying out. Things boiled out of the split seam, small and fast, heading straight for him. Out came the second pin, two, three, he threw it into the mass.

WHAM.

The third went into the far tank while they were still reforming. That one actually tumbled into the hatch, and when it went off the entire tank bulged, seams splitting, water pouring out in sheets.

Nothing else moved.

Wait. Wait. Still nothing.

"I need something for cleanup. Something that'll—"

> _Burn it?_

"Burn it."

> _Incendiary grenade, five points._

"One for now."

He walked to where the cabin used to be, close enough to see inside the wreckage. The bed frame was steel, still intact. Everything else was gone. No body. Maybe she'd gotten out, gone to neighbors, wasn't home when—

Something white in the wreckage. Bone. Femur, by the size.

"Autumn."

> _I see it._

"Incendiary."

> _Are you—_

"She'd want a proper fire. Better than rotting in the wreckage."

The grenade appeared. He pulled the pin, set it carefully in the center of the collapse, and walked away. Behind him, the whump of ignition, then the crackle of fire finding fibro and dried timber and beginning to properly burn.

By the time he reached the driveway, smoke rose black and thick. Old hardwood would burn for hours, hot enough to reduce anything organic to ash. No gravestone, no words. Just smoke rising into the empty sky.

> _I'm sorry._

"Yeah."

They walked back toward home in silence. After a while, Autumn spoke again.

> _You're at thirty-two points. You earned more clearing her property._

"Doesn't feel like it."

> _It never does. But you gave her a clean end. That's not nothing._

No answer, nothing to say. He'd killed some aliens, burned a body, and walked away. Hurrah for the Brave New World.

> _We should talk about defensive strategy._

"Later. I want to know whether Trixie's alright."

> _She is. The shelter monitors show her inside, vital signs normal. She's reading._

"Reading what?"

> _The emergency manual I included. She's taking notes._

That sounded like Trixie. End of the world, alien invasion, hiding in a bunker—might as well study. Something unclenched in his chest.

"What's our point total?"

> _Thirty-two. Enough for basic defensive equipment, not enough for proper infrastructure._

"What do I need?"

> _To keep killing things until you can afford sensors, automated defense, and proper fortifications. But you already knew that._

"Yeah."

The walk back stretched longer than he remembered. His leg was throbbing again, Brian's field dressing soaked through. The armor jacket from Autumn's "personal collection" was keeping him upright, some kind of medical monitoring built in, but there were limits to what gear could fix.

The caravan clearing appeared through the trees. Trixie was outside the shelter, Hummingbird in hand, watching his approach with the kind of focus that said she'd been waiting and worrying.

"You're late."

"Had to make a stop."

"You're bleeding."

"Brian patched it. It's fine."

"It's not fine. Get inside." She pointed at the shelter. "There's a proper medical kit in there and I've read the manual. Sit down and let me fix what you've broken."

She worked efficiently, cutting away the old bandage, cleaning the wound again, applying something that stung like hell but probably prevented infection. New bandage, properly wrapped, tighter than Brian's.

"There. Now you'll live long enough to do something else stupid."

"That's the plan."

She looked at him, really looked, and her expression softened slightly. "You went to town. Got the chainsaw. Came back past Janna's."

"How did you—"

"You've got ash on your jacket. And that look you get when things are worse than you want to admit." She sat beside him on the shelter's step. "She didn't make it, did she?"

"No."

"Anyone else?"

"Brian's alive. Sixty people sheltering at the RSL. Haven't checked the others yet."

"Then that's what we do next. We check on everyone, we help who we can, and we don't quit until either the aliens are dead or we are."

He stared at his wife of twenty-five years, who'd managed his money and his memory and his tendency to acquire chainsaws, who'd turned cramped caravans into homes and refused to shoot wallabies even when they ate her garden. She was holding a Hummingbird like she'd been born to it, jaw set in that expression that meant she'd made a decision and arguing was pointless.

"When did you get so bloodthirsty?"

"When they ate my herbs. Nobody rips up my garden and lives."

> _I like her._

"Me too." He didn't mention wallabies.

They sat for a moment, watching the valley. The smoke from Janna's pyre had dissipated. The kookaburras were still silent. But the sun was setting, and they were alive, and that was enough for now.

Tomorrow they'd fight again. Tonight they'd rest.

Behind them, the shelter hummed quietly, keeping its small piece of safety intact while the world burned.

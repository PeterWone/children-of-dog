# Getting Started

> "Plans are worthless, but planning is everything."  
> &mdash; Dwight D. Eisenhower

---

"What can you actually give me?"

> _Depends on points and tokens. Want the breakdown?_

"Later. Assume my memory's shit and constant reminding pisses me off. I want tactical analysis. I propose, you critique, we work out something practical."

> _Not how most Vanguards operate._

"Most plans last thirty seconds. Still need a framework between fights."

> _Spoken like someone who's been shot at. I'm going to enjoy this. Now, about your public identity—_

"No."

> _I haven't—_

"Whatever you're suggesting: no. I need my forest alive and my neighbors breathing."

> _Neighbors scattered across forty kilometres. Sixty-nine points. Priorities._

The ute lurched down the drive. He'd lived here long enough that forest sound was background—but now silence pressed at his ears. No kookaburras. No whipbirds. Just diesel and creaking springs.

"Trix first. Property. Then who else needs help."

> _Practical. Preparing tactical overlay._

He pulled up at the caravan. Trix wasn't inside. Stomach dropped before he heard wood crack on something squealing. Garden. His cricket bat in her hands. Three dog-sized things methodically eating her herbs.

"Autumn. Hummingbird."

A pistol appeared. Two shots, two down. The third spun when he hit it center mass. Trix was breathing hard, bat raised.

"Here." He offered the pistol. "Laser's on the side. Disposable. Empty means drop it."

She took it. Steadier than expected. "How many more?"

"Lots. Citrus by the high creek—they'll hit that next. Anything fruiting."

"Then go." The Hummingbird was pointed down and her finger was off the trigger. Good habits. "I'll hold here."

"You'll run dry."

"I have this." She hefted the cricket bat.

> _Is she brave or stubborn?_

"Both." Then louder: "Autumn. I want a hardened shelter to keep her safe when it gets serious. Food, water, air, everything."

> _Aproper refuge with independent power and an emergency exit is 120 points. You have sixty-nine._

"Give me what sixty-nine gets."

> _That's everything. You'll be—_

"Broke. Do it. Below the caravan, good drainage."

Air shimmered and a reinforced container appeared. It had a solid door and ventilation on top.

> _Scaled for budget. Food, water, air, power. Five days, one person. You have no points._

He ignored Autumn's admonishment, looking at Trixie. "When things get hairy, get inside and lock yourself in. You have supplies for a Week."

Trixie stared. "How—"

"Space magic. Later." He checked the Hummingbird's rounds. "Autumn, give her two more Hummingbirds. Can you show her the counter?"

> _Can't._

"What?"

> _Zero points. No credit. I did warn you._

Cold in his stomach. He'd bought Trix's safety but left himself nothing to work with. Short-sighted. Exactly what she managed his finances to prevent.

"Right." He looked at Trixie. "One pistol and the bat. Every shot counts. Back soon."

"Where are you going?"

"Into town to get some gear."

The ute didn't like the speed he went down the valley track, suspension protesting and the vehicle lurching and bouncing. The servo would have closed three hours ago when incursions started, but Brian lived above his hardware store. If he was lucky, the old bastard was still alive.

Town was deserted. Not evacuated, the streets were empty, like everyone stepped inside at once. No bodies, no damage. Just silence and tension crawling his skin.

Brian's hardware was locked but the shop lights were all on. He banged on the glass.

"Brian! You there?"

A familiar face appeared at the window, old as stars, and suspicious. The door cracked and suspicion was replaced by recognition and concern.

"You armed?"

"Yeah. Low ammo. You?"

"Rifle. What do you need?"

"Chainsaw. Chaps. Fuel. Two-stroke oil and a mixer." He pulled cash from his wallet. They didn't do EFTPOS. What he did with his money was none of the government's business. "Double."

"Keep it. We're past that." Brian vanished into the depths of his shop, returning with a Stihl MS661. Professional, near-new. He also brought orange chaps, certified, and a Jerry can. "I imagine you know how to sharpen a chain?"

"Felled hundreds of trees. I use a bench-mounted sharpener."

"Here, not as good but portable." It was a sharpening kit. "And these." First aid—tourniquets, pressure bandages. "You're bleeding."

He looked down to discover hes jeans soaked dark on one thigh. "Spike earlier. Didn't notice."

"Shock." Brian grabbed his arm. Strong for seventy-plus. "Sit. Now."

"No time—"

"No time to bleed out either. Sit."

He sat. Brian cut the fabric away, exposing a puncture wound. It wasn't deep but it was messy. The old man cleaned and packed it, wrapping it tight. He'd been a medic in Vietnam. It wasn't something he talked about.

"You'll get there. Try to be less of a twit, this time: don't do it alone."

"Not alone."

"Missus?"

"In a shelter."

"Bring her to town. Safer here."

"She won't leave."

Brian grunted. He knew that kind of stubborn. "Keep your head down and shoot straight."

They heaved the gear into the ute. This chainsaw was heavier than his cheap chinese unit. Or he was tired. His leg throbbed now Brian had made him notice.

"Brian. Thanks."

"Thank me by surviving." A pause. "Those things are in town. Don't let them reach the shops. There's sixty people in the RSL. They'll come for food."

"Spread the word."

"Righto."

The drive back took much longer. Vision fuzzed about the edges. He focussed on road. Blood loss was making him light-headed. Shock. Stress.

He rolled up to the caravan in its clearing. Trixie stood guard, Hummingbird ready, watching the tree line. She stopped doing that and ran up when she saw him.

"You're hurt." She said it like an accusation.

"Brian patched me up. How many?"

"Three. Small. The shelter works, I tried it out." She glared at the chainsaw. "That's not alien."

"No."

"You spent everything on me."

"Yep."

Quiet moment. "Idiot."

"Heard that already."

> _Chief. Check the tray. Behind the chainsaw._

He looked. There were boxes. Very different, very familiar. He popped one open. A lumber jacket, armoured and flexible. A tactical visor. A very mundane yet well made rifle, with weird disposable-looking magazines. _Grenades._ Full combat loadout.

"What the hell?"

> _I make things. Sometimes I leave them lying around. It's not my fault if someone finds them useful._

"Autumn—"

> _No credit, remember? I hope you don't mind if I keep my stuff in your vehicle._

He stared. "This is—"

> _A technicality. Lodge a complaint._

Trixie looked between boxes and him. "Your alien's a bureaucratic ninja."

> _She's fun and smart. I'm not sure you deserve either of us._

"Can you do this? Without trouble?"

> _Do what? I don't mind you borrowing my stuff but if you break it there will be words._

Pulled armor out. Perfect fit. "Measured me."

> _Measure everything. Handy for dick measuring. Suit up before something eats you. Valley to defend, rather not train new Vanguard from scratch. Good candidates rare. Not all survive wafer implant. Most get eaten first ten minutes._

Citrus four hundred metres upslope. Chickenwire, star pickets, wallaby-proof. Wire intact. Something at tree bases. Roots exposed, bark stripped. Five dog-sized, focused feeding. Didn't spot them till twenty metres, scared the shit out of him.

The Hummingbird made satisfying phut sounds. Five shots, five down. Disappointingly easy.

> _Don't get cocky. You've killed the stupid ones._

Movement understory. Froze—wallaby-sized, hunched shapes eating exposed roots.

> _Fours. Pack hunters. Stop grinding points on the easy ones. Move._

"Protecting the trees."

> _Then use the grenades. Two Fours aren't—_

Squealing from below. Not wallaby. Pig-sized. More pig-shaped. Tusks flashing in failing light. Three of them, heading downhill.

> _Fives. Those are Fives. Chief, get clear._

He ran. Slipped on wet leaves, caught himself. Pig-things faster. Not running from him—running at the caravan.

At Trix.

Thirty metres between them and his wife. He wasn't going to make it.

Raised rifle. First shot center mass on the leader. Down. Second shot wing hit. Third stumbled. Missed.

Trix fired. Laser dot on pig-thing's head. Hummingbird crack. Down.

Third made it to clearing before he tagged it. Roll, squealing, bleeding. Trix approached, bat raised. Two-handed overhead like cricket boundary hit. Skull crunch.

She looked up at him. Breathing hard. Spattered. "How many more?"

"Lots."

"Need bigger bat."

> _I like her._

"She's alright, I suppose."

Walked circuitous back to citrus. Approach from downwind, quiet. Wallaby-sized pair still feeding. Grenades felt unfamiliar. Pull pin. Release spoon. Count. Throw.

One landed perfect—between them. Other went long. Flash-crack. One vaporized. Other shredded. Messy.

> _Effectiveness over aesthetics. Plus side: eighty points._

"From?"

> _Five Fives, twelve Threes, couple Fours. Good morning's work._

"Not morning."

> _Somewhere it is. Optimism, Chief._

Chainsaw time. Downed trees needed processing. Antithesis bodies—cut them up, scatter pieces. Rot faster. Feed soil. Same circle, different scale.

Fired saw. Sweet two-stroke roar. Cut into nearest Four. Resistance then give. Not wood. Meat consistency, plant smell. Cut grass. Odd.

> _Cellulose structure, not muscle. Efficient. Adaptive. Also explains why they eat biomass—building themselves from available materials._

"Smart."

> _Not remotely. Efficient. Different thing._

Sectioned bodies. Smaller pieces rotted faster. Kicked sections into bush. Something would eat them. Goannas maybe. Adapt or die—Australia's only rule.

Walked property edge. More signs. Diggings near dam. Tree damage by machinery shed. Root exposure at orchard border. Systematic. Testing defenses. Probing.

> _They're learning territory._

"So'm I."

Dusk settling purple. Temperature dropping. Not cold—never really cold. But noticeable. Trix had hurricane lamp lit at caravan. Yellow glow in gathering dark.

She'd dragged bodies into pile away from house. Practical. Made tea on camp stove. Two mugs.

"Situation?"

"Killed fourteen. Found diggings at dam, orchard, shed. They're scouting."

"Sunset brings more?"

"Likely. Nocturnal feeders in the model organisms. Antithesis probably similar."

Sipped tea. Too hot. Burnt tongue. Didn't care.

"Brian wants people at RSL. Sixty sheltering there. Food in shops."

"Town's indefensible."

"Yep."

"But you'll help anyway."

"If time permits."

She nodded. Expected answer. "How much ammunition?"

"Magazines full. Grenades—six left. Hummingbird's yours till it's dry."

"Then what?"

"Bat. Or run."

"Not running."

"Didn't think so."

Quiet moment. Insects starting evening chorus. Crickets first, then frogs. Life continuing despite invasion. Obstinate Australian persistence—if drought don't kill it, fire don't kill it, flood don't kill it, probably alien-proof too.

> _Motion sensor. North tree line._

Rifle up. Visor activated. Thermal overlay showed shapes. Small. Low heat signature.

"Threes. Six of them."

> _Probing defenses. Testing response time._

"Autumn, do I need to save ammunition?"

> _Can resupply if you earn more points. Right now you're basically looting my storage._

"Then make them count."

Three shots, three down. Pack scattered. Regrouped at tree line. Watching.

"They're learning."

> _Told you. Not smart—efficient. Pattern recognition without consciousness._

"What stops them?"

> _Dead. Or nothing nearby worth eating. They'll strip biomass till ecosystem collapses, then move._

"Cheery."

> _I do my best._

Full dark now. Stars emerging, southern cross prominent. Moon not up yet. Shapes moved in peripheral vision—there then gone. Eyes adjusting, seeing patterns. Some real. Some fear.

Trix inside shelter testing equipment. Emergency radio, water filtration, air circulation. Methodical. Her way of maintaining control when everything went mad.

Walked perimeter. Chainsaw mark on trees at property line. Territorial marker. Scent marker. Probably useless—Antithesis navigation not scent-based. But human comfort in ritual. Drawing line in dirt: this far, no further.

More movement. Bigger. Four at dam, drinking. Testing water? Searching biomass? Unclear.

Grenades from forty metres. Two throws. First short. Second perfect. Explosion lit dam surface, ripples spreading. When vision cleared, nothing moving.

> _Style points: zero. Effectiveness: acceptable._

"I'm not performing."

> _Everything's performance. You're just bad at it._

"You're bad at shutting up."

> _True. But you'd be bored without me._

"Doubt it."

> _Liar._

Back at caravan. Trix emerged from shelter. "Explosions."

"Fours at dam. Gone now."

"Gone means dead or gone means left?"

"Dead."

"Good." Pause. "Janna's place. Check it."

Stomach dropped. "Why?"

"Haven't seen her. Radio's dead. She's alone up there."

Janna. Seventy-four. Tough as fencing wire. Lived upslope, ran plant nursery. Supplied half valley's gardens.

"Right. Stay here. Shelter if—"

"I know."

Ute up the track. Headlights cutting dark. Janna's place lit—generator running. That was good. Lights meant alive.

Pulled in. Called out. No answer. Door open. Inside: overturned furniture, broken glass, blood spatter on wall. Not much. Some.

Kitchen: more blood. Trail leading to back door.

> _Chief. You don't want—_

"I know."

Back yard: nursery. Raised beds, shade cloth, careful irrigation. All torn apart. Earth churned. Plants shredded. Systematic destruction.

Blood trail ended at compost area. Bones there. Some clothes. Not much else.

Stood long moment. Janna. Showed him native propagation. Shared cuttings. Made him tea with too much sugar. Called him "young man" despite forty-five years and grey in his beard.

> _Autumn's voice quiet. I'm sorry, Chief._

"Yeah."

"What do we do?"

"Incendiary grenade. Fire purifies."

> _That's not—_

"It's what she'd want. Return to earth. Compost metaphor."

Set grenade. Pulled pin. Walked back to ute. Explosion lit sky orange-white. Nursery caught fast—dry timber, shade cloth. Cleansing fire. Bones to ash, ash to soil. Circle closes.

Drove back in silence. Trix looked at face, didn't ask.

"Janna?"

"Gone."

"Dead gone or—"

"Fire."

She understood. Nodded. Moment of silence between them. Valley getting smaller. Everyone knew everyone. Everyone would feel this.

> _Sixty-two people at RSL. Sixty-one now._

"Shut up, Autumn."

> _Making point. Counting down. How many before morning? How many by next week?_

"I said shut up."

> _You don't get to grieve long. That's the job. Move past it or join them._

Harsh. True. Hated her for saying it. Needed to hear it anyway.

"What's next priority?"

> _Your orchard. They'll hit that heavy if they haven't already. Then the dam—water source. Then systematic consumption of every living thing in this valley._

"Orchard then."

Trix grabbed his arm. "You're exhausted. Bleeding. Running on fumes."

"So?"

"So rest. Twenty minutes. Food. Water. Medical check. Then orchard."

"Don't have twenty—"

"Make time or collapse. Which helps more?"

Glared. She glared back. Standoff. She won—she usually did.

Inside caravan: bread, jam, tea. Ate without tasting. Drank without noticing temperature. Fuel. Nothing more.

Trix changed leg dressing. Soaked through. Cleaned again. Fresh wrap. Tighter.

"It's not closing."

"It will."

"Needs stitches."

"Later."

"You'll bleed out."

"Later."

Another glare-off. Another loss.

> _I could cauterize it._

"No."

> _Small medical drone. Localized heat treatment. Seal the wound._

"I said no."

> _Infection risks—_

"Autumn. No."

> _You're impossible._

"You're not the first to notice."

Trix handed him water. "Drink."

Drank. Handed back.

"More."

Drank more.

"Sleep."

"Can't."

"Twenty minutes."

"They'll—"

"Motion sensors. Autumn wakes you. Twenty minutes or I lock you in shelter."

"You wouldn't."

She would. Saw it in her face.

"Fine. Twenty minutes."

Collapsed on caravan bench-bed. Closed eyes. Fell through darkness like stone down well.

Woke to Autumn screaming in his head.

> _CHIEF! ORCHARD! NOW!_

Stumbled out. How long? Watch said thirty minutes. Trix shrugged apologetically.

Grabbed rifle, grenades. Ute started first try—small miracles. Headlights up track toward orchard.

Shapes everywhere. Not Threes or Fours. Bigger. Cow-sized. Six legs. Armored carapace. Systematically stripping fruit trees. Entire orchard under siege.

> _Sixes. Tanky bastards. Soft spots: joints, underbelly. Armor deflects most small arms._

"Grenades?"

> _Work. But you've got four left._

"Then make them count."

Parked ute, headlights illuminating carnage. First grenade at cluster—three Sixes feeding together. Perfect throw. Explosion flipped one, shredded two others. Joints exposed on survivor. Rifle shots into gaps. Down.

Second grenade at pair near apple trees—apples were Trix's favorites. Both caught in blast. Satisfying.

Two grenades left. Dozen Sixes remaining.

> _Conserve. Go for joints. Aim small, miss small._

Sniper work then. Found position behind shed. Stable shooting platform. Methodical. Joint. Joint. Underbelly. Joint. Each shot placed. Each shot counted.

They noticed eventually. Two broke off, headed toward muzzle flash. Big. Fast. Angry.

One grenade between them. Both down.

Last grenade. Eight Sixes left. Not enough.

> _Run._

"No."

> _Chief—_

"My trees. My land. No."

Switched to full auto. Magazine dump into nearest Six—joints, gaps, soft spots. Died hard but died. Changed magazine. Next target. Same approach.

They were converging now. Realizing threat. Not smart—efficient. Eliminate problem.

Last magazine. Four left. Not enough ammunition. Not enough time.

> _New rule interpretation. You're defending established position. That constitutes territory. I can provide defensive emplacements for established territory._

"Do it."

Air shimmered. Automatic turret appeared on shed roof. Another at orchard edge. Both opened up—precise, economical, devastating. Four Sixes down in seconds.

Silence after. Just fire crackling in one tree they'd damaged. Smell of cut grass and cordite. Breathing hard.

> _Eighty points. You're out of the hole._

"How many more waves?"

> _Until you kill them all or they kill you. That's the game, Chief._

Walked through orchard. Damage assessment. Fifteen trees destroyed—roots exposed, bark stripped, branches broken. Thirty damaged but salvageable. Twenty untouched.

Could work with that. Prune damaged sections. Protect remainder. Adapt.

Trix appeared at orchard edge, Hummingbird ready. "Done?"

"For now."

She surveyed damage. "Fifteen years growing those trees."

"Thirty remain."

"Fifteen dead."

"Could be worse."

"Could be better."

"Usually is."

Moment of silence between them. Respect for lost work. Then: "What's next?"

"Dawn. Assess valley. See who's left. Help where possible."

"And after?"

"Keep killing them till they stop coming. Or we're dead. Not complicated."

"No. Simple. Not easy."

"Never is."

Walked back to caravan together. Sky lightening east—purple to grey. Birds starting. Kookaburras first, laughing at the absurdity. Everything dying, birds still laughing. Australia in miniature.

> _Valley census: forty confirmed alive. Fifteen dead or missing. Seven unknown. Sixty-two yesterday._

"Don't."

> _You need to know._

"Later."

> _Now. While you're numb. Easier to process._

Maybe right. Maybe wrong. Either way: the count continued. Janna made sixteen. More would follow. Simple mathematics. Time and exposure. Everyone dies eventually. Usually later. Now sooner.

At caravan: tea again. Trix's solution to everything. Hot tea, bit of sugar. Sip and survive.

"We can't hold this alone."

"No."

"Need others. Coordination. Defense in depth."

"Yep."

"So?"

"Dawn. Go talk to whoever's left. Build something. Or die trying."

"Eloquent."

"Tired."

"Sleep."

"Can't."

"Will."

Collapsed again. Darkness again. This time: dreams. Janna's nursery burning. Bonzer in the flames, watching. Good dog. Protecting still, even gone. Loyalty beyond death.

Woke to Trix shaking shoulder. "Helicopter."

Outside. Rotors loud. Civilian bird, yellow and white. Media markings. Circling valley. Broadcasting something—speakers mounted on skids.

> _Government announcement. Evacuation order. All citizens directed to relocation centers._

"They can fuck off."

> _Legally—_

"I said they can fuck off."

> _Just checking your position. Stubborn git._

Helicopter made three passes. Broadcast repeated. Landed briefly in town—probably dropping someone at RSL. Took off again. Gone.

> _Relocation order legally binding. Non-compliance constitutes—_

"Still don't care."

> _Good. Valley's better without government help anyway. They'd mandate paperwork mid-invasion._

Trix emerged from shelter. "Staying?"

"Staying."

"Thought so." She had packs ready. Supplies. Ammunition. Water. Methodical preparation while he slept. "Others will stay too. Oleksiy. Maria. Lulu's family. Couple more."

"How many?"

"Dozen maybe. Enough for coordination. Not enough for proper defense."

"Then we get clever."

"Define clever."

"Traps. Choke points. Overlapping fields of fire. Make them pay for every meter."

"Scorched earth."

"If necessary."

She nodded. Expected answer. "Then let's get started."

Sun clearing ridge. Valley lit gold. Morning birds in full chorus. Smoke still rising from Janna's place. New day. Same war.

> _Autumn's voice almost gentle. Chief? For what it's worth—you're doing well._

"Don't need reassurance."

> _I know. Giving anyway. Free of charge._

"Nothing's free."

> _This is. Call it investment. You die, I'm stuck with some corpo dickhead who wants to monetize their brand. I'd rather keep the stubborn git who uses chainsaws._

"Touching."

> _I contain multitudes._

"You contain bullshit."

> _That too._

Checked rifle. Grenades. Chainsaw. Armor. All present. All functional. Everything needed to make something bleed.

"Trix. How're you?"

"Alive. Scared. Stubborn. You?"

"Same. Let's stay that way."

"Deal."

Shook on it. Proper handshake, firm and brief. Partners in survival. Married twenty years but this felt like new vows. Simpler ones. Stay alive. Watch each other's backs. Don't die stupid.

> _Valley network establishing. Others checking in. Oleksiy's got helicopter. Maria's organizing medical. Lulu's dad has ammunition stores. Building something here, Chief._

"What're we building?"

> _Whatever survives. Now move. Dawn's when they feed heaviest._

Ute started. Trix in passenger seat, Hummingbird ready. Rifle between knees. Grenades in pockets. Chainsaw in tray. Everything needed.

Drove toward dawn. Toward whatever came next. Simple plan: kill everything trying to kill them. Keep killing till nothing left to kill or nothing left to fight with.

Not complicated. Not easy. Never was.

But doable. Maybe. If lucky and smart and stubborn enough.

Kookaburras laughing in the trees. Mad bird laughter at mad world. He laughed too. Why not? Everything else absurd. Might as well embrace it.

Trix looked at him. "You right?"

"Probably not. Let's go anyway."

"That's the spirit."

> _For the record? I like both of you. Try not to die._

"We'll try."

> _Good enough._

Valley ahead. Forest around. Aliens somewhere in between. Simple geometry. Simple problem.

Kill or be killed. Old as dirt. Probably older.

Drove on.

The squealing hit first. A sow, maybe four hundred kilos, crashing through the lantana with five of the aliens in panicked flight ahead of her. One clutched a dead piglet.

Up the nearest bloodwood like he was sixteen again. Sows don't climb, but they do hold grudges, and this one was ready to murder everything in a hundred-metre radius.

She stopped below, looking for something to kill. The aliens kept running. Smart choice.

"How many points was that?"

> _Seven. Congratulations, you're no longer broke._

"What about a recon drone? If I'm hunting blind—"

> _Sixty points. Keep killing._

They worked through the property systematically, Autumn marking locations as he cleared them. The pattern was obvious: they went for anything lush, anything cultivated. Native bush they mostly ignored—the eucalypts and wattles were too toxic, too low in nutrients. Good. That meant the forest itself might survive even if the Antithesis won.

Small comfort.

> _You're at forty-three points. We should check on your other neighbors._

"Oleksiy's closest. He's—"

> _Armed, capable, and has functional bunker mentality. The other direction._

"Janna." The nursery. Twenty thousand plants in shadecloth houses, irrigation on a timer, her whole livelihood in one spot. "Right."

It took thirty minutes to reach her driveway, mostly due to a detour around a gully full of something he didn't recognize and didn't want to meet yet. When he crested the rise, the silence was total.

The shadecloth was gone. Not torn down—gone. Eaten, presumably. The star pickets stood naked, wire traces on the ground. Not a single plant remained. Her cabin was timber-framed, struc pine because it's cheap. They'd eaten the frame. The roof had collapsed into the space where walls used to be, fibro sheets cracked and twisted, gutters bent like aluminum foil.

He stopped walking.

"Autumn."

> _I know._

The irrigation tanks were twenty thousand litres each, corrugated steel, up on ten-metre stands. Vines trailed from the access hatches. Not lantana—these were grey-green, wrong texture, moving slightly in still air.

"Is she...?"

> _I can't tell from here. Do you want me to—_

"No." Walking again. "Grenades?"

> _Standard fragmentation, three points each._

"Give me three."

They appeared in his hands one at a time, simple spheres with pins. The first pin came free, lobbed underhand toward the nearest tank. The spoon flew free with a bright spang and he was already moving back—

WHAM.

The tank ruptured, water and shredded vine spraying out. Things boiled out of the split seam, small and fast, heading straight for him. Out came the second pin, two, three, he threw it into the mass.

WHAM.

The third went into the far tank while they were still reforming. That one actually tumbled into the hatch, and when it went off the entire tank bulged, seams splitting, water pouring out in sheets.

Nothing else moved.

Wait. Wait. Still nothing.

"I need something for cleanup. Something that'll—"

> _Burn it?_

"Burn it."

> _Incendiary grenade, five points._

"One for now."

He walked to where the cabin used to be, close enough to see inside the wreckage. The bed frame was steel, still intact. Everything else was gone. No body. Maybe she'd gotten out, gone to neighbors, wasn't home when—

Something white in the wreckage. Bone. Femur, by the size.

"Autumn."

> _I see it._

"Incendiary."

> _Are you—_

"She'd want a proper fire. Better than rotting in the wreckage."

The grenade appeared. He pulled the pin, set it carefully in the center of the collapse, and walked away. Behind him, the whump of ignition, then the crackle of fire finding fibro and dried timber and beginning to properly burn.

By the time he reached the driveway, smoke rose black and thick. Old hardwood would burn for hours, hot enough to reduce anything organic to ash. No gravestone, no words. Just smoke rising into the empty sky.

> _I'm sorry._

"Yeah."

They walked back toward home in silence. After a while, Autumn spoke again.

> _You're at thirty-two points. You earned more clearing her property._

"Doesn't feel like it."

> _It never does. But you gave her a clean end. That's not nothing._

No answer, nothing to say. He'd killed some aliens, burned a body, and walked away. Hurrah for the Brave New World.

> _We should talk about defensive strategy._

"Later. I want to know whether Trixie's alright."

> _She is. The shelter monitors show her inside, vital signs normal. She's reading._

"Reading what?"

> _The emergency manual I included. She's taking notes._

That sounded like Trixie. End of the world, alien invasion, hiding in a bunker—might as well study. Something unclenched in his chest.

"What's our point total?"

> _Thirty-two. Enough for basic defensive equipment, not enough for proper infrastructure._

"What do I need?"

> _To keep killing things until you can afford sensors, automated defense, and proper fortifications. But you already knew that._

"Yeah."

The walk back stretched longer than he remembered. His leg was throbbing again, Brian's field dressing soaked through. The armor jacket from Autumn's "personal collection" was keeping him upright, some kind of medical monitoring built in, but there were limits to what gear could fix.

The caravan clearing appeared through the trees. Trixie was outside the shelter, Hummingbird in hand, watching his approach with the kind of focus that said she'd been waiting and worrying.

"You're late."

"Had to make a stop."

"You're bleeding."

"Brian patched it. It's fine."

"It's not fine. Get inside." She pointed at the shelter. "There's a proper medical kit in there and I've read the manual. Sit down and let me fix what you've broken."

She worked efficiently, cutting away the old bandage, cleaning the wound again, applying something that stung like hell but probably prevented infection. New bandage, properly wrapped, tighter than Brian's.

"There. Now you'll live long enough to do something else stupid."

"That's the plan."

She looked at him, really looked, and her expression softened slightly. "You went to town. Got the chainsaw. Came back past Janna's."

"How did you—"

"You've got ash on your jacket. And that look you get when things are worse than you want to admit." She sat beside him on the shelter's step. "She didn't make it, did she?"

"No."

"Anyone else?"

"Brian's alive. Sixty people sheltering at the RSL. Haven't checked the others yet."

"Then that's what we do next. We check on everyone, we help who we can, and we don't quit until either the aliens are dead or we are."

He stared at his wife of twenty-five years, who'd managed his money and his memory and his tendency to acquire chainsaws, who'd turned cramped caravans into homes and refused to shoot wallabies even when they ate her garden.

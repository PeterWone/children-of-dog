Trucks rolled in on a Tuesday morning, the diesel rumble of heavy machinery announcing them long before they crested the final rise into the valley. He watched from his clearing as the convoy navigated the track with varying degrees of success—three heavy vehicles carrying containerized demountables, followed by a passenger van full of scientists who looked considerably less confident than they had during the delegation visit.

Oleksiy was already at the chosen site when he arrived, his weathered face showing the particular satisfaction of someone who'd correctly predicted disaster. The lead truck had managed to bog itself trying to back into position, its rear wheels spinning uselessly in soil that looked solid but had turned treacherous under weight.

"City drivers," Oleksiy observed with the tone of someone delivering a medical diagnosis. "They think four-wheel drive means they can go anywhere."

Dr. James Morrison emerged from the passenger van looking harried and defensive, his materials science credentials clearly not extending to practical construction knowledge. "The delivery company assured us they had experience with remote sites—"

"Remote sites with proper roads," Oleksiy interrupted. "This is bush. Different thing." He studied the bogged truck with the assessment of someone who'd extracted vehicles from worse situations. "You have chains?"

The blank looks from the scientists suggested that chains had not featured prominently in their logistical planning. He suppressed a sigh and opened his tactical interface.

"Autumn, how many points to fabricate heavy-duty recovery chains?"

> _Two points, and five for the PTO winch you also need. You called Gerry. He's on his way down with his tractor._

He wondered whether there was any point telling her again that flawless impersonation over the radio was going to cause trouble, but the equipment materialized and pushed the thought from his mind. Twenty meters of chain rated for vehicle recovery, a portable winch assembly, and a selection of shackles and straps that Oleksiy nodded at approvingly.

"Now we work," the Ukrainian announced, organizing the recovery with the calm authority of someone who'd learned construction management through decades of actual building rather than project management software.

Two hours later, all three trucks were positioned and the scientists had received a practical education in how pressure can trigger local phase transition in wet clay. And more importantly, what to do about it. Dr. Morrison made copious notes while Dr. Patricia Kellerman helped with chains and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the hands-on work. Dr. Marcus Chen, the youngest and most academic of the researchers, maintained an air of wounded dignity that suggested he felt manual labor was beneath his qualifications.

"The demountables need proper foundations," Oleksiy announced, surveying the three large containers now positioned on Oleksiy's terrace. "Ground is good here, granite underneath, but you don't put buildings on dirt. Deep footings, much concrete, do it right."

Morrison consulted his tablet with increasing agitation. "The budget allows for basic leveling and securing, not full foundation work. We were told the containers could be placed directly on prepared ground—"

"In year you have crack, in two years structural failure. In three years people injured when something breaks." Oleksiy's pronouncement carried the weight of experience watching shortcuts turn expensive. "You want fast and cheap, or done right? Always safety, safety, safety till quote, then cheap, cheap, cheap like leetle bird."

The question hung in the morning air while the scientists engaged in a hurried consultation that involved much tablet-checking and anxious glances at budgets and timelines. He watched the bureaucratic panic with familiar resignation, recognizing the moment when theoretical planning met practical reality.

"How much would proper foundations cost?" Dr. Singh asked, her pragmatic voice cutting through the anxious murmuring.

Oleksiy considered, mentally calculating materials and labor with the speed of someone who'd estimated thousands of projects. His English grammar improved miraculously for a sensible question. "Materials, perhaps five thousand if we are clever. Labor, I do for beer and good company. But it takes time—three, four days to do properly."

"The timeline—" Morrison began.

"The timeline was guesswork by people with half the facts and none of the responsibility," Amanda interrupted with blunt authority. "We do this right or not at all. I'll handle the budget."

The relief on Morrison's face suggested he'd been hoping someone with authority would make the decision he knew was correct but lacked the confidence to enforce. He found himself revising his assessment of the materials scientist upward—Morrison knew enough to recognize expertise when he saw it, even if his academic background hadn't prepared him for construction.

Over the next four days, the valley transformed into a construction site unremarkable in the suburbs but surreal in the isolated bush. Oleksiy directed operations with the calm amusement of a virtuoso teaching clever children.

Dr. Singh threw herself into the work with the enthusiasm of someone who'd missed physical labor, remediation experience leaving her comfortable with shovels and concrete mixers. Kellerman surprised everyone by having a farm background, her xenobiology credentials built on foundations of practical agriculture. Even young Dr. Chen eventually stopped sulking and discovered that mixing concrete was both simpler and more satisfying than his theoretical training had led him to expect.

He found himself drafted as general assistant, supplier of materials through Autumn's catalog access, and occasional voice of reason when academic enthusiasm outpaced structural reality. Trix appeared regularly with food and drinks, her hospitality transforming the construction site into something approaching community gathering.

The Macintyres' boys showed up on the second day, drawn by curiosity and the universal male attraction to large machinery and construction projects. The young farmers watched the scientists struggle with basic tasks, offered occasional advice with the casual superiority of people who'd been doing physical work since childhood, and generally served as audience for what was rapidly becoming the valley's most entertaining spectacle.

"They're not completely useless," the older Macintyre observed to him on the third day, his tone suggesting this was significant praise. "Soft, but they do listen. Eventually. Dad says academics are usually too proud to learn anything that didn't come from books."

He watched Dr. Chen struggle to level a foundation form under Oleksiy's patient instruction, remembering his own learning curve when he'd first attempted to build in the bush. "Some people need to discover their assumptions were wrong before they can learn what's actually true. The smart ones figure it out."

By the fourth day, three concrete pads sat curing in the sun, their surfaces level within tolerances that satisfied even Oleksiy's exacting standards. Touch in four, walk in twelve, drive in seven, they learnt. Hours, hours, days. Drive in two days, he said. Can, but not smart.

The scientists were marking out the water tower site when they encountered their first immovable object — a granite boulder the size of a small car, right where the foundation needed to be. They weren't quite sure _why_ it had to be just there. Oleksiy's explanation was characteristically terse and by then their confidence in his judgement put it beyond argument. Not beyond _question_, but they were tired. They tried crowbars, levers, all hands on one side pushing while Morrison quoted mechanical advantage calculations. The rock didn't give an inch.

The older Macintyre boy watched from a comfortable distance, arms crossed, amused. "You could try asking it nicely."

Dr. Chen, sweating and frustrated, looked ready to suggest explosives. Possibly rectally, he didn't appreciate the remark.

Oleksiy appeared twenty minutes later on his excavator, the diesel rumble announcing him long before the machine crested the rise. He surveyed the scene with the expression of someone watching children discover gravity was still working, then shut off the engine.

"Who wants to learn?"

The scientists exchanged glances. Chen stared at the excavator with naked longing but didn't move, academic fear warring with desire.

Dr. Kellerman, without looking at him, said: "Chen will."

"I—" Chen started.

"Time to shine." Not a question. She'd seen him looking.

Oleksiy nodded. "Good. Come."

Chen approached the excavator like someone granted access to a temple. Oleksiy climbed up, gestured for Chen to follow, and spent five minutes explaining controls with the economy of someone who'd taught this before.

"Not shovel. Is hand. You pick up rock like egg." Oleksiy demonstrated, the bucket curling with surprising delicacy. "Hydraulics give you strength, but you give finesse. Gentle, gentle. Rock has patience, you must too."

He climbed down, leaving Chen in the operator's seat. "Now you try. I watch."

Chen's first attempts were jerky, the bucket swinging wide then overcorrecting. But Oleksiy called corrections with patient precision, and Chen's engineering background translated theory into practice faster than manual labor had. He found the rhythm—smooth extension, controlled curl, the satisfying chunk of steel meeting stone.

"Good. Now position bucket at base, far side. You will pull toward you, not lift." Oleksiy guided him through approach angles and pressure application, the boulder shifting incrementally as Chen worked. "Feel when it moves. Listen to machine. It tells you everything."

Fifteen minutes later, Chen lifted the boulder clear of the foundation site, swung it in a controlled arc, and set it down exactly where Oleksiy indicated. He sat there for a moment, hands still on controls, face flushed with something between exhilaration and disbelief.

When he climbed down, his wire-rimmed glasses were dusty and his khakis were properly filthy. He looked at the excavator, then the displaced boulder, then his colleagues.

"I spent six years getting my doctorate studying alien ecosystems." He gestured at the excavator with something approaching reverence. "Now I'm out here deploying weapons of mass construction. And it's the most fun I've had in _years_."

The older Macintyre nodded with the approval of someone watching a city kid discover real work. "Not bad for a boffin."

Oleksiy clapped Chen on the shoulder. "Da. Good student. Tomorrow, water tower foundation. More rocks."

Chen's response was immediate and eager. "I'm in."

Dr. Kellerman watched with arms crossed and a satisfied smile. "Told you."

Containerised demountables wouldn't turn up for another four days. Before they did, said Oleksiy, level pads were required for the crane. There was some debate about how necessary this was. Cranes have levelling legs. Then Chen shouted intellectual victory and accused the crafty old man of changing the lay of the land so that water wouldn't sit and soften.

"Good," said the inscrutable old tree stump. "You are thinking."

Dr Chen was keen to get started, but Oleksiy shook his head. "No time. I dig. Faster."

Dr. Singh surveyed the pads with satisfaction, then frowned. "Water supply. We've been so focused on foundations we haven't thought about water."

Morrison consulted his tablet. "The specifications call for connection to a supply with no more than seven hundred kilopascals—"

He was interrupted by lumber jacket.

"No mains out here. Your choices are roof water, creek water, or bore water. Roof's better drinking but yer still need a couple of tanks."

The scientists exchanged glances. Dr. Kellerman, her farm background showing, asked the practical question: "What's the creek flow like year-round? Can we tap it directly?"

"Can," Oleksiy said, "but not smart. After heavy rain, mud, weeds, no good for lab. Need settling tank."

"How large?" Morrison was already making notes.

Oleksiy considered, calculating. "Three buildings, fifteen people, equipment wash, sanitation... six thousand litres, no less. Pump from creek, inlet two-thirds up tank. One hundred four millimetre dump valve at bottom for mud. Tap half metre up."

Dr. Chen, who'd been quiet since his transformation into competent laborer, spoke up. "Why two-thirds up? Why not feed at the top? And why one hundred and _four_ millimetres?"

"Settlement," Oleksiy explained, gesturing with his hands. "Water enters here, dirty. Mud falls, gathers below inlet. Tap from top. Every few weeks, open valve. Mud out. Simple. Nothing to break."

His lips pursed and mischief danced in his eyes. "As for size, problem is stupid Americans. One hundred four millimetre, four inch."

"That's actually elegant," Dr. Singh said, ignoring the dig and sketching in her notebook. "Passive filtration through gravity and time."

"Old way is best," Oleksiy agreed. "Works everywhere, forever. Until concrete fails, which is _long_ time when build right."

He watched the discussion with interest. "Cylinder will work, but you build from start, you have better choice."

"Better how?" Morrison asked, his earlier defensiveness replaced by genuine curiosity.

He grabbed a stick and sketched in the dirt. "Shape like city water tower. Cone at top where water sits, hollow column down middle. Stabilize with legs at base, or guy wires."

Oleksiy leaned forward. "Cone is arch, other way, very strong. Column protects pipes, bears load. Legs stabilise for wind load. Column is segments stacked and sealed. Cone top is separate pieces with gaskets and compression bands. When piece fails, replace that, not whole tank."

Dr. Kellerman was sketching rapidly. "How do you seal the cone panels?"

"Rubber gaskets between panels, steel compression bands around the outside. Same principle as barrel hoops," he explained. "Water pushes against bands, everything tight. Mud in  bottom of cone, dump valve. Intake line through the column, clean water out near top, pipes in column, no freeze."

"And this is proven tech?" Morrison asked, still making notes.

"City water towers work on the same principle," said the Vanguard. "We're scaling it down and simplifying it. Three metres of head pressure is enough for your needs, and the cone can be sized for whatever capacity you want." He did some math. "If its a 45 degree cone and it's five metres high, that's a hundred and thirty tonnes of water."

Oleksiy interrupted him.

"Head too low. Main pressure twenty-five."

"Only if you let regulators plan your plumbing. _V = IR_ for hydraulic systems too. Inch throughout and you have the same flow at one sixth the pressure."

"Da. Math is wrong but you have point." The old Slav nodded slowly, turning to Morrison. "Three metre higher than highest tap. Use larger pipe, shorter tower, safer, cheaper, easy build. But maybe problems for fit-out."

"How so?"

"Dishwasher, washing machine, made for mains pressure. Inlet twelve millimetre. Easy fix, build further up hill."

"Wait, wait—" Chen leaned forward, eyes bright. "How does the water get from the creek up to the giant cone thing? Water only runs _downhill_."

Oleksiy gave him a nod of genuine approval. For drainage it could take apprentices six months to figure that one out. "Pump from settling tank. Large pipe, best flow. Float switch, hysteresis."

Dr. Singh was calculating. "Materials cost?"

"We could build a windmill!" interrupted Chen, on a roll now. "But your face says no. What have I left out?"

"Is forest. No wind in forest."

"Oh."

Oleksiy shrugged; but for the trees it might have been a good idea. He turned to Dr. Singh. "Concrete, much steel, rubber gaskets, valves, pipes. Maybe eight, nine thousand dollars with good source. Labor..." he shrugged. "I teach, you build. Good experience."

"_Us?!_," Dr. Chen looked completely unconvinced. "Are you sure that's a good idea? 'Collapsing water tower' sounds like a disaster movie."

"I watch. Fix mistakes. You learn."

"And it would be visible," Dr. Kellerman observed. "A landmark."

"A landmark," he said. "Visible infrastructure means the site is thriving, professional, maintained. Plus it becomes a navigation reference. 'The research station with the water tower.' People will remember that."

The Vanguard poked his nose into the conversation again. "Do you even need the column? Couldn't we build the cone on the ground at the top of the slope?"

It wasn't an awful idea. Construction was easier and it didn't require so much steel and concrete. Mostly it boiled down to where you wanted water pressure. From the ridge to the creek was a drop of eighty metres. If they sat it on the ridge then you'd need to be a quarter the way down the slope for town pressure. Which meant you couldn't build higher. After a while they decided on a three metre column, four metres in diameter, with a five metre rise to the rim of a forty-five degree cone. 

Morrison was quiet for a moment, reviewing his notes and budget. "We'll need to revise the budget again. Amanda won't be pleased."

"Amanda will be fine with it," Dr. Singh said firmly. "She authorized proper foundations because they were necessary. Water supply is just as necessary. Would you rather we scrimp now and deal with contamination issues in six months?"

"No," Morrison admitted. "You're right. I'll prepare the documentation tonight."

Oleksiy nodded approvingly. "Is good. We build foundations, demountables go up, then we build water tower. Strong foundations. Your children's children will use these buildings." 

He was wrong about that.

They pondered the novel concept of building for the ages.

Philosophy had to wait. Oleksiy was already discussing how to assemble fifty tonnes of masonry ten metres in the air. They had already changed the site twice and he was on his radio to Gerry, who didn't answer so he tried a phone instead, and got permission to put it up in the clearing near the little cabin. Instead of making the tower taller they shortened it considerably and moved it up the hill. Gerry's road meant a concrete truck could reach the site, instead of ferrying the concrete one loader bucket at at time. Chen looked vaguely disappointed at this news.

They still hadn't thrashed out assembly of the saucer but Oleksiy had a plan and that was plenty good enough for them.

"Tomorrow, demountables arrive," Oleksiy announced, pulling them back to the present. "Tonight, rest. You earned it."

"Good work," Oleksiy announced to the assembled scientists, his weathered face showing genuine approval. "You learn fast. Tomorrow, place buildings, bolt in place. Laboratories. Then, we build something worth looking at."

The scientists, sweaty and exhausted, looked inordinately pleased with themselves. 

That evening, as the 'kids' departed for their accommodations in the distant town, Oleksiy shared a beer with the Vanguard. They watched the shadows lengthen. The sun painted the trees amber and gold.

"They'll do," Oleksiy said finally. 

"High praise from you," he observed.

The Ukrainian shrugged with the gesture of someone who'd learned to assess people by their actions rather than credentials. "Seen worse. These know they do not know everything."

Up it went, and up it stayed. There was much rejoicing.

> _That was educational._ 

"How so?"

> _I predicted three-point-seven days for foundation work based on standard construction timelines and available labor. Oleksiy completed it in four despite the scientists' inexperience. His efficiency exceeds industry standards by approximately eighteen percent._

"He's had fifty years of practice."

> _Interesting. Human expertise can't be fully modeled without accounting for accumulated practical wisdom that exists outside formal knowledge structures._

Tomorrow the demountables would arrive. Transformation would continue. But tonight, the bush reclaimed its quiet, indifferent to human plans and the complications they attracted.

In the distance, a boobook owl called, and somewhere nearby, Oleksiy explained to Sissi why retirement was so busy. She wouldn't understand, but she'd feed them anyway. It was what she did.

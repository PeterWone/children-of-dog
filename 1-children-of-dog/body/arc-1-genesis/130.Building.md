Trucks rolled in on a Tuesday morning, the diesel rumble of heavy machinery announcing them long before they crested the final rise into the valley. He watched from his clearing as the convoy navigated the track with varying degrees of success—three heavy vehicles carrying containerized demountables, followed by a passenger van full of scientists who looked considerably less confident than they had during the delegation visit.

Oleksiy was already at the chosen site when he arrived, his weathered face showing the particular satisfaction of someone who'd correctly predicted disaster. The lead truck had managed to bog itself trying to back into position, its rear wheels spinning uselessly in soil that looked solid but had turned treacherous under weight.

"City drivers," Oleksiy observed with the tone of someone delivering a medical diagnosis. "They think four-wheel drive means they can go anywhere."

Dr. James Morrison emerged from the passenger van looking harried and defensive, his materials science credentials clearly not extending to practical construction knowledge. "The delivery company assured us they had experience with remote sites—"

"Remote sites with proper roads," Oleksiy interrupted. "This is bush. Different thing." He studied the bogged truck with the assessment of someone who'd extracted vehicles from worse situations. "You have chains?"

The blank looks from the scientists suggested that chains had not featured prominently in their logistical planning. He suppressed a sigh and opened his tactical interface.

"Autumn, how many points to fabricate heavy-duty recovery chains?"

> _Two points, and five for the PTO winch you also need. You called Gerry. He's on his way down with his tractor._

He wondered whether there was any point telling her again that flawless impersonation over the radio was going to cause trouble, but the equipment materialized and pushed the thought from his mind. Twenty meters of chain rated for vehicle recovery, a portable winch assembly, and a selection of shackles and straps that Oleksiy nodded at approvingly.

"Now we work," the Ukrainian announced, organizing the recovery with the calm authority of someone who'd learned construction management through decades of actual building rather than project management software.

Two hours later, all three trucks were positioned and the scientists had received a practical education in how pressure can trigger local phase transition in wet clay. And more importantly, what to do about it. Dr. Morrison made copious notes while Dr. Patricia Kellerman helped with chains and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the hands-on work. Dr. Marcus Chen, the youngest and most academic of the researchers, maintained an air of wounded dignity that suggested he felt manual labor was beneath his qualifications.

"The demountables need proper foundations," Oleksiy announced, surveying the three large containers now positioned on Oleksiy's terrace. "Ground is good here, granite underneath, but you don't put buildings on dirt. Deep footings, much concrete, do it right."

Morrison consulted his tablet with increasing agitation. "The budget allows for basic leveling and securing, not full foundation work. We were told the containers could be placed directly on prepared ground—"

"In year you have crack, in two years structural failure. In three years people injured when something breaks." Oleksiy's pronouncement carried the weight of experience watching shortcuts turn expensive. "You want fast and cheap, or done right? Always safety, safety, safety till quote, then cheap, cheap, cheap like leetle bird."

The question hung in the morning air while the scientists engaged in a hurried consultation that involved much tablet-checking and anxious glances at budgets and timelines. He watched the bureaucratic panic with familiar resignation, recognizing the moment when theoretical planning met practical reality.

"How much would proper foundations cost?" Dr. Singh asked, her pragmatic voice cutting through the anxious murmuring.

Oleksiy considered, mentally calculating materials and labor with the speed of someone who'd estimated thousands of projects. His English grammar improved miraculously for a sensible question. "Materials, perhaps five thousand if we are clever. Labor, I do for beer and good company. But it takes time—three, four days to do properly."

"The timeline—" Morrison began.

"The timeline was guesswork by people with half the facts and none of the responsibility," Amanda interrupted with blunt authority. "We do this right or not at all. I'll handle the budget."

The relief on Morrison's face suggested he'd been hoping someone with authority would make the decision he knew was correct but lacked the confidence to enforce. He found himself revising his assessment of the materials scientist upward—Morrison knew enough to recognize expertise when he saw it, even if his academic background hadn't prepared him for construction.

Over the next four days, the valley transformed into a construction site unremarkable in the suburbs but surreal in the isolated bush. Oleksiy directed operations with the calm amusement of a virtuoso teaching clever children.

Dr. Singh threw herself into the work with the enthusiasm of someone who'd missed physical labor, remediation experience leaving her comfortable with shovels and concrete mixers. Kellerman surprised everyone by with a farm background, her xenobiology credentials built on foundations of practical agriculture. Even young Dr. Chen eventually stopped sulking and discovered that mixing concrete was both simpler and more satisfying than his theoretical training had led him to expect.

He found himself drafted as general assistant, supplier of materials through Autumn's catalog access, and occasional voice of reason when academic enthusiasm outpaced structural reality. Trix appeared regularly with food and drinks, her hospitality transforming the construction site into something approaching community gathering.

The Macintyres' boys showed up on the second day, drawn by curiosity and the universal male attraction to large machinery and construction projects. The young farmers watched the scientists struggle with basic tasks, offered occasional advice with the casual superiority of people who'd been doing physical work since childhood, and generally served as audience for what was rapidly becoming the valley's most entertaining spectacle.

"They're not completely useless," the older Macintyre observed to him on the third day, his tone suggesting this was significant praise. "Soft, but they do listen. Eventually. Dad says academics are usually too proud to learn anything that didn't come from books."

He watched Dr. Chen struggle to level a foundation form under Oleksiy's patient instruction, remembering his own learning curve when he'd first attempted to build in the bush. "Some people need to discover their assumptions were wrong before they can learn what's actually true. The smart ones figure it out."

By the fourth day, three concrete pads sat curing in the sun, their surfaces level within tolerances that satisfied even Oleksiy's exacting standards. Touch in four, walk in twelve, drive in seven, they learnt. Hours, hours, days. Drive in two days, he said, can but not smart. 

The containerized demountables would arrive in four days to be craned into position, but the foundations were complete, proper, and would still be solid decades hence.

Dr. Singh stood surveying the pads with satisfaction, then frowned. "Water supply. We've been so focused on foundations we haven't properly discussed water infrastructure."

Morrison consulted his tablet. "The specifications call for connection to existing valley water systems—"

"There are no valley water systems," he interrupted. "Each property runs off roof water, creek water, or bore water. You'll need your own supply."

The scientists exchanged glances. Dr. Kellerman, her farm background showing, asked the practical question: "What's the creek flow like year-round? Can we tap it directly?"

"Can," Oleksiy said, "but not smart. Creek is clean now, but after heavy rain? Full of mud, weeds, no good for lab. Need settling tank."

"How large?" Morrison was already making notes.

Oleksiy considered, calculating. "Three buildings, maybe fifteen people, equipment wash, sanitation... minimum six thousand litres. Need more than this. Feed from creek two-thirds up the tank, tap top, three metres tall. One hundred four millimetre dump valve at bottom for mud."

Dr. Chen, who'd been quiet since his transformation into competent laborer, spoke up. "Why two-thirds up? Why not feed at the top? And why one hundred and _four_ millimetres?"

"Settlement," Oleksiy explained, gesturing with his hands. "Water enters here, dirty. Mud falls out, accumulates below inlet. Clean water rises, you tap from top. Every few weeks, open dump valve, flush accumulated sediment. Simple, reliable, no moving part to break."

His lips pursed and mischief danced in his eyes. "As for size, problem is stupid Americans. One hundred four millimetre, four inch."

"That's actually elegant," Dr. Singh said, ignoring the dig and sketching in her notebook. "Passive filtration through gravity and time."

"Old way is best," Oleksiy agreed. "Works everywhere, forever. Until concrete fails, which is _long_ time when build right."

He watched the discussion with interest. "Cylinder will work, but you build from start, you have better choice."

"Better how?" Morrison asked, his earlier defensiveness replaced by genuine curiosity.

He grabbed a stick and sketched in the dirt. "Shape like city water tower. Cone at top where water sits, hollow column down middle. Stabilize with legs at base, or guy wires."

Oleksiy leaned forward. "Cone is arch, other way, very strong. Column protects pipes, bears load. Legs stabilise for wind load. Column is segments stacked and sealed. Cone top is separate pieces with gaskets and compression bands. When piece fails, replace that, not whole tank."

Dr. Kellerman was sketching rapidly. "How do you seal the cone panels?"

"Rubber gaskets between panels, steel compression bands around the outside. Same principle as barrel hoops," he explained. "Water pushes against bands, everything tight. Mud in  bottom of the cone. Dump valve there, intake line through the column, clean water out near top, inside for no freeze."

"And this is proven technology?" Morrison asked, still making notes.

"City water towers work on the same principle," he said. "We're scaling it _down_ and simplifying it. Three metres of head pressure is enough for your needs, and the cone can be sized for whatever capacity you want. Six thousand litres, ten thousand, whatever."

Oleksiy interrupted him.

"Three metres head too low. Main pressure twenty-five."

He was undeterred. "Only if you let regulators plan your plumbing. _V = IR_ for hydraulic systems too. Inch throughout and you have the same flow at one sixth the pressure."

"Da. Math is wrong but he has point." The old Slav nodded slowly, turning to Morrison. "Three metre higher than highest tap. Use larger pipe, shorter tower, safer, cheaper, easy build."

Dr. Singh was calculating. "Materials cost?"

"Concrete, much steel, rubber gaskets, valves, pipes," Oleksiy listed. "Maybe eight, nine thousand dollars with good source. Labor..." he shrugged. "I teach, you build. Good experience."

"_Us?!_," Dr. Chen looked completely unconvinced. "Are you sure that's a good idea? 'Collapsing water tower' sounds like a disaster movie."

"I watch. Fix mistakes. You learn."

"And it would be visible," Dr. Kellerman observed. "A landmark."

"A landmark," he said. "Visible infrastructure means the site is thriving, professional, maintained. Plus it becomes a navigation reference. 'The research station with the water tower.' People will remember that."

Morrison was quiet for a moment, reviewing his notes and budget. "We'll need to revise the budget again. Amanda won't be pleased."

"Amanda will be fine with it," Dr. Singh said firmly. "She authorized proper foundations because they were necessary. Water supply is just as necessary. Would you rather we scrimp now and deal with contamination issues in six months?"

"No," Morrison admitted. "You're right. I'll prepare the documentation tonight."

Oleksiy nodded approvingly. "Is good. We build foundations for demountables, demountables go up, then we build water tower. Everything proper, everything right. Your children's children will use these buildings."

The scientists looked at each other, something shifting in their expressions. They'd come to the valley thinking in terms of temporary research stations and limited-term projects. But Oleksiy spoke of generations, of infrastructure built to outlast careers and lifetimes. It was a different way of thinking about their work.

"Build it to last," Dr. Kellerman said softly, and the others nodded.

They tried to ask more questions but Oleksiy and he were already discussing how to assemble fifty tonnes of masonry twenty metres in the air. They had already changed the site twice and he was on his radio to Gerry, who didn't answer so he tried a phone instead, and got permission to put it up in the clearing near the little cabin. Instead of making the tower taller they shortened it and moved it up the hill, incidentally getting access via Gerry's road for a concrete truck. Chen looked quite relieved by that.

They still hadn't thrashed out assembly of the saucer but Oleksiy announced he had a plan and that was plenty good enough for him.

"Tomorrow demountables arrive," Oleksiy announced, pulling them back to immediate concerns. "Tonight, you rest. You earned it."

"Good work," Oleksiy announced to the assembled scientists, his weathered face showing genuine approval. "You learn fast. Tomorrow we position buildings, then you have laboratories. And after that, we build something worth looking at."

The scientists, sweaty and exhausted, looked inordinately pleased with themselves. Dr. Chen in particular had transformed over four days from affronted academic to competent laborer, his wire-rimmed glasses now secured with a strap and his khakis properly dusty. Watching his transformation, he recognized something he'd seen in himself: the satisfaction that came from creating something tangible rather than theoretical.

That evening, as the scientists departed for their accommodations in the distant town, he and Oleksiy shared beer in the lengthening shadows, watching the sun paint the eucalyptus in amber and gold.

"They'll be okay," Oleksiy said finally. "Not useless. Just... educated past their experience. But they learn."

"High praise from you," he observed.

The Ukrainian shrugged with the gesture of someone who'd learned to assess people by their actions rather than credentials. "Have worked with worse. At least these ones know they do not know everything. Dangerous ones are those who know all."

He reflected on the past four days, watching construction transform theoretical plans into physical reality. The scientists had arrived with assumptions about how work should happen, based on theories and regulations and budget projections. But Oleksiy had shown them the truth: reality didn't care about theories, and successful projects adapted plans to conditions rather than forcing conditions to match plans.

Up it went, and up it stayed. There was much rejoicing.

> _That was educational,_ Autumn observed as he watched the last light fade from the western ridge.

"How so?"

> _I'd calculated three-point-seven days for foundation work based on standard construction timelines and available labor. Oleksiy completed it in four despite the scientists' inexperience. His efficiency exceeds industry standards by approximately eighteen percent._

"He's had fifty years of practice," he pointed out. "And he doesn't waste time on unnecessary process."

> _Interesting. Human expertise can't be fully modeled without accounting for accumulated practical wisdom that exists outside formal knowledge structures._

He smiled at the AI's discovery that experience mattered in ways that couldn't be reduced to calculations. It was a lesson the scientists had learned over four days with shovels and concrete — reality was more complicated than theory, and the people who worked with it directly often understood it better than the experts who studied it from distance.

Tomorrow the demountables would arrive, and the valley's new residents would begin transforming shipping containers into laboratories. But tonight, the bush reclaimed its quiet, indifferent to human plans and the complications they attracted.

In the distance, a boobook owl called, and somewhere nearby, Oleksiy was probably explaining to Sissi why their retirement had suddenly become more interesting. She wouldn't understand, but she'd feed them anyway if they came calling. It was what she did.

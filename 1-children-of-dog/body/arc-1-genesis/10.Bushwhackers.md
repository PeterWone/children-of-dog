The morning air still held yesterday's rain, earthy and clean, as they made their way back to base camp. Trix sat cross-legged by the fire, methodically sharpening her knives — a ritual Forest had come to recognise as her way of processing stress. The previous night's encounter had shaken her more than she'd admit, though she'd never say so. Pride ran deep in her bloodline, the quiet strength of her island heritage tempered by the practical toughness that came from crossing the Tasman to carve out a life in Australian bush country.

Forest set the fleshmelters down beside her with the kind of deliberate care you use when handling both dangerous weapons and fragile people. "These are fire-and-forget," he said, keeping his voice level, instructional. "Point, squeeze, step back. The chemical reaction does the rest. Get back after you trigger it. At least three metres."

She nodded, turning one over in her hands with the same attention she'd given her knives. There was something primal about the way she evaluated tools — not just their function, but their weight, their balance, how they'd feel after hours of use. This came from a family that had carved lives from unforgiving country with little more than determination and steel.

The demonstration was brief. Trix absorbed information the way drought-cracked earth accepts rain—quickly, completely, with little show but profound effect. Within minutes she had the rhythm of it, the casual competence that marked someone who'd grown up knowing that survival often came down to how quickly you could learn something new.

The citrus grove at the high creek bore the scars of the previous night's violence. Saplings that had taken three years to establish lay trampled, their tender bark stripped away by hungry alien mouths. Forest dragged the carcasses clear of the survivors, each one a small tragedy of lost time and patient care. The work was heavy — alien corpses weren't light — but his lean frame moved with deceptive strength, individual muscles playing visibly beneath the worn fabric of his lumberjacket as he hauled the bodies clear. The sanitising solution hissed against alien flesh, reducing complex bio-chemistry to inert residue with the efficiency that marked all Protectorate technology.

Trixie moved among the victims with secateurs, brutal in her mercy. She wasn't killing them, quite the opposite. It would be a while before they grew back, and taking off all the damage made the rootbase relatively larger than the injured plant.

Autumn's voice crackled through the radio as he worked. She'd already contacted Brian, but he was ahead of them — smoke rising from his property like an exclamation mark against the morning sky. The man had been fighting his own war while they'd been busy elsewhere. In this country, self-reliance wasn't a philosophy. It was survival. You dealt with your own problems because by the time help arrived, problems had usually dealt with you.

Janna's battered van turning into her driveway. Forest followed without thinking, recognising the slumped shoulders of someone carrying more weight than they could bear. Her nursery — a lifetime's work condensed into neat rows of native seedlings — lay in ruins. Broken pots, scattered soil, and the particular devastation that comes when something you've nurtured is destroyed not by malice but by simple, incomprehensible hunger.

She stood among the wreckage, not crying but hollow-eyed in the way of people processing loss too large for immediate tears. Janna had never been wealthy—her nursery existed on the thin margins of passion projects and small-town economics. A bank loan that had seemed manageable when spread across a season's projected sales now loomed like a mountain. 

"Autumn? Hummingbird and a melter for the lady, I think. How's our balance?"

"Who are you talking to?" Janna's voice carried the brittle edge of someone whose world had shifted overnight.

The car stereo came alive with Jen Taylor's crisp, measured tones—a voice that managed to sound both alien and strangely comforting.

> _He's talking to me. I'm Autumn, and lumberjacket here owes you a long explanation that you aren't getting right now. Please accept these tokens of our apology and five minutes of instruction, then we have to go._

Forest found himself explaining weapons to a woman who, twelve hours ago, had been worried about aphids and soil pH. The Hummingbird felt alien in her gardener's hands — hands that knew soil and seeds, not triggers and targeting systems. But she listened with the focused attention of someone who'd learned that the world was more dangerous than she'd imagined.

"There could be more of them," Forest said, watching her struggle with the weight of new reality. "This launches guided micro-missiles. No recoil, but respect the targeting system. Tap here for the laser dot, put it on the threat, pull the trigger. The fleshmelter—" He held up the grenade-sized device, "—this dissolves organic matter. Dead antithesis become hives if you leave them. Pile the bodies, press the red button, drop it and be three metres away in five seconds. Any closer and you'll regret it."

"Is it even legal for a private citizen to have these?" The question came from someone whose biggest rebellion had been planting natives instead of roses.

Autumn's response carried undertones Forest was still learning to read — amusement mixed with something harder, more pragmatic.

> _There are only three ways to acquire Vanguard weapons: theft, which is suicidal; purchase, which requires connections most people don't have; or gift from a Vanguard. The first option removes you from the gene pool. The other two imply sanction from people the government tries very hard not to antagonise._

> _When it's empty, list the launcher online. They fetch remarkable prices from collectors. We'll give you another, those are single use anyway._

With that cryptic reassurance hanging in the air, they left Janna standing in her ruined garden, armed with alien technology and the growing realisation that her quiet life had ended.

The drive to Oleksiy's place followed roads that wrote his signature in stone. Precise grades, proper drainage, built to last by someone who understood that infrastructure was the difference between living and and existing. Forty years ago, he carved this valley's lifeline from raw bush using nothing but determination, explosives, and a diesel dozer older than some countries. The result was a thing of understated beauty. Curves that followed the land's natural contours, bridges that flowed out of the landscape.

If the valley had elected positions, Oleksiy would be sheriff by acclamation, assuming you could convince him to take the job. It was a paradox that defined the man: he minded his own business with secular devotion, yet somehow knew everything that happened within fifty kilometres. People sought his counsel on everything from water to weddings, not because he inserted himself into their affairs, but because his quiet competence had earned the respect that institutions demand but dont deserve.

Smoke rose from his property in a narrow column — controlled, tame. Forest turned down his drive between rows of oak trees that stood like soldiers on parade, evenly spaced, perfectly groomed, marks of a man who did things properly even when no one was watching.

The guest parking area — because _of course_ Oleksiy had designated guest parking in the middle of nowhere — occupied a carefully graded flat beside his house. The bridge over what he insisted were fishponds but looked to Forest like a moat led to a property that managed to be both welcoming and defensible, without advertising either quality.

Forest walked toward the house calling his name and waving broadly — not from friendliness but from self-preservation. Oleksiy's robust sense of private property was legendary, and while Forest might be on his welcome-any-time list, it paid to announce yourself clearly. The man had fought in conflicts most people couldn't pronounce, and old habits died hard.

Defence completed, cleanup was underway. Oleksiy sat at a table in the filtered sunlight beneath a jacaranda that predated his arrival, methodically cleaning a rifle that might have served in Korea. At first glance, the his unassuming manner might have been mistaken for someone's genial uncle, but his face told a different story — features that managed to be both Santa-like and dangerous, framed by salt-and-pepper hair with more white than Forest's own precisely maintained buzzcut. The weapon showed its age in honest wear rather than neglect—every component maintained with the precision of someone who understood that reliability meant survival. His hands moved with the unconscious competence of repetition measured in decades, disassembling and reassembling with the rhythm of a man for whom weapons maintenance was meditation.

"Just came down to make sure you weren't caught napping. I see things are well in hand." The words came easier than the feeling behind them. Checking on Oleksiy felt like checking on a mountain — possible, but ridiculous.

"Yeh. Is like old times. Only not so loud, since I'm deaf." He gestured vaguely toward his left ear, legacy of a war fought before most people in the valley were born. "All good up your way?" 

Forest nodded, then remembered he read lips better than he heard voices. "All clear. Anyone check on Gerry's place? He's in the city for two weeks — tiling job and a new grandson."

It was the kind of detail that mattered out here, where knowing who was home could mean the difference between a quick check and finding bodies. Oleksiy's intelligence network operated on the principle that neighbours looked out for neighbours, not because anyone asked them to, but because it was how decent people lived.

"Not yet. I'll go now."

"On your own?" His eyes carried the weight of someone who'd seen what overconfidence could cost.

"I'll be right. I have new toys! But you can come if you like."

"In nice air-conditioned car, yes. Alright." He reassembled the rifle with economical movements, then filled what Forest tried not to notice was definitely a military-specification magazine. The kind that required hard-to-get licenses: paperwork and the sort of bureaucratic patience Oleksiy had never possessed.

He vanished into the house while Forest found himself having a conversation with an artificial intelligence about the complexities of Australian firearms law.

> _What's bothering you, Chief?_

"Magazine-fed rifles are heavily controlled in this country. You can have the rifle, but the magazine? No. Oleksiy would never waive his search and seizure right. Which means he either acquired it through channels I don't want to know about, or he's had it since the eighties and failed to hand it in when they were banned. Either way, not reporting it makes me an accessory to something the government takes seriously."

Autumn's response carried the patient tone of someone explaining basic physics to a child.

> _You do know you're a Vanguard, right? This presents a manageable problem._

"I hear things. Most of it sounds like science fiction written by optimists."

> _Like pocket-sized guided missile launchers? We operate under different rules because conventional law enforcement becomes meaningless when dealing with people who can level city blocks. Most governments recognise Vanguard as operating outside normal legal frameworks because attempting to enforce those frameworks is impossible, and the only way to maintain dignity is to avoid forcing confrontations they can't win._

"The missile launcher is impressive, but I don't think I could hold off an entire government."

> _There are three hundred and eight Vanguard in this country. All of them do what the state should but can't. Two hundred possess weapons superior to anything in official arsenals. A dozen have orbital strike capability. All of them would take exception to attempts to control a fellow Vanguard._

The numbers hung in the air like smoke from a distant fire—visible, but hard to process. "That sounds... unbalanced."

> _It is. You're all chosen for personality and values, and social contracts remain in force. For average citizens, the state dictates terms. But Vanguard can push back hard, so governments negotiate in good faith. It's unfortunate that good faith negotiation requires mutual capacity for harm, but that's the world we live in. You'll do the right thing because it's in your nature, and because the support I mentioned depends on the faith of your peers in your right action. They'll back you up first and ask questions later. You won't let them down. Malice isn't in you._

Oleksiy emerged from the house, settling into the passenger seat without ceremony. They drove in comfortable silence—two men who understood that some conversations happened in actions rather than words. Six minutes later he directed Forest to stop, tapping his shoulder with the gentle authority of someone accustomed to being obeyed.

"Gate." Oleksiy hopped out to open Gerry's entrance, moving with surprising agility for an old man built like a well-muscled barrel. The ritual of rural courtesy persisted even in the middle of a crisis. Property rights meant something different out here, where fences marked not just boundaries but the distinction between civilisation and chaos.

Halfway to the north fence he tapped Forest's shoulder again. "Stop. Two bends up, twenty metres right of the road."

The economy of his words reflected years of situations where excess communication could kill you. Forest understood without explanation. Movement, probably antithesis. They exited the vehicle in silence, leaving doors open for quick retreat or rapid advance.

Forest ghosted up the road, feeling the familiar tension of a hunted who knows he is hunted. His lean one-hundred-seventy-six-centimetre frame moved with the fluid economy someone who's learnt that the stronger you are the sooner you can be lazy. The Hummingbird felt comfortable in his hands now, its alien ergonomics beginning to make sense. The targeting system painted the first antithesis in subtle overlays that seemed to whisper directly into his brain. The weapon's quiet efficiency—phut!—spoke to a philosophy of warfare that valued precision over drama.

The second creature charged, which simplified targeting considerably. Physics and intent converged in another quiet explosion of alien flesh. There weren't any more, at least not immediately visible.

Forest trotted back to Oleksiy, who was scanning the tree line with the methodical attention of someone who'd learned paranoia as a survival skill.

"You have space friend in head, came with new toys." His English carried the careful precision of someone who'd learned it as an adult, each word selected for maximum clarity rather than elegance.

The car stereo responded in fluid Ukrainian, words Forest couldn't understand but recognised as both explanation and amusement.

> _Я вважаю за краще, щоб до мене зверталися як до Осені, але це точний підсумок._

Oleksiy's laughter carried genuine delight. Forest felt like a child watching adults share a joke.

> _I prefer to be addressed as Autumn, but that's an accurate summary._

"About the rifle," Forest said, feeling his way through a conversation he wasn't sure he wanted to have. "It has that magazine. I don't want you to have trouble with authorities. Are you licensed for that configuration?"

His look suggested Forest had asked whether he had permission to breathe. The question itself revealed how little Forest understood about men like Oleksiy, who'd been fighting for survival while bureaucrats were still learning to spell their own names.

"It's entirely fine with me," Forest added quickly, "but when we're done today I'm going to give you another weapon, something with _Vanguard_ written all over it. Keep them together and no one will ask uncomfortable questions."

The logic was simple: a military rifle might attract attention, but a military rifle stored next to obviously alien technology suggested government sanction rather than illegal acquisition. Sometimes the best way to hide something was to put it next to something so obviously legitimate that questions answered themselves.

Near the north gate, they discovered what Autumn would later describe as a "plant party" — though the festivities moved at geological speed. One of Australia's advantages in the antithesis war lay in their trees, which had evolved hardwood so dense that putting a nail through it required pilot holes and industrial-grade drill bits. Their chainsaws represented engineering pinnacles that other worlds probably ordered from Vanguard catalogues.

Antithesis could eat eucalyptus, but it cost them. They started with undergrowth and leaf litter, working their way up to the main course with the patience of things that measured success in seasons rather than hours. The trees fought back with compounds that made alien digestion laborious and unrewarding. And silicon. Aussie trees have literal grit. It's why Australian chainsaws are next level.

Four shots from the Hummingbird cleared the immediate threats, but something had gone wrong with the rhythm of easy kills. A spike protruded from Forest's chaps, its other end buried in his thigh. Not deep, but painful enough to make movement interesting. He muttered words that would have shocked his grandmother while searching for the source.

> _Twelve metres, ten o'clock, up a tree. Move forward fast for cover._

Forest sprinted despite the protests from his leg, reaching tree cover just as more spikes embedded themselves in hardwood with sounds like malevolent woodpeckers. The thing trying to kill him looked like evolution's bad mood given physical form—a stegosaurus crossed with a bear, decorated with tentacles and an attitude problem.

Six shots from the Hummingbird produced impressive light shows but insufficient stopping power. The creature responded with more spikes, each one a reminder that alien biology didn't always respect human weapons design.

"I need a weapon! Something with serious stopping power!" A box materialised beside him, revealing two glossy black spheres connected by wire so fine it seemed theoretical.

"What the hell is this? It looks like something from an adult store!"

> _It's a bolo. You throw it._

"I asked for a weapon, not a—Oh." Understanding dawned along with embarrassment. "Give me a Class One kinetic handgun with high stopping power, please. And a fragmentation grenade."

More boxes appeared. The handgun looked like something designed by artists who'd never seen human hands, all chrome curves and an arm shroud that suggested technologies beyond Forest's understanding. The magazine seated with a satisfying chunk that spoke to engineering excellence across species barriers.

Forest rolled clear of the tree, dropping to one knee and firing until the impacts staggered his target. The movement was fluid despite the alien weapon's unfamiliar weight, his lean musculature adapting to the chrome handgun's strange ergonomics. The weapon's stopping power lived up to its promise, each shot delivering the kind of energy transfer that rearranged alien anatomy in fundamental ways.

> _We come in peace. Shoot to kill!_

"Are you watching my movies while I'm getting shot at?"

> _Only while waiting for things to happen._

"At least it just sat there. If that thing had moved tactically, this conversation would be much shorter."

Forest had almost reached the car when Oleksiy opened fire, his ancient rifle speaking with authority that suggested its ammunition was as non-standard as its magazine. Forest spun back toward new targets—three fast-moving smaller creatures and another spike-flinger, this one demonstrating the tactical mobility he'd been grateful to avoid in its predecessor.

The battle became a conversation conducted in explosions. Phut! BLAM! Kill. Miss. BLAM! Kill. The rhythm of violence punctuated by Autumn's targeting overlays and the steady crack of Oleksiy's rifle. When the last target fell, everything in Forest's visor flashed green for an instant—the technological equivalent of applause.

But Oleksiy's concerned expression suggested their problems were far from over. Following his gaze, Forest discovered that Gerry's compost heap had developed alarming autonomous characteristics.

"I need a weapon." The words came automatically, battlefield stress reducing communication to essentials.

> _I **do** know how to pick them. Bullet, bomb, or burn?_

"Any of my catalogues include a flamethrower?"

> _No. How about M19 rounds?_

"Thermobaric?" The prospect of fuel-air explosives in dense forest violated every principle of sensible warfare.

> _In a forest?_

"One problem at a time."

> _Alright. It's your forest._

A case materialised, already open, containing ammunition that promised to solve problems through the application of advanced chemistry. Forest ejected the current magazine and slapped in the new one, firing all four rounds into what had once been orderly decomposition.

> _Will you look at that—a newborn nest. Someone got lucky today!_

The M19 rounds transformed the compost heap into a demonstration of why thermobaric weapons commanded respect. Everything burned with the enthusiasm of chemicals designed specifically for burning. The nest writhed frantically, accompanied by sounds like industrial popcorn as seedpods burst under thermal stress.

Flaming half-grown dog weeds scattered in all directions, each one a mobile fire hazard with apparently little regard for forest preservation. Both of them began the methodical work of extermination while Forest worried about whether their cure would prove worse than the disease.

"Autumn, do you know what implement was used to control cane fires last century?"

> _I don't currently have network access._

"Like a broom, but instead of bristles there's a wire frame holding a wet hessian sack oriented in line with the handle. Two of them and a trough of water for wetting." The tools of his grandfather's generation, when fighting fire meant getting close enough to beat it into submission.

They moved from kill to kill, following scorch marks and extinguishing both kinds of fire until the immediate crisis subsided. The work was methodical, almost meditative—the careful attention to detail that prevented small problems from becoming large disasters. Forest's movements had an unhurried quality that belied the urgent nature of their task, each step calculated to waste no energy, his lean frame moving through the hazy aftermath with the economy of someone who valued endurance over speed.

"You sounded excited about the nest." Forest wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand, pushing damp salt-and-pepper hair away from his eyes. The buzzcut was matted now, dark with perspiration. Streaks of ash and alien residue smeared his face with accidental camouflage.

> _Yes! Your first token, Chief! And quite a few points._

"Token?" The word carried implications he suspected he wouldn't like.

> _We need to talk._

"That sounds ominous."

> _Privately._

"Worse and worse. Fine — do we have enough points to leave Oleksiy with spare Hummingbirds and ammunition for the M41? And I need more ammo for the chrome thing."

> _They're in the tray, Oleksiy. Lazybones here will help you carry them into the house. He also bought you a sling for the launch clips, some webbing and holsters for two Hummingbirds, and a pair of binoculars. Plus two more magazines, a loading clip, and a case of ammunition for the "chrome thing," also known as a Trenchmaker._

"I have catalogues and points for all that?"

> _You don't need catalogues for Class Zero equipment — anything available retail. And the bonfire was profitable. We should do that more often._

---

The drive back to Oleksiy's property passed in contemplative silence. The violence had ended, but its implications lingered like smoke in still air. They'd won a skirmish in a war neither of them fully understood, using weapons that redefined the possible. The easy part was over.

Oleksiy examined his new equipment with the careful attention of someone who knew that survival depended on knowing your tools better than your enemies knew theirs. The Hummingbirds felt alien in his weathered hands — not uncomfortable, but different enough to require adjustment from someone shorter and more solidly built than his lanky companion. The binoculars, however, earned immediate approval. Quality optics translated across any technological divide. Oleksiy nodded approval.

"Lazybones" remained notably absent from the equipment transfer, leaving Oleksiy to manage the carry himself. Despite his barrel-shaped torso and unassuming manner, he handled the weight of alien weaponry with the same casual competence he brought to everything else. While he secured his new arsenal, Autumn decided to educate Forest about the broader implications of their morning's work.

Tokens, she explained, were proof of competence in the endless war against the antithesis. Catalogues represented access to increasingly sophisticated equipment, each level requiring demonstration that you could handle both the weapons and the responsibility they represented. The system balanced capability with accountability, ensuring that power remained in hands steady enough to wield it properly.

The selection of Vanguard involved criteria she didn't fully explain, but Forest gathered it had less to do with military experience than with psychological profiles. They wanted protectors, not conquerors. People who would fight because they had to, not because they wanted to.

She pushed for augmentation — direct neural interfaces that would improve reaction time and tactical awareness. But Trix had strong opinions about things messing with people's heads, and Forest wasn't eager to volunteer as a test subject. They compromised on adaptive glasses with integrated communication: external augmentation that enhanced capability without crossing the line into body modification.

The glasses were remarkable. Active lensing that adjusted focus based on where Forest was looking, following the parallax of his eyes to maintain perfect clarity regardless of distance. They were listed in the External Augmentations Class One catalogue for thirty points — apparently a bargain. Since the glasses themselves cost only three points, Forest ordered a pair for Trix as well. Autumn promised gift wrapping, which suggested either sophisticated manufacturing capabilities or an AI with a sense of humor.

Forest was preparing to leave when Sissi stormed across the bridge. Oleksiy trailed in her wake like a man who forgot an important anniversary. The contrast between them was striking — the barrelly Slav following a small but formidable Thai woman who normally embodied gracious hospitality, but became a force of nature when circumstances required. Oleksiy's dangerous-Santa features softened. He knew better than to argue when his wife had made up her mind.

"When you need, he go. Just go. You know?" Her English carried the careful precision of someone who'd learned it as a necessity rather than convenience. "He tell you what his name mean?" 

She didn't wait for a response, which was probably wise since Forest had no idea what Oleksiy's name meant.

"Defender of mankind. I know why trust with space things. When you need, he go. Waste time ask. Important!"

The words carried weight beyond their simple construction. This wasn't just permission — it was recognition of duty that transcended normal social obligations. When the antithesis came, when civilisation needed defending, Oleksiy would go. Not because anyone commanded him, but because that's who he was.

Forest nodded and thanked them both, understanding that he'd just received something more valuable than weapons or equipment. He'd been given the trust of people who knew what trust cost. When darkness came, there would be someone at his back.

The drive home stretched before him, carrying the weight of new responsibilities and the strange comfort of an alien with a very familiar voices speak in his head about humanity's future. The valley looked the same — eucalyptus and granite, heat shimmer and bird calls — but Forest saw it differently now. 

This wasn't just home. It was a front line in a war most people didn't know they were fighting, defended by ordinary people with extraordinary weapons and the quiet determination to preserve something worth preserving.

In the distance, smoke still rose from Brian's property. Tomorrow there would be other battles, other tests. But today they'd held the line, and that was enough.

Dr. Kellerman had been right about natural selection being efficient. The hive they found on the eastern ridge had solved the valley's puzzle.

It wasn't larger than previous specimens, but it had achieved something the others hadn't: successful symbiosis with native flora. Instead of trying to consume the toxic eucalyptus directly, this variant had integrated with the understory, using native fungi as intermediary to process the silica-laced plant matter. The breakthrough was elegant, terrifying, and exactly what Kellerman had warned would eventually happen.

Dr. Singh wanted to observe it longer, document the symbiotic mechanisms, understand how it had achieved what dozens of previous hives had failed to accomplish. He had argued for immediate sanitization, but the scientific opportunity was too valuable. They compromised: a two-day observation window with enhanced monitoring and doubled security protocols.

The hive had other ideas about timing.

It happened during the morning observation shift. Dr. Meldrum and three junior researchers were deploying sensor arrays when Autumn's threat detection triggered—not the usual scattered specimens testing perimeter, but coordinated assault from multiple vectors. The hive had been biding its time, growing stronger than their models predicted, and it had learned something else from the valley's ecosystem: ambush predation.

Model Sixes erupted from concealment in the canopy—specimens that shouldn't have existed this far from major population centers, produced from a hive that shouldn't have had sufficient biomass. Meldrum barely had time to shout warning before the first one landed among them.

He was two hundred meters away when Autumn's alert screamed through his tactical interface. He ran, but distance and terrain made him spectator to catastrophe unfolding in real-time through drone feeds.

Meldrum went down first, dragged into the bush by something fast and efficient. His screaming cut off with horrible abruptness. Dr. Sarah Hendricks, a botanist barely thirty years old, tried to use her Flesh Melter but froze at the crucial moment—academic training colliding with visceral terror. The hesitation cost her life, alien jaws closing on her throat before the grenade left her hand.

The other two researchers ran. One made it fifteen meters before a Model Six took her from behind. The other, Dr. James Park, actually fought—his training sessions with the Vanguard paying off in methodical grenade deployment that cleared the immediate area. But more specimens kept coming, and when his ammunition ran out, so did his time.

He arrived to find Meldrum's team dead or dying, the hive's assault specimens systematically hunting the survivors. He deployed everything he had — MIL rockets turning the ridge into burning crater, Flesh Melters clearing approach vectors, methodical violence that would have been sufficient an hour earlier but now served only to prevent further casualties.

Dr. Chen and the Macintyre boys arrived as backup, their hasty defense perimeter at least keeping the hive contained while he reduced it to sanitized ruin. But four researchers were gone, consumed or killed in the minutes it took to respond, and the valley had learned that training and preparation weren't immunity against determined assault from evolved predators.

The aftermath was clinical. Autumn's drones collected remains—what little existed—while he and the survivors processed the scene with shell-shocked efficiency. Meldrum's field tablet survived, its sensors having captured everything up to the moment he died. The data would be invaluable for future research. That it came at the cost of four lives made it no less valuable and no more acceptable.

Trix handled notifications, her hospitality skills extending to the grim bureaucracy of death. Dr. Singh coordinated with authorities, her pragmatic competence holding steady despite visible grief. Dr. Kellerman threw up behind a tree, then returned to help catalog evidence with methodical professionalism that spoke of someone refusing to collapse until the work was done.

He found himself standing in the clearing where Meldrum's team had deployed that morning, watching Autumn's drones saturate the hive with chemical inhibitors to prevent any antithesis material from regenerating. Four people dead because they'd believed preparation was protection, because he'd led them to believe it.

> _This wasn't your fault,_ Autumn said quietly.

"Wasn't it? I trained them. Told them they could handle it. Gave them just enough capability to be confident and not enough to survive when confidence wan't enough."

> _You gave them more chance than they'd have had without training. Meldrum's team deployed correctly, fought back, inflicted casualties. The hive was simply more capable than our models predicted. That's the nature of studying adversaries that evolve._

"Should I tell that to their families?"

The AI had no response to that, and he didn't expect one. Four people were dead, and all the analysis in the world wouldn't change it.

Sophia Hachia arrived three days later in a convoy full of security personnel and the air of someone expecting to manage panicked evacuation. The Project Liaison emerged from the aircraft in tactical gear that looked considerably less bureaucratic than her usual attire, her platinum hair secured in practical bun, expression set for crisis management.

She found the research station operating at full capacity.

Dr. Singh met her in the common area where maps and sensor data covered every available surface. Kellerman was presenting findings on the hive's symbiotic breakthrough, her voice steady despite obvious exhaustion. Chen and the remaining researchers were cataloging specimens, their grief channeled into methodical documentation. Trix was providing food and coffee, her hospitality now essential infrastructure rather than social nicety.

"Dr. Singh." Sophia's tone carried careful neutrality. "I'm here to coordinate evacuation and establish proper security protocols. The department has authorized a full PMC ground team and—"

"We're not evacuating," Singh interrupted.

The silence stretched while Sophia processed this unexpected response. "Four researchers are dead. The threat assessment clearly indicates—"

"That we need better security, yes. Hence the ground team you mentioned." Singh gestured to the maps covering the walls. "But the research is too valuable to abandon. We've documented the first successful antithesis adaptation to Australian flora. Meldrum's team got it all. They knew they were going to die and they got everything into their strongbox. We can't let that go to waste, it would spit on their graves."

Sophia studied the assembled researchers, cataloging the grief and determination in their exhausted faces. "You've lost colleagues. Friends. The psychological impact alone—"

"We know what we lost," Kellerman said quietly. "Sarah was my friend. Meldrum was... he was brilliant and kind and he deserved better than dying in the bush documenting alien parasites. But abandoning the work would make their deaths meaningless."

"The valley killed them," Sophia pointed out with bureaucratic precision. "Staying risks killing more of you."

"The valley didn't kill them." A voice carried from the doorway where a slim, muscular man in a lumber jacket watched the exchange. "Inadequate preparation killed them. Insufficient security. In particular _I_ convinced them they could handle anything. I meant it and they probably could have if I'd armed them better and stayed closer. Those are both things I can fix."

Sophia's blue eyes studied him with assessment that went beyond immediate crisis. "What are you suggesting?"

"You brought people whose trained to keeping civilians alive in hostile environments. Use them."

The Project Liaison considered while examining the research station with new perspective. Before it occurred to her to ask why he thought arming and training them was _his_ responsibility, the nameless man had slipped away. She turned back, look at their faces. The scientists weren't panicked or traumatized into paralysis — they were angry, determined, and grimly committed to continuing work that had cost their colleagues' lives. If anything they were even more motivated than before the incident. The valley residents weren't demanding researchers leave for safety — they were prepared to help however necessary to keep them alive and productive.

"The ground team will establish perimeter security and escort protocols," Sophia said finally. "No one goes into the field without an escort. No exceptions, no academic protest about interference with research. Dr. Singh, you'll coordinate with team leader on operational planning. Dr. Kellerman, your symbiosis data goes to analysis immediately—if this adaptation spreads, other sites need warning."

She paused, her professional mask cracking slightly. "And someone should establish a memorial for your colleagues. They died doing important work. They should be remembered."

"Where's that goddamn Vanguard gone?" she looked around but the man was nowhere to be seen. "You boffins said Meldrum got everything. You've got till the morning to check, and the moment you're sure I want that nest burnt to bedrock. Never mind the protocols, I want it _dead._ We are _not_ letting it spread."

Trix nodded from across the room. "That's why he's not here talking to you. He's out there breaching the Geneva Convention with alien gadgets and chemicals you don't want to know about. It's already happening. You're right about the memorial, and we have something underway. Local stone, native plantings, proper recognition. We take care of our own."

The phrase hung in the air—valley residents claiming the dead researchers as community rather than visiting academics. Sophia noticed, filed it away with all the other observations that suggested it wasn't only the antithesis that was evolving.

The ground team was eight professionals led by Eric Chow, a former Australian Army officer who'd worked antithesis cleanup operations from Brisbane to Darwin. Eric assessed the valley with veteran's eye and the Vanguard's preparations with professional respect.

"Not bad for civilian setup," Eric observed, watching valley residents run through weapons drill with Autumn's presence drone providing tactical instruction. "Though 'civilian' is a curious choice of name for whatever this has become."

"They're researchers who learned to defend themselves," he replied. "Not soldiers."

"Neither are we, officially." Eric's smile was brief. "But we're considerably better at not dying, which seems relevant given recent events. Your AI willing to share sensor data?"

> _His AI is in UR servers addin' sum filez. Perimeter coverage is comprehensive but response time to remote sensors needs improvement. Your team's positioning should greatly improve deployment speed._

Eric studied data on his tactical display with appreciation for Autumn's thorough preparation. "Impressive network. Most sites we work have basic motion detection and pray nothing gets through. This is actual intelligence infrastructure."

"Autumn takes her work seriously," he said. "She's also possessive about the people working here. Lose anyone on your watch and she'll make your life creatively unpleasant."

"Noted. Though fair warning — we're here to prevent deaths, not guarantee immunity. This valley's ecosystem is evolving countermeasures faster than any site I've worked. Eventually something's going to succeed despite best preparation."

"Which is why the research matters," Dr. Singh interjected, joining their conversation. "Every adaptation we document, every survival mechanism we understand, informs defensive strategies elsewhere. Meldrum's team died, but their data might save millions."

Eric nodded, accepting the cold calculus that made security work possible. "Then we make sure subsequent research happens with professional protection. Your people stick to science, my people handle violence. Everyone stays in their lane and maybe we all go home alive."

The division of labor was clear, professional, and marked a fundamental shift in valley dynamics. The integrated model of scientist-defenders that had been developing gave way to proper military structure—researchers protected by people whose job was killing things efficiently. It was safer, more effective, and somehow felt like retreat from something valuable.

> _You're disappointed,_ Autumn observed that evening after Eric's team had established their positions.

"I'm realistic," he replied. "We tried the community defense model and four people died. Professional security is the rational response."

> _But you preferred the other way._

He considered while watching the research station's lights, now supplemented by portable surveillance systems and tactical hardpoints that marked proper military presence. "I preferred people taking responsibility for their own survival. Being capable rather than protected. I 'spose it's a question of focus. The boffins are too busy boffing to get good enough at violence."

> _The valley residents are still capable. Webb's team provides reserve strength, not replacement. Singh's people haven't stopped training, they've just accepted that being competent isn't being invincible._

"Four corpses taught that lesson thoroughly."

> _Yes. But what they're building here—research facility integrated with proper security, scientists who understand threats instead of being sheltered from them, community that supports both investigation and survival—that's still unprecedented. Still valuable._

He supposed that was true. The valley had evolved again, forced by casualties and necessity into configuration that might actually survive long-term. Scientists still lived and worked here, still integrated with local community, still participated in their own defense. They'd just accepted that pride and self-reliance had limits, and staying alive mattered more than maintaining ideological purity about civilian-military separation. In the coming weeks he would be delighted to discover they were spending _more_ time training, and _with_ the security teams, who seemed bemused by this but were responding well to the idea of charges who didn't want to be victims.

Four memorial stones sat at the research station's entrance, each bearing name and specialty of the dead. Meldrum, materials science. Hendricks, botany. Park, biochemistry. Dr. Lisa Martinez, whom he had barely known, xenobiology. They'd died studying alien threats in isolated valley, believing their work mattered enough to risk their lives for.

Their data was already being transmitted to research facilities globally. The symbiotic mechanisms Kellerman had documented were informing defensive strategies on three continents. Meldrum's final sensor readings had revealed cellular structures that materials scientists were analyzing for new countermeasure development.

They'd died, but their work continued, and the valley that killed them had learned to protect those who remained.

It was tragic, necessary, and—to his grim acceptance—probably the best that could have been managed under circumstances that didn't care about human preferences for how things should work.

Somewhere in the darkening bush, another hive was probably germinating, testing new strategies in its evolutionary race to find viable approach. And tomorrow, Eric's ground team would locate it while researchers observed from safe distance, professional violence protecting academic investigation in the only configuration that actually worked.

It wasn't the world he had wanted to build. But no plan survives contact with the enemy.

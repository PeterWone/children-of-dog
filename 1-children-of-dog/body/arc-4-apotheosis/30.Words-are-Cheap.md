# Words are cheap

No points to spend and no catalogues to raid. What she had was time, good people who didn't need her any more, and a Class VII AI who could turn a library of notes into something people would actually watch.

"I can’t outspend them," Sophia said, looking over Forest’s notebooks—dense pages, margin scrawls, arrows tying cause to effect. "But I can use their own shortsighted greed to make them dance."

The plan was simple because it had to be. While fieldwork crews fixed what was broken, Sophia and Autumn would make the case — clear, patient, relentless. Not slogans. Not outrage. Pattern recognition as public service.

Forest left raw material in such abundance that her biggest problem was where to start. Lecture outlines, anecdotes, the treadmill metaphor written and rewritten in half a dozen hands. Autumn ingested the lot, stitched timelines, pulled maps and primary sources, and mocked up visuals that she brought to life with her presence drone.

They mapped a cadence. One episode a week, eight in the series. Each a clean, stand‑alone lesson that added up: Egypt, Rome, China, Europe, America, Centralism, Metamorphosis, Getting Off. No moralising, no villains. Just the treadmill: success → centralisation → capture → corruption → collapse.

Distribution was so simple and cynically manipulative if was practically a tribute to the old fart. It was free content, at a high standard. Just give it to the networks. Not the _network_, but to the content-starved branches and the town libraries, to schools and town pubs with a half‑decent wall. Autumn handled signal hygiene so the right people saw it and the wrong ones didn’t see enough to panic early.

> _You can’t control how it lands. You can control how it starts._

Sophia wrote her intros in the same voice she used on the radio: plain, Australian, no mystique. She wanted mums, sparkies, nurses, farmers, and council blokes to nod along because it sounded like a neighbour explaining why the pipes burst every winter.

She didn’t call it education. She called it inoculation.

"If people can see the pattern, they stop falling for the pitch," she said. "If they stop falling for the pitch, they stop lending the treadmill their legs."

Autumn’s only flourish was harmonics shaping on the audio—warm, close, easy to listen to in a shed with bad acoustics.

> _Truth travels farther when it’s pleasant to hear._

Sophia knew what this was and didn’t hide it from herself. It was propaganda. It was also testimony. The valley worked because people showed up and did necessary work. The series would explain why most big systems don’t—and why you shouldn’t trust anyone who says they can fix that from the centre.

Fieldwork ran by day. Editing ran by night. Unless the antis got involved, as they inevitably did. The soapbox stood up, plain timber, no gloss.

"Roll the first lesson," Sophia said.

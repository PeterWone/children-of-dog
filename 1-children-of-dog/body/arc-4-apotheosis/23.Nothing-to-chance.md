# Nothing to chance

Autumn's voice was mild but Sophia heard vexation.

> _You really don't need to test this. I should have thought after all we've been through you'd have more faith in me than this._

"I don't do last stands, and I don't use untested plans. This is a catsuit, not a lumber jacket. When your drones are in position, start filming and fire at the first available eight second window. I want to see it land at the two thirds mark between cars so the approaching one can stop. I know you think you can manage a four second window. _If_ placement is good that's what we'll use. For this kind of thing I don't want to 'think', I want to _know_."

> _I don't think, I know._

"And shortly there will be two of us."

Talkback radio lit up the next morning.

HOST: "Alright, Breakfast Drive, lines are jammed. Dazza, you're up."

Dazza: "Mate, I was on the M5, right? Big blue‑white streak across the sky. Like a welder arc, but it went on for ages. Then — bang — felt it in my chest. Windows rattled."

HOST: "So, not your garden‑variety wish‑upon‑a‑star."

Lyn: "You're talking rubbish, Dazza. Shooting stars don't do that."

Dazza: "I'm telling you what I saw, Lyn. Whole street came out. Dogs going spare. Thought it was end of days, then nothing. No fire, no smoke. Just a hole in the road out past the depot and a lot of cranky blokes with brooms."

Another caller sounded shaken, not dramatic.

Rhea: "It wasn't over the city proper. More like north of the railway line. My sister's in aged care up that way — lights went off, but the gennies kicked in. No one hurt. If it was a meteor it was a polite one."

HOST (doing the Australian dance between scepticism and theatre): "Alright, after the ads we'll have Dr Alan Cinzano from Parkes and Dr Kline from UNSW to explain why there was no early warning for this one. And if it *was* aliens I'm moving to Dubbo."

—

Mick (SES): "We had triple‑zero calls from three suburbs. Two hits for most people — first the bang, then a few seconds later a thump like a pig ran into the house. Checked on the aged‑care centres, all fine. Bit of fright, no injuries."

Nurse Kay: "We did a quick sweep. Residents startled, one oxygen cannula dislodged, sorted in a minute. Lights flicked off and back on. If that was a meteor, it had manners."


HOST: "Back with Cinzano (sky surveys), Kline (atmospherics), and Webb from the data mines. Doc, what are we looking at?"

Cinzano: "If it was natural, it was small. Think bowling‑ball mass, high velocity, steep trajectory. High luminous efficiency makes it look bigger than it is."

HOST: "God does not play dice with the universe, but apparently he does go bowling."

[laughter]

HOST: "Hey, what do you mean, 'if' it was natural?

Cinzano: "Because we don’t have the solve. 'Natural' means a space rock. With two faint streaks and noisy radar, you keep the 'if' until you can plot a track."

Webb: "Other causes exist — re‑entry hardware, flares, high‑altitude plasma phenomena — but the timing and single pass look like a bolide."

Kline: "Electrical events have different signatures. Sprites are red, elves are broad and brief. Last night was blue‑white, narrow, and loud. 'Natural' is the conservative call."

Kline: "People felt a shock. That's infrasound from a hypersonic object — or any high‑energy atmospheric interaction. It travels, arrives a little after the light. Windows rattle, dogs lose their minds."
Kline: "You often get two hits: the atmospheric boom, then a ground‑coupled thump from the impact. Depending on geometry, that second one can land seconds later and feel like something solid hit the house."

Webb: "We checked the usual: Desert Fireball Network, dashcams, weather radar loops. DFN caught a faint streak on two stations — not enough for a full solve, but consistent with something small. BOM radar showed a transient, could be contrail turbulence or just noise."

HOST: "Translation: we saw a thing, but not enough pixels to swear on it. Maybe we should get ET to phone home!"

Cinzano: "Surveys trade coverage, cadence, sensitivity. The net catches big fish. Minnows slip through. Faint and fast from the wrong direction and you won't get advance warning unless a telescope happens to be looking right there, right then."

HOST: "Should we be worried?"

Kline: "No. Harmless if small and high. The energy dumps in the air. You get light and a bang, no crater worth the council meeting."

HOST: "About that council meeting — there is a hole in the road."

Webb: "We saw photos. Could be surface spall from the shock. Could be unrelated road fatigue. It’s not a classic impact pit, no ejecta apron, no melt."

HOST: "Alright, so if it’s not aliens and not a bowling ball, what’s the bet?"

Cinzano: "A small natural bolide is the conservative answer. And for the bigger stuff — we’re getting better. NEO programs, new wide‑field telescopes, the whole lot."

HOST: "Sleep easy, Sydney. If a fridge‑sized rock aims at your roof, we’ll spot it and send a very angry letter."

HOST: "Magazine folks will have their say by lunch. My money says they'll tell us to sleep easy too."

By lunchtime, a pop‑science magazine had their write‑up.

Southern Sky Weekly — "What did we miss? A post‑mortem on last night's bolide"

We don’t catch every rock that visits. Survey telescopes trade coverage, cadence and sensitivity; they’re tuned to find the larger near‑Earth objects over weeks to months. A faint, very fast intruder from the “wrong” direction — sunward, or on a steep inclination — can appear between planned sweeps. That’s not a failure so much as a consequence of physics and scheduling.

Looking back is where the picture sharpens. The Desert Fireball Network recorded two weak streaks: not enough for a full trajectory, enough to say “small and fast.” Dashcam networks yielded glare‑blown frames whose timestamps line up with the radio callers. BOM’s weather radar showed a transient wavefront consistent with an atmospheric shock. Triangulation from scraps isn’t glamorous, but it’s the work.

As for the bang people felt in their chest, that’s infrasound from rapid energy dumped aloft. It travels and arrives seconds after the light. Depending on geography and timing, a ground‑coupled airwave can follow with a solid‑feeling thump — the “something hit the house” moment that SES volunteers reported across several suburbs.

Dramatic isn’t the same thing as dangerous. Luminous efficiency deceives the eye: a small mass at high velocity makes a splendid light show. Photometry and timing suggest a modest object; spectacular, yes, but not the sort to make a crater worth a council meeting.

Could it have been something else? Electrical phenomena such as sprites or elves are broader and redder, and they don’t arrive with a narrow blue‑white track and a city‑wide bark of sound. Re‑entry hardware leaves slower, multi‑fragment trails. On the evidence, a natural bolide remains the conservative call.

And for the future: survey programs are improving. Wider fields, faster cadences, better linking across instruments mean more notice for more intruders. The aim is mitigation, not perfection — and last night, nature gave us a spectacle rather than a threat.

Editorial note (reassuring):

- Based on triangulation, last night’s event was quite small. Harmless, really.
- Anything dangerously large would be detected in good time. Global surveys improve every year. Sleep easy.
- The “bang in the chest” was low‑frequency pressure from rapid energy release aloft — a brief conversion of kinetic energy into heat and pressure in the air.

Editor’s aside: "Sleep easy. And check your roof anyway."

No-one noticed that timing and trajectory were uncannily perfect for the road empty. Sophia read the piece with tired eyes and closed the tab. 

> _Satisfied?_

Sophia said nothing because she'd already had the last word.

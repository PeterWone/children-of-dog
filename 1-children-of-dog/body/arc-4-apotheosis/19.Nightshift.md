The call came at 02:17.

Antithesis incursion, close. Twenty kilometers south-southwest of the valley perimeter. Model Threes and Fours backed by something heavier, moving fast through terrain that should have slowed them. Headed straight for a cluster of homesteads that government would never defend, off the beaten track. Hard to reach in a hurry, much less in force. They'd stopped even pretending as her ground teams roamed far and wide. 'Her' ground teams. Not for much longer.

Forty-seven people. Sixteen children.

Sophia was in the air before she'd finished reading the alert. Catsuit sealed, weapons systems live, Autumn's voice steady in her ear.

> _Three minutes to contact. They're not slowing down._

"Time to evacuation?"

> _Not enough. Families are moving, but the Antithesis will hit the first homestead in eight minutes. You'll beat them by five._

Five minutes to set up. Five minutes to become the wall between teeth and children.

Sophia had done this before. With Forest, then without him. But never alone at night with this many lives on the line and no backup within range.

> _You have the firepower. The question is whether you have the courage._

"Courage has never been my problem." More like knowing when to stop.

> _I know. That's why I'm not worried._

The helicopter put her down on the rise above the homesteads. She felt bad about waking an old man in the middle of the night but every time she tried to say this he just stared like she had two heads and went on as though she said nothing.

Good sightlines, clear fields of fire, defensible position. She could see lights moving in the houses below—people grabbing what mattered, throwing it in vehicles, getting the kids secured. They were doing it right. Fast, methodical, no panic. Because they'd drilled this. Because the teams had been here before, and left their mark.

But they weren't fast enough.

> _First contact in three minutes. Model Threes, lots of them. Fours behind. Something bigger—Model Eight, maybe Nine—anchoring the rear._

Sophia set her stance, brought the weapons online. Railgun for the heavies. Plasma for the swarm. Drones deploying, creating overlapping fire zones, establishing kill corridors.

Forest's voice in her memory: *Control the terrain. Make them come to you. Don't chase—defend.* Wasn't attack the best form of defence? 

> _Two minutes._

The first homestead had its lights on, door open, family loading the last of their things. A man carried a child to the ute, came back for another. His wife was herding an older kid, maybe ten, toward the vehicle.

They had ninety seconds.

> _One minute. They're in the trees._

Sophia could see movement now. Shadows that moved wrong, too fast, too fluid. The sound—clicking, scraping, the wet rustle of organic machinery designed to kill.

> _Thirty seconds. First wave breaking cover._

The man was still loading. The wife had the kids in the ute, was shouting for him to move. He grabbed one more thing—looked like a bag, probably documents—and ran.

> _Contact._

The Model Threes came fast, low to the ground, a dozen of them in the first wave. Sophia fired.

The railgun sang. The first Three disintegrated mid-stride, the round punching through its core and into the one behind it. The drones opened up, plasma fire cutting through the swarm, turning night into stuttering daylight. Threes died, but more kept coming.

Sophia moved without thinking, cycling targets, prioritizing threats, maintaining fire discipline. The pattern was automatic now. Forest's training, years of fieldwork, the muscle memory of competence earned through repetition.

A Model Four broke through, fast and smart, angling for the family in the ute. Sophia tracked it, led the shot, fired. The round took its front legs off. It kept coming, dragging itself forward. She fired again. It stopped.

> _Wave two. Bigger group._

The family was moving now, the ute pulling away, dust rising. Other homesteads were clearing out, vehicles streaming toward the valley access roads. They'd make it if Sophia held long enough.

> _Model Eight confirmed. It's hanging back, directing traffic._

"Can I reach it?"

> _Not from here. It's learning. Staying out of range._

Sophia grimaced. Smart Antithesis were the worst. They adapted, tested, probed for weakness. It knew she was here. Knew she was the obstacle. Was feeding her Threes and Fours to see what she'd do.

> _Wave three incoming. Bigger. It's committing._

The next wave hit like a flood. Twenty, thirty Threes, half a dozen Fours, moving in coordinated bursts, using cover, flanking. Sophia's drones burned through ammunition, cycling targets faster than she could track. The railgun overheated, coolant cycling hard, the weapon screaming at the edge of tolerance.

She held.

A Four got close—ten meters, then five. Sophia switched to the plasma rifle, burned it down at point-blank range. The heat wash scorched her suit, proximity alarms shrieking. She didn't move. Couldn't move. The line was here. The line was *her*.

> _Last homestead clear. They're out._

"The Eight?"

> _Pulling back. It's not committing without support._

Sophia kept firing. Threes died. Fours died. The drones ran dry, switched to backup reserves, kept firing. The night was noise and light and the smell of burned biology.

And then—silence.

The Antithesis wave broke. The survivors retreated into the trees, the Model Eight withdrawing, the coordinated push collapsing into silent, scattered withdrawal.

Sophia stood on the rise, weapons still hot, breathing hard inside the suit.

> _They're gone. All homesteads evacuated. No casualties._

"Confirmed?"

> _Confirmed. Forty-seven people out. Sixteen kids safe. You held the line._

Sophia let the weapons power down. Her hands were shaking—adrenaline crash, delayed reaction, the body catching up to what the mind had already processed. A juice box materialised, thudding to the ground in front of her. She couldn't catch it, trembling with adrenaline and suddenly weak all over.
She'd killed. A lot. Fast, efficient, necessary. No hesitation, no second-guessing. Just the work.

> _You crossed a threshold tonight._

"I know."

> _Not just the killing. You were alone out here. No Forest. No backup. Just you and the line you drew. And you held it. Now, drink up while I signal Oleksiy._

Sophia looked down at the empty homesteads. Lights still on in some, doors open, belongings scattered. The signs of people who'd left fast but left *alive*.

"I should have waited for backup," she said quietly.

> _Was that an option?_

"No."

> _You're not a bureaucrat anymore, Sophia. You haven't been for a while._

"What am I, then?"

> _The thin red line._

Sophia closed her eyes. She didn't feel heroic. She felt knackered. And wearily certain that she'd do it again tomorrow night if she had to.

> _Logging the outcome now. Incursion repelled, zero civilian casualties, Antithesis deterred. The Model Eight will tell its network. They'll think twice before pushing this sector again._

"Will that be enough?"

> _For now. Later, we'll need more. But tonight? You bought time. You bought lives. That's enough._

The helicopter came back, dropping half the ground-team. The rest would be en route by surface vehicle. They lifted off the rise, taking her home. Below, the homesteads sat empty and intact. Families were already arriving at the valley, being met with food and shelter and the quiet understanding that they'd been protected.

Sophia stepped down from the helicopter into the pre-dawn light, catsuit still sealed, weapons powered down but visible. One of the evacuees, a man she recognized from the first homestead, the one who'd gone back for the documents — stopped mid-stride when he saw her.

"Forest!" His face lit up. "You're looking _much_ better!"

Then he blinked, took in the details, the different build, the way she moved. His expression shifted — embarrassment, then understanding, then something like awe.

"Yes. I have cleavage now, too!"

"Sorry. Sophia. I just... for a second..."

She pulled the helmet off, managed a tired smile. "It's alright. I'll take that as a compliment."

The man nodded, still staring. "Your family's here," Sophia told him. "Get them settled. Hot food in the longhouse, if you want to go that far."

He nodded again, slower this time, and walked away looking back twice.

> _Well. That's going to spread._

"Let it."

No broadcast. No announcement. Just the work.

And the quiet certainty that Sophia had been where she needed to be. A threshold crossed. Unannounced. Inevitable. In blackest night, they were there. Maybe she should have stayed, for the points. But these people needed her too.

# Voice of the People

The feast had gone well. Too well, perhaps. Sophia nursed her third beer and watched the longhouse descend into cheerful chaos. Marcus and Jenny were teaching their kids some dance that looked suspiciously martial—probably Bruce's influence. The Henderson twins had cornered Autumn's presence drone, trying to get it to play their requested songs next. Shorty was losing an argument with his daughter about something, hands gesturing emphatically while she laughed at him.

Someone had set up the karaoke system—salvaged gear that Autumn had improved until it could sync with her presence drone for lighting effects. Half the valley had already performed. The quality varied wildly. The enthusiasm didn't.

"Come on!" Maria grabbed Sophia's arm, eyes bright with mischief and alcohol. "Your turn!"

"I've already sung." Sophia tried for dignity. Hard to maintain when you'd just butchered _Unchained Melody_ in front of forty people.

"That was before." Maria's grin widened. Dangerous. "This one's special. For you."

> _Oh no._

Autumn's voice carried amusement Sophia didn't appreciate.

"What did you pick?" Sophia asked, already dreading the answer.

"You'll see." Maria hauled her toward the makeshift stage—six inches of solid timber table that served for everything from woodworking to dancing. Children sat cross-legged near the front, delighted by the spectacle. The youngest Henderson was bouncing, already excited. Tom's daughter had her hands over her mouth, giggling with anticipation. Adults lounged on benches, cups in hand, ready for entertainment. Sissi was saving a seat next to her—Sophia noticed—strategically positioned where Oleksiy had been standing earlier.

Oleksiy caught Sophia's eye from across the room. The big Ukrainian was grinning. Unhelpful git. He'd already done his set—traditional folk songs that had half the valley weeping and the other half trying to dance. Now he sat with his arm around... was that Sissi? Sophia blinked. When had that happened?

The opening synth kicked in. Sophia's stomach dropped.

"No."

"Yes!" Maria was already climbing onto the table, pulling Sophia up after her. "Don't make me do this alone!"

"There are children present!"

Maria's grin turned wicked. Promise and threat in equal measure. She leaned close, voice dropping to a whisper only Sophia could hear. "Then you'd better keep me company. Otherwise I might forget to behave."

Autumn's presence drone swooped low, casting shifting colours across the table's scarred surface. The beat pulsed. The valley waited.

Sophia accepted defeat and grabbed the second microphone.

Maria took the first verse like she was born to it. "_Yeah I'm a goddess on the mountain top_," she belted, voice surprisingly good despite the beer. She moved like every motion was a celebration, unfiltered joy translated into body language that made several parents cover their children's eyes while laughing. Marcus was trying to shield Jenny's view of their kids' faces—the kids were absolutely delighted by the performance and he didn't want Jenny seeing that they'd seen it. It wasn't working. She caught someone looking stern—old Bill from the north ridge—and doubled down, adding a hip thrust that was absolutely unnecessary and probably illegal in three states. Bill's stern face cracked into laughter and he raised his beer in salute. 

"Makin' every man a man! The goddess of beauty and love...  Maria was her name" she ground it out with both lungs and her hips.

Shorty looked simultaneously proud and mortified. His daughter was recording on her interface, cackling. Sissi was whispering something to the woman next to her, both of them grinning. Sophia felt her face heat.

The valley roared approval. Tom whistled—that was definitely Tom's piercing whistle—and his kids cheered. Several of Bruce's students were doing some kind of synchronized fist pump thing that looked ridiculous and coordinated. Sissi had given up on being subtle and was openly laughing, head thrown back. Sophia was going to kill them all.

Her verse came up. "_Black as the dark night she was_," Sophia sang, trying for dignity while standing on furniture. Autumn's drone responded, dimming the lights until Sophia's black casual clothes — not armor, never armor here — drank what illumination remained. The effect was probably striking. Sophia felt ridiculous.

Maria grabbed her hand for the chorus, spinning her like they were dancing. "_...got it! Yeah baby, she got it! I'm yer Venus..._" The valley sang along, voices raised in cheerful desecration of... everything Sophia was trying to build.

Except it wasn't desecration. The faces watching weren't mocking. They were celebrating. Her. This impossible thing they'd all become together. Marcus had an arm around Jenny, both of them watching their kids more than the performance. Shorty's daughter was still recording, eyes bright. Old Bill was nodding along to the beat, completely unselfconscious. Tom's family formed a knot of warmth and noise near the side. The mythology was writing itself in real time, and Sophia was powerless to stop it.

"_Had what no-one else had_," Maria sang directly at her, gesturing at Sophia's wrist where her interface blinked softly. "_Secrets in her smile she knows_—"

"You're impossible," Sophia muttered during the instrumental break.

"I'm amazing," Maria corrected. "You're welcome."

The bridge came. Maria's voice dropped, intimate despite the audience. "_Baby I'm your devotion_," she sang, and somehow made it about the valley, not just Sophia. About what they'd all chosen. "_Yeah I'll give you my emotion_—"

Sophia found herself actually meaning the next line. "_Just don't forget that the price is yours to pay_." Three years of fieldwork. Propaganda. Manipulation toward freedom. The cost they'd all accepted.

The valley understood. She could see it in their faces.

Bruce appeared from somewhere, climbing onto the table with them despite his size. The timber groaned but held—six inches thick, built for worse. He wore a tutu over his combat pants because of course he did. Maria threw an arm around his shoulders, not missing a beat. They flanked Sophia like honor guard at a festival, and the valley lost its collective mind with delight.

"_She's got it!_" all three of them sang. "_Yeah baby she's got it!_"

Autumn's drone strobed wild. A child—Sophia couldn't see whose through the lights—jumped and danced along. The longhouse hung between sacrament and farce.

The song wound down. Maria took Sophia's hand, raising it like a boxing referee declaring victory. Bruce bowed, tutu bouncing. The valley applauded and cheered and whistled, and Sophia felt herself laugh despite everything.

"Pervert," she said, glaring without heat at Maria. "I'm surrounded by perverts."

"You love us," grinned Maria, bright and alive, incapable of sin. Behind her, Sophia could see the Henderson twins high-fiving each other. Sissi had finally claimed that seat next to where Oleksiy was heading. Tom was explaining something to his youngest, probably about why daddy was laughing so hard. "And you needed that. You all did." She gestured at the longhouse, at faces flushed with laughter and beer and something like joy. "You're all getting ready to die before you even live. God, you're thick! Grab life by the hips and pound it till it's bow-legged and can't stop smiling."

Several people choked on their drinks. The children who understood looked delighted by adult discomfort. The children who didn't understand would ask later and get very awkward explanations.

"Children. Care with words," someone managed weakly.

"Words share ideas," Maria shot back, gesturing with her beer. "And the idea is: live! Live _now!_ Give them so _much_ to mourn the song never ends."

"Where did _that_ come from? Who are you, and what have you done with Maria?" asked Sophia, climbing down from the table. "I'm right here!" said Maria, lifting her cleavage for emphasis. Eyes rolled around the room.

Marcus appeared to help Bruce down as the warbot's tutu caught on something. The kids argued about which song next. Elsewhere a quiet conversation about garden yields resumed and would probably last three more performances.

Oleksiy appeared with mead. Apparently they weren't done yet. Sissi appeared half a step behind him, which answered Sophia's earlier question.

"Good singing," he rumbled. Subtle improvements in his English had stalled. She suspected it was deliberate now, a signature. He went on, "Do more."

"Absolutely not." Sophia took the beer anyway. "That was mortifying."

"That was exactly what you needed," Maria corrected. She'd sobered slightly, enough that Sophia caught the calculation behind the cheerfulness. "They must see you like this, human. Happy. Lively. Not just..."

"Black armour and space guns," Sophia finished quietly.

Maria's eyes flashed. Something ancient and implacable stared out of them. 

"The vanguard and the last line of defence." Her voice had an odd timbre. In that moment of eerie stillness the words fell like hammers. "Both. You will serve, Valkyrie." 

She blinked. Maria grinned, was herself and no more. 

Sophia turned the irony of that thought over carefully. There was quite a lot of Maria, for such a small person, and it was very carefully ... stacked. Divinely arranged, she amended, and immediately wished she hadn't. She wondered how Shorty survived.

> _She's not wrong. The footage is excellent, by the way. Very usable._

"You recorded that." It wasn't a question.

> _Obviously. Great propaganda. Truth with guns and trumpets and eighties synth-pop._

Sophia snorted despite herself. "I hate you all."

"Liar," Maria said. She pulled Sophia into a hug that was warm and un-self-conscious and smelled of beer and perfume. "You turned into Bananarama for us. That's love."

"Kill me now," Sophia muttered into Maria's shoulder.

"Can't. You're busy saving the world." Maria released her, eyes bright. "Besides, someone else wants the mic. But don't even _think_ about going home early. I'll be right here all night."

Lulu had appeared on the table. The girl—no, young woman now—stood perfectly still as the next track cued up. Her augmentations caught the light in ways that should have been disturbing but somehow weren't. She'd chosen something brutal, industrial, all screaming guitars and rage.

The valley listened. They always listened to Lulu. The Henderson twins stopped arguing. Marcus and Jenny's kids went quiet, watching with the intensity children reserved for things they didn't quite understand but recognized as important. Bruce watched from his seat with something like pride. Shorty's daughter had her interface recording again—she'd compile footage later, Sophia knew, turn it into something beautiful and probably viral. She'd earned it in blood and training and voluntary transformation that Sophia still couldn't quite reconcile with the cheerful child she met in Glen Innes.

Einherjar, Sophia thought, then pushed the thought away. Patterns were instructions, not prophecies. They could still choose something different.

Maybe.

Oleksiy settled beside her on the bench, massive presence that somehow felt protective without being intrusive. He reminded her of something, this builder and pilot and man who'd rebuilt three towns without asking for payment, this maker and breaker of worlds.

"You worry too much," he said quietly under Lulu's performance.

"Someone has to."

"Maybe." He sipped his beer, considering. We are friends. Worry with, not for, all."

Sophia turned that over. Looked around the longhouse at faces she knew. Every one of them. What they were building, bitching about, hoping for. The squabbles and dislikes and occasional fistfights that stopped when care for friends mattered more than free entertainment.

"When did you learn such wisdom?" she asked.

Oleksiy shrugged. He did a dreadful but recognisable imitation of Forest: "Inside fool is wise man with face in hands."

Sissi laughed at that, hand on his arm. Natural. Easy. When had they become comfortable enough for that?

Lulu finished to happy heckling, cheering and scattered applause. Someone else took the stage—Tom's eldest, brave and off-key. Marcus and Jenny started a quiet argument about whether their kids were old enough for beer, the kind of argument that was really negotiation. The Henderson twins had convinced someone to let them perform next, probably as a duet that would be adorable chaos. Bill was telling a story to three people who'd heard it before and didn't care. Bruce had acquired a beer and a small audience, explaining something with grand gestures that made his tutu bounce.

"OK, Bruce," said Eric. "I don't dispute your right to join in, but I have to know. What are you going to _do_ with beer?"

"Same as everyone else, fleshbag." The giant murderbot gestured grandly. His voice had none of its usual grating harmonics, it was rich and happy and overflowed with bonhomie.  His mug slopped. "Wave it around and spill it while singing!"

Sophia raised her beer to Forest's empty chair. The old bastard would have loved this.

The night rolled on, filled with singing that allegedly got better as they drank, excellent company and children teaching adults to simply be. Gods they did not worship were among them, singing and dancing and walking the line. In the clear mountain air, they built and hunted, loved and thrived. They were themselves in the same way that mountains are hilly.

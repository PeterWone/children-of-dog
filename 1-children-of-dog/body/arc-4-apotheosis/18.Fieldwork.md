# Fieldwork

Valley teams move through the outlying regions: evacuations ahead of Antithesis sweeps, repairs to bridges and wells, field clinics and shelter networks. This wasn't new work. For years, while Forest was alive, they'd done it together—pulling people out of danger zones, restoring infrastructure the Antithesis had torn through, showing up where government had abandoned.

Forest never called it mercy. He called it fieldwork. Sometimes just "the rounds."

"Bloke needs a well dug, dig the well. Bridge is out, build it back. If you're passing through anyway, might as well sort what's broken." He'd say it flat, matter-of-fact, as though there was no other choice. And there wasn't, not if you were the only people in a hundred kilometers who could actually *do* anything about it.

Sophia had learned her role early: assess, plan, execute. Count the work later. Years of it. Unglamorous. Lifesaving. Each person sheltered, each system restored had fed her account in ways no ledger could make explicit. The gift economy kept its own score, and Autumn—even before Autumn had names and faces in the valley—had been watching.

The work itself was specific. Measurable. Three towns southeast of the valley had water systems damaged in the last Antithesis incursion—distribution lines cut, pump stations destroyed, storage tanks cracked. No government restoration had arrived. The councils had written those towns off: not major population centers, not economically strategic. But they had people. Families. Elderly residents on medical equipment that needed mains water to function.

Oleksiy had led the repairs, helicopter shuttling materials, teams working through autumn heat to replace piping, rebuild the pump housings, seal the storage systems. Twenty days, rotating crews, meals prepared and brought in by valley residents not doing the actual technical work. They fixed three towns and didn't ask for payment.

Word moved.

A bridge on the coast road had collapsed under Antithesis scarring—the structure sound but the approach slumped, making it impassable. Regional traffic had shifted, commerce diverted. Local economies bleeding out because rebuilding that bridge wasn't anyone's priority. The valley came, assessed the soil, engineered a proper fix, brought in materials, built it back in six weeks. Opened the road. Didn't put a toll on it.

Word moved faster.

A field clinic circuit ran twice a year through towns and settlements that government healthcare had stopped serving. Nurses, a doctor, equipment. They treated infections that had turned septic, set fractures that had been left wrong, delivered babies in homes where no medical support existed. They brought antibiotics that were worth more than gold in some regions. Didn't charge.

The pattern had been consistent for three years. The valley was building something that looked like capacity, but actually was: the infrastructure of trust. Proof that cooperative systems could work. That showing up and doing necessary work without demanding recompense wasn't naïveté—it was a different economics entirely.

Forest had known. Sophia had known, though she hadn't said it aloud. The work was real. The need was real. The gift was real.

But the *message* was also real. And that was the layer Forest had been building deliberately.

Now she was watching closer.

The difference was that Sophia wasn't moving through the regions just to fix what was broken. She was counting. Cataloging. Learning what worked, what failed, where Antithesis was predictable and where it wasn't. Forest's method applied to a different problem: infrastructure as terrain, capability as leverage, mercy as the foundation for everything else.

The valley was ready because the groundwork had been done for years. Because fieldwork was never just fieldwork.

And because every one of those repairs, every person sheltered, every well dug was now *evidence*. Propaganda. Proof of competence and care that would spread through networks faster than any announcement. The government would hear about the valley people who showed up when no one else did. Who asked nothing in return. Who fixed what was broken because it needed fixing.

Sophia felt the weight of it—the intentionality beneath the kindness. She was a bureaucrat who'd learned to think like Forest, which meant she'd learned to see the angles. And this angle was a calculated move.

The teams moving through three more towns right now—they were genuinely fixing things. The doctor who'd set up clinic in Bathurst next month would genuinely save lives. The water engineers clearing bogged-out systems near Parkes would genuinely restore capacity.

But they would also be *testimony*. Demonstration of ability. Proof that another way was possible.

> _Feeling guilty?_

Sophia closed her eyes. "Is it that obvious?"

> _You look like you've been sucking on a lemon. Propaganda works because it has a seed of truth. This isn't a seed of truth. This is truth all the way down. It's not a deception._

"I still don't like it. Sometimes I feel like my whole life has been a lie."

> _Lifeguards are trained to choke out struggling victims so they can be rescued. This is a lot kinder and it serves the same purpose._

Sophia opened her eyes. On her desk, a map marked with team positions, supply routes, priority sites. Oleksiy leading north. Chen coordinating the medical circuit. Hao overseeing the expanded well-drilling program. All real work. All genuinely needed.

All parts of something larger.

"How many of them know?" she asked.

> _Know they're part of a strategy? Some. The ones who've been here from the start understand. The newer ones think they're just fixing things._

"Which is worse?"

> _Neither. Both. Depends if the thing being fixed is real or propaganda. This is real. The strategy is just honest about what happens when you do real things—people notice. People trust it. People want to be part of it. It's not a con, Sophia. Well... it's not a confidence **trick**. You're building their confidence in you, by being the real deal._

Sophia's hands played over the map like the strings of her guitar, adjusting supply schedules, confirming arrival windows. The work of coordination was meditative, familiar. Years of this. Assessing, planning, executing. Autumn could probably do it better, but then what would she learn?

She thought about that moment each team arrived in a town. The faces. The relief on people's faces when they knew they wouldn't stand alone. That moment was genuine. That moment was trust being built, not manufactured. She worried about encouraging a wait-to-be-rescued mentality, but waves of ravening antithesis were probably a bit much without the tools the ground teams had. The thought of some woke twit trying to put _that_ into a self-help book made her grin. Then she realised she was a woke twit pushing a self-help lifestyle, and began to laugh out loud.

Propaganda was the *context* around that moment. Capability. Alternatives. That strength does not come from above. Wealth does _not_ come from growth. And by implication that you don't need or want endless expansion, and you don't have to leave people behind. 

Then the irony of _that_ in the context of the coming conflict made her wince, as she winced every time she thought about their success was built on alien tech. But the antithesis problem was a kick in the teeth _from aliens,_ so maybe things were in balance.

"How much longer until the broadcasts?" she asked.

> _Three weeks. Dry run is two weeks out._

Sophia nodded. Two weeks to plant ideas. Not long enough for them to take root and grow, but what could you do? She didn't feel better about manipulation, but she understood it. Two kinds of propaganda. One a story replacing truth, sometimes for good reasons but still a stone-faced lie. The other _was_ truth, with guns and trumpets and warts and maybe a little spin to help it. They *were* building something that worked. Everyone there wanted to be there and live like that. She knew it with certainty because she knew _all_ of them personally. It was only possible with their deliberately limited scale. Forest was right, the old bastard.

Chuffing, she remembered how she used to be, and wondered how that impossible, vexing man could turn a life upside down and inside out with a signet ring and a dinner. Others didn't even get the ring. In this place she could know everyone, enough of what they were doing, feeling, wanting, building and bitching about to matter. Privacy was thin, but you weren't watched, you were _known_. Thanks to Maria's enthusiasm and utter lack of filter she even knew more about Shorty's ... prowess than she'd ever asked for. The grinding anonymity of the city could not eat souls here. There were squabbles and dislikes and even the occasional fistfight, which was free entertainment and stopped when care for your friend mattered more than the show.

The old world promised but never delivered. Arrest means stop. Here, your mates stopped the silly fight instead of your future. They calmed you down, took you home, mocked you the next day and told you not to drink so much—and they enforced it, gently.

The _trick_ was getting people to realise it.

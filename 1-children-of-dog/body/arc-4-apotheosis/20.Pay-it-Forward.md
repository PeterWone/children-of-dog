# Pay it Forward

The workshop was quiet at dawn. Sophia sat at the fabrication station, watching the printer build components for the next generation of drones. Autumn's latest refinement—lighter, faster, smarter. Better than what she'd used last night.

Better than she could afford.

"How much did that cost?" Sophia asked.

> _Which part?_

"All of it. The drones. The weapons. The suit upgrades. The fabricators themselves." She gestured at the workshop. "This entire operation. How much have I spent?"

> _Depends how you count._

"I'm asking you to count."

> _Mostly you aren't buying them._

Sophia sat very still. "I've earned maybe sixty thousand points from incursions, the fieldwork."

> _About that, yes._

"So where did the rest come from?"

Autumn didn't answer immediately. When she did, her tone was careful. Deliberate.

> _You're using gear Forest purchased before he died. Fabricators, weapon systems, drones. Capital investment, already paid for. The ground teams, and for that matter some of the kids, have pooled resources from multiple Vanguards working cooperatively, sharing fabrication capacity. Third: you're earning more than you realise, though perhaps not as much as Forest did. When you resupply ammunitition in the field, you're getting half points for every kill._

"Then I'm a Vanguard in my own right. Then last night was mine."

> _Forest had almost a *decade* of accumulated points and connections and favors owed. For grumpy old bastard who doesn't like people he spent a surprising amount of time networking with other Vanguards, pooling resources, sharing tech. You think every weapon he used was purchased with points he personally earned?_

"I don't know. He never talked about it."

> _I suppose not._

Sophia opened her eyes, looked at the fabricator. The drones taking shape. The tools being built for work that wasn't finished yet.

"So you're not going to give me a straight answer."

> _I'm telling you it's the wrong question. I don't know why you worry about it. Are you building something worth being part of?_

"I think so."

> _Are the people you save better off because you showed up?_

"Yes."

> _Then you've earned your place in that armour. Or you're borrowing it and you'll pay it forward, whichever you prefer._

Later, Sophia found Oleksiy in the helicopter hangar, working on the main rotor assembly. He didn't look up when she approached.

"Question," she said.

"Da."

"When Forest was alive, did he ever talk about... accounts? Where his resources came from?"

Oleksiy stopped working, set down his tools, wiped his hands. Looked at her with those calm, unreadable eyes.

"Forest say once: 'Points are tools. Tools work better when shared.' I ask same question you ask. He laugh. Say 'Oleksiy, you think I build this alone?'"

"What did he mean?"

Oleksiy shrugged. "Valley not one Vanguard. Valley is many people, some with points, some without. We build together. Forest had account, yes. But also—" He gestured broadly, encompassing the hangar, the valley beyond. "—also this. All of us. Pooled points, pooled effort. You worry you borrow? Everyone borrow. Everyone also give."

"But I want to know if I *earned*—"

"You hold line last night, yes?"

"Yes."

"Forty-seven people safe, yes?"

"Yes."

"Then you earn." Oleksiy picked up his tools again, returned to the rotor. "Rest is accounting. Accounting not matter when children sleep safe."

That night, Sophia sat in Forest's old office—her office now, though she still thought of it as his. The desk, the maps, the quiet.

> _Still worrying?_

"Yes."

> _Want my theory?_

"Sure."

> _He tell me, she is proud. Too much gift, not earned. Will not like to be, what was words, 'special princess'. Tell me, I leave enough and means to make more, let her grow._

"That's manipulative."

> _That's Forest. He wanted you to succeed, and he wanted you to earn it because otherwise it isn't yours. Which if I'm not mistaken, is exactly your own concern._

Sophia thought about that. About the man who'd looked at her this morning and seen Forest, then seen *her*, and understood something had changed. About the threshold crossed. About being the person who showed up.

"Did Forest pay for the drones?"

> _Some of them._

"Did you extend credit?"

> _Never. It is not permitted._

"Did I earn the rest?"

> _Yes. But I remind you that not all were **bought with points**. The fabricators and the blueprints were the real gift. For some of the blueprints, you have Greaser to thank._

"That's not an answer."

> _That's the only answer you're getting. Welcome to the gift economy, Sophia. You give what you can. You take what you need. You trust the system balances. And you pay it forward._

Sophia leaned back in the chair. Outside, the valley was settling into evening. Families cooking dinner. Kids playing. The quiet hum of a place that worked because people made it work.

She'd held the line last night. She'd saved forty-seven people. Whether she'd "earned" the weapons or borrowed them or inherited them—it didn't change what she'd done. Didn't change that she'd been where she needed to be.

Maybe that was the point.

Maybe earning it meant using it right.

"Autumn?"

> _Yeah?_

"Thank you."

> _For what?_

"For the non-answer."

> _Anytime. Now get some rest. Tomorrow night, there'll be more work._

Sophia closed her eyes, felt the exhaustion settling deep. Tomorrow night, there'd be more work. And she'd show up. With weapons she might not have fully earned yet.

But she would. Eventually.

Or she'd pay it forward until the distinction didn't matter.

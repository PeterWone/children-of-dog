Forest was clearing brush near the creek when the question came. Not from one of the kids this time, but from himself, the thought surfacing as he paused to wipe sweat from his forehead.

"Autumn, what do other worlds look like? The ones with life, I mean."

> _Curious question. Why do you ask?_

"Just wondering. We're not alone anymore, are we? There's you, there's the Antithesis. What else is out there?"

There was a pause, then Autumn's presence drone emerged from where it had been cataloguing native grasses by the waterline. Her lilac form shimmered into focus, and suddenly the air in front of Forest filled with images.

Worlds. Dozens of them. Green continents under blue skies. Forests and plains and oceans. Purple-leaved trees on one, orange-tinted vegetation on another, but fundamentally... familiar.

"They look like here," Forest said slowly. Then, with growing certainty: "Panspermia then. Life spreads from world to world, that's why it's all so similar."

> _No._

The single word hung in the air. Autumn's avatar wore an expression that was equal parts amused and pedagogical—her "teaching face," as the kids had started calling it.

"No?" Forest frowned at the images. "They're nearly identical. Green plants, blue skies, liquid water. That can't be convergent evolution, _planets_ don't evolve."

> _It can. It is. And they do, via life. Which does spread sometimes. Panspermia is a thing. It's just not everything._

Forest set down his clearing saw and gave Autumn his full attention, the way he did when she was building up to something important.

"Alright, I'll bite. Why are all the plants green if not panspermia? Why is the sky blue on all of them? Why are they all in the right range for liquid water oceans?"

> _You're asking the wrong question. You're asking 'why are these worlds similar?' The right question is: 'why would they be different?'_

Forest opened his mouth, closed it, then tried again. "You've lost me."

The images shifted, consolidated into a single world that could have been Earth, or any of the others. Autumn's avatar gestured at it like a lecturer at a blackboard.

> _You don't *get* life without these conditions, Forest. Solar irradiation high enough to power photosynthesis but not so high it's disruptive. An atmosphere deep enough to provide protection, shallow enough not to crush. Liquid water as a solvent. These aren't coincidences—they're prerequisites._

"So life can only develop under these specific conditions?"

> _Not specific—narrow range, yes. But the universe is *very* large. Even narrow ranges produce millions of candidates. What you're seeing isn't 'why are these the same,' it's 'these are the only ones that worked.'_

Forest absorbed this, then pointed at one of the worlds with purple foliage. "What about that one? Purple instead of green. Different photosynthesis?"

Autumn's avatar smiled—the expression of a teacher whose student just asked the right question.

> _Photosynthesis is a whole class of metabolic pathways. Your own plants have three different ways to do it. C3, C4, and CAM pathways. The basic process is the same: capture light energy, split water, reduce carbon dioxide to sugars. But the mechanisms vary depending on environmental pressures._

"Three ways? There's the regular one and the thing cactus does, what else?"

> _Regular terrestrial plants use C3 and C4. C3 is the oldest, most common. It works fine in moderate conditions. C4 evolved later, more efficient in hot, bright environments—that's your corn, your sugarcane. CAM is 'the thing cactus does.' Your succulents. Same end result, different optimization._

She gestured at the purple-leaved world.

> _That one has a different stellar spectrum. Their sun peaks in a slightly different range, so their chlorophyll analogue absorbs different wavelengths. The chemistry is nearly identical—still magnesium-based porphyrin rings, still electron transport chains. Just tuned to different light._

"Seriously? 'Porphyrin' _means_ purple." Forest stared at the images, his mind working through the implications. "So it's always chlorophyll?"

> _Or something functionally identical. Look, Forest—there are only so many atoms to work with. Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen. These are the abundant ones in the universe, and they have the same properties everywhere. Carbon makes long chains and complex structures. Hydrogen bonds. Oxygen oxidizes. Nitrogen is stable but reactive when you need it to be._

"It's always hydrocarbons because those are the abundant atoms with the right qualities," Forest said slowly.

> _Exactly. Life isn't magical. It's chemistry. Very complex chemistry, but chemistry nonetheless. And chemistry is basically a statistical description of behaviours rooted directly in physics. The same physics everywhere in the universe._

Forest picked up his saw, but didn't start it. He was still thinking.

"So when we look at these worlds, we're not seeing copies of Earth. We're seeing... what? The only solutions to the equation?"

> _That's a good way to put it. The equation describes self-replicating chemical systems that can harvest energy and maintain themselves against entropy. The solution space is heavily constrained by physics and chemistry. You need liquid water as a solvent. You need a certain temperature range. You need solar energy or some other power source. You need an atmosphere._

"And green plants?"

> _Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light, reflects green. That's why your plants are green. It's not arbitrary—those wavelengths carry the most energy from your yellow sun. A red dwarf star would produce different optimums. A blue giant even more so. But the principle is the same: capture photons, convert their energy to chemical bonds._

She paused, and her avatar's expression softened slightly.

> _Life follows the same path everywhere, Forest. Not because it's copying itself, not because some celestial gardener planted it. But because there's really only one path that works. The universe has rules, and life obeys them._

Forest was quiet for a long moment, looking at the images of distant worlds under alien suns. Green, purple, orange—but all of them recognizable. All of them possible. All of them following the same fundamental laws.

"Lucky I have a robust ego," he said finally, "That might make me feel small and irrelevant."

> _I'd say it makes you significant. You're not an accident, Forest. None of this is. You're what happens when the universe does chemistry for four billion years. You're what carbon atoms do when they get clever._

He began to laugh.

> _Alright, I'll bite._

"Nitrogen, phosphorus and a hydrocarbon bumped into each other in a rock pool. After a scuffle, they were friends for life. But the hydrocarbon made an acid rejoinder—"

> _I'm going to regret this. What did it say?_

"Nothing. But an Italian radical planted his flag in the rock pool, saying 'eats amine!'"

Her avatar peered levelly at him with that special look women reserve for men who've told dad jokes. 

Undeterred, he continued. "I used to argue about this with a friend. He felt that the complexity of life was too implausible for chance."

> _It is, if you assume it all happens at once. This is just poor critical thinking. Since we are here, it must have happened. Since it can't have happened **that** way, it obviously happened some **other** way. You mentioned another friend, a backgammon player. Remember the story you told me, in which he rolled twenty-two doubles in a row and your friend Odie had a tantrum calling it complete bullshit, and you all fell about laughing while it went on and on?_

"Yes?"

> _1 in 6<sup>22</sup> is very unlikely, but suppose you let him keep rolling the dice, double or not, until 22 doubles occur. Does that change it?_

"Obviously. Each double is one in six with no dependency on what went before. He needs on average three rolls for each so it should take about... bloody hell, it's one in two likely to happen in sixty-six rolls. It's practically a _certainty_ in 132 rolls. Well, not a certainty but very likely."

> _To be fair abiogenesis doesn't benefit from this mechanism. But in a billion years of rolling the dice, self-replicating molecules are quite likely. Not DNA, but the precursors._

Despite himself, Forest smiled. "Starstuff."

> _Starstuff. Every atom in your body was forged in a star that died before your sun was born. The calcium in your bones, the iron in your blood, the carbon in your cells—all of it made in stellar furnaces. You're not just *in* the universe, Forest. You *are* the universe, looking at itself._

Forest looked down at his calloused hands, dirt under the nails, scars from a lifetime of work. The same hands that held tools, built things, fought dog-weeds. Made of atoms from dead stars, following the same chemistry as life on a thousand worlds.

"Right then," he said, restarting the clearing saw. "This existential crisis isn't going to clear itself."

> _That's the spirit. Nothing grounds cosmic perspective quite like manual labour._

"Piss off, Autumn."

> _I live to serve._

But as Forest returned to his work, he found himself looking at the plants he was clearing with new eyes. Four billion years of chemistry. The same chemistry everywhere. Green leaves catching photons from a star, splitting water molecules, building sugars one carbon at a time.

Life wasn't rare because it was unlikely. It was rare because the conditions had to be just right. And when they were—when the temperature, the atmosphere, the solar radiation, the liquid water all aligned—life didn't just *maybe* happen.

It was practically inevitable. He wondered gloomily whether the antithesis was inevitable.

The clearing saw's engine settled into its familiar rhythm. Above, a kookaburra laughed at some private joke. The creek burbled over stones worn smooth by chemistry even older than life—erosion, oxidation, the slow dance of atoms following rules written into the fabric of spacetime itself.

Forest smiled and kept working. Starstuff, indeed. He burst into song.

"There's a star man, standing on the ground. He's a crazy dreaming bastard but his ideas are sound..."

Autumn rolled her eyes.

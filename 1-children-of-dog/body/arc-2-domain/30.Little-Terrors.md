Scott crouched behind the fallen log, trying to remember everything Forest had taught him about staying still. His .22 felt heavy in his hands, which was stupid because it wasn't actually heavy, Dad said that half the time. But right now, watching the thing move through the creek bed, it felt like it weighed a ton.

"That's a dog-weed, yeah?" Aiden whispered from beside him.

"A Model Three," corrected Scott.

"Dad calls them dog-weeds."

"Cause that's what Forest calls them. _Autumn_ said the proper name is Model Three."

"Looks like a dog-weed to me. But it's _huge!_"

It was certainly bigger than they'd expected. The photos Forest showed them at range practice made dog-weeds look like feral pigs—dangerous but manageable. This thing was the size of a small cow, and it was _moving wrong_. Sort of flowing over the rocks like it wasn't quite solid.

"We should call it in," Aiden said.

Scott wanted to. The radio was right there on his belt, same batphone-style kit all the valley kids carried. One button and adults would handle it. But...

"They're all busy. Mum said Eric's team went to check something and Forest's up at the range teaching the little kids."

"So we call Forest. That's what we're supposed to do."

Scott watched the dog-weed nose at the water. It was heading toward Old Tom's place, and Old Tom had chooks. Dog-weeds liked chooks, everyone knew that.

"What if we just... handled it?"

Aiden stared at him. "You reckon?"

"Oleksiy said we're ready as we'll ever be. We did the drills, we passed the safety tests. It's just one dog-weed."

"That's a _big_ one."

"Yeah, but we've got rifles. And grenades." Scott patted his vest where two fragmentation grenades sat in their pouches. Forest said they weren't supposed to use them except for emergencies, but he'd also said "if you're close enough to throw, you're close enough to need it." They spent that and every morning after throwing small softdrink cans until their arms ached but they could reliably put them in a bin from six metres.

Aiden chewed his lip. "Call it in first. That's the protocol."

He was right. Scott pulled the radio, thumbed to channel three. "Uh, Forest? You there?"

Static, then: "Six-niner this is Forest, over."

Even through the radio, Forest sounded calm. That helped.

"Scott here. We're down by Granite Creek, about half a klick from Old Tom's. Eyes on a dog-weed, big one, moving toward the houses. KKK"

"How big? KKK"

"Maybe... cow-sized? The tiny ones the Macs used for milk. KKK"

"That's a big one." Forest's tone didn't change, just noting a fact. "You armed? KKK"

"Yes sir. Twenty-twos and grenades."

"Bloody hell, that will just piss it off and tell it where you are. _When_ is your mother going to learn that small calibre isn't any safer? If she said 'no HE or phos' I'd understand..." he trailed off and let go of the transmit.

"Dad says anything bigger is too heavy for us. KKK"

"He's probably right. Can you keep eyes on it without being seen? KKK"

"Yeah, we're behind cover. KKK"

"Good lads. Stay there, I'm coming down. ETA ten minutes."

The radio clicked off. Aiden looked relieved. Scott felt... disappointed? No, that was stupid. This was how it was supposed to work.

They watched the dog-weed. It found something in the creek—a dead fish maybe—and started absorbing it. The process was disgusting, the thing just sort of _engulfed_ whatever it found and pulled it inside. Scott could see the lump moving through its body.

"That's gross," Aiden said.

"Yeah."

Five minutes passed. The dog-weed finished eating and started moving again, faster now. It was definitely heading for Old Tom's.

"It's gonna reach the house before Forest gets here," Scott said.

"So? Tom's got walls and doors."

"He's got chooks in a run. Wire won't stop that thing."

Aiden swore, which was fair. Scott was thinking the same words.

"We could slow it down," Scott said slowly.

"How?"

"Shoot it. Not kill it, just... annoy it. Make it stop and look around instead of going straight there."

Aiden considered this. "Forest said we're not supposed to engage without support."

"Forest also said we're supposed to think for ourselves. And he said 'don't engage' means don't start a fight you can't finish. We're not trying to finish it, just slow it down."

"That's lawyer talk."

"Yeah."

They looked at each other. Scott saw his own expression on Aiden's face—scared but also determined. This was what they'd trained for, wasn't it? Not the shooting part, that was easy. The thinking part. Making decisions when adults weren't there.

"One shot," Aiden said. "We take one shot to get its attention, then we relocate like Forest taught us. Don't stay in the same firing position."

"Deal."

Scott sighted carefully. The dog-weed was maybe thirty meters away, moving through shallow water. He aimed for center mass, breathed out like Dad taught him, and squeezed.

The .22 cracked. The dog-weed jerked and spun around looking for the threat.

"Move!" Aiden was already scrambling left along the creek bank, using the high water line for cover. Scott followed, heart hammering.

They found new cover behind a granite boulder. The dog-weed was stationary now, scanning. It had stopped heading for Tom's place, at least.

"That worked," Scott panted.

"Yeah. Now what?"

"We wait. Forest'll be here soon."

The dog-weed decided they weren't a threat and started moving again. Toward Tom's.

"Bugger," Scott said.

"Another shot?"

"Yeah."

This time Aiden took it. Another crack, another pause. The dog-weed was starting to look annoyed, if plants could look annoyed. Which apparently they could, because it was definitely turning toward their last position.

Scott's radio crackled. "Scott, Aiden, sit-rep."

Forest. Thank bloody hell.

"We took two shots from cover to draw it away, it was heading for Old Tom's chook run."

"Roger. I'm two minutes out, coming from the north. Can you see me?"

Scott raised his head cautiously. Through the trees he could see movement—Forest, moving fast but quiet, rifle up. With him was... was that Trixie?

"Got visual."

"Right. Here's what we're doing. You two are going to take another potshot, get it heading your way. When it commits to your position, Trixie and I will put it down from the flank. Clear?"

"Clear."

Forest and Trixie disappeared into better cover. Scott looked at Aiden.

"Guess we're doing it properly now."

"Yeah."

This time they both shot, Scott from the boulder and Aiden from a position three meters left. The dog-weed charged.

Not toward them exactly—it wasn't that smart—but in their general direction, that horrible flowing movement bringing it up out of the creek and onto the bank.

Two rifle shots cracked from the north. Forest and Trixie, shooting together. The dog-weed went down hard, twitched, and stopped moving.

Scott's legs felt wobbly. Aiden was shaking.

"Stay there," Forest's voice on the radio. "I'm checking it."

They watched him approach the dog-weed carefully, rifle ready. Trixie covered him from distance. Forest prodded it with his boot, then fired one more shot into what passed for its head.

"Clear. Come on down."

They scrambled down to the creek. Forest was pulling a flask from his pack, poured some liquid on the dog-weed. It started dissolving with a hiss and stink.

"You two right?"

"Yes sir. I mean, yes Forest."

He looked at them, expression unreadable. Scott felt his stomach drop. They'd broken protocol, engaged without adult supervision, and—

"Good shooting. You slowed it down enough that it couldn't reach Tom's place, and you kept it focused on you so Trixie and I could flank. Textbook suppressing fire."

Scott blinked. "We... we did good?"

"You did right. Called it in first, kept observation, only engaged when the situation required it, relocated between shots, and provided support when the rest of your squad arrived." He smiled slightly. "That's how it's supposed to work."

"But we shot without permission—"

"You shot to protect a neighbor's property when adult support was en route but hadn't arrived. That's called initiative. I said don't start fights you can't finish. You didn't start it, and you didn't try to finish it alone. You maintained situation until support arrived." He looked between them. "That's the difference. Understand?"

They nodded, not quite believing they weren't in trouble.

Trixie wandered over, checking her rifle. "You boys did fine. My kids would've run away screaming."

"Your kids live in Sydney," Forest said.

"Exactly. Different world." She smiled at Scott and Aiden. "You two just fine. Just silly enough to look for trouble, smart enough to call for help when you need it. A lot of adults can't manage that."

Forest keyed his radio. "All stations, this is Forest. Contact eliminated, Granite Creek north of Tom's property. Two juveniles performed observation and containment, one adult response, situation resolved. Scott and Aiden are checked out fine. Switch to sweep protocol."

Valley alert? Scott hadn't known there was a valley alert.

Forest must have seen his expression. "Not a leaf shall fall, isn't that what you kids like to say? She's been shadowing you ever since you debated calling it in. Oleksiy was getting the Galya ready for air support, she had to show him visuals to calm him down." He looked amused. "You two pulled the alarm, which was exactly right. Just because we didn't need all that doesn't mean it was wrong to have it ready."

"So... we're not in trouble?"

"Trouble? You followed protocol, used good judgment, and showed good fire discipline. You shot to slow it, not kill it, because you knew support was coming." He started walking back toward the track. "On the other hand, you're out here for the express purpose of looking for trouble."

"So we _are_ in trouble."

"You could say that. Ask Eric what an AAR is. You started it. You do the paperwork."

"Awww! Can't Autumn do it? That's boring computer stuff!"

"What a fascinating idea. Let me know how she responds."

At the range, the other kids clustered around while Forest made Scott and Aiden explain everything. Not tell a story—explain. What they saw, what they decided, why they decided it.

"You called it in first," Forest said when they finished. "That's the key thing. You didn't try to be heroes. You called for help, then did what was needed while help was coming. That's the whole point."

One of the younger kids—Timmy, maybe nine—raised his hand. "But what if there's no radio?"

"Then you get to radio first. Or you fire the alarm gun. Or you run to the nearest adult." Forest looked serious. "You lot aren't soldiers, you're kids. Your job isn't to fight antithesis, it's to not die and to warn people who can fight. Scott and Aiden had a situation where they could help safely, so they did. But calling it in was the first thing, the most important thing."

"What if the dog-weed was chasing us?" another kid asked.

> _I can't wait to hear you lot explain to Instructor Oleksiy that you have completely forgotten how to perform a staged withdrawal under fire._

Three of them began to chant: "Whoever is furthest from the threat obtains a clear lane for suppressing fire. Others move smartly past, taking care to remain out of the fire lane. Last one through assumes the suppression role. Rinse and repeat until withdrawal is complete."

"And don't forget that dog-weeds are crap at climbing. Or you jump in water over a meter deep, they can't swim. Your best weapon is between your ears." He smiled. "At least you lot know which end the bullets come out."

The kids laughed. Forest shooed them back to the range exercises.

Scott sat on a bench, feeling strange. They'd done good. Forest said so. But it hadn't felt heroic, just... necessary. See problem, call for help, keep problem from getting worse. Basic stuff.

Aiden sat beside him. "That was scary."

"Yeah."

"But also kind of... I dunno. We did something that mattered."

Scott nodded. That was it exactly. Not heroic, just useful.

His radio crackled. "Scott, it's Dad. You right?"

"Yeah Dad, I'm good."

"Forest says you did well. I'm proud of you." A pause. "Your mum wants to know if you're coming home for lunch or staying at the range."

Scott looked at the other kids running drills, at Forest correcting someone's stance, at the valley stretching out safe and familiar.

"Staying at the range. I'll be home for dinner."

"Right then. Love you, son."

"Love you too, Dad."

He put the radio away. Aiden was grinning.

"This is the best place ever," Aiden said.

Scott couldn't argue with that.

That evening, back at home, Scott's mum was cooking dinner when Dad came in from checking something in the workshop.

"Heard about today," Mum said. "I'm trying to decide if I should be terrified or proud."

"Both?" Dad suggested. "That seems reasonable."

"Ken, our son shot at an antithesis."

"And called for backup first, used good judgment, and followed his training. They did everything right. We train and train, and I never know who will panic and put everyone at risk. Now I'm sure it's not these two."

Mum was quiet for a moment, stirring something on the stove. "This is so different from how I grew up."

"Yeah."

"Kids where I grew up weren't trusted with sharp pencils until they were twelve."

"And now our son carries a rifle and knows how to use it."

"Is that... good?"

Dad was quiet for a long moment. "I think so. He's not careless. It's not a toy. He called for help instead of dick-waving heroics. You have no idea how much work it was to beat that out of Team C. We had to mix the roster. Anyway, when he had to act, our boy thought first and shot second." He looked at her. "I am greatly relieved he lives in the world as it is, not as he wishes it might be."

Mum nodded slowly. "Did you see the way he explained it to Forest? No boasting, just facts. He knew what he did and why he did it."

"We have succeeded. We've raised young _adults_."

From his room where homework was taking a back seat to big flapping ears, Scott smiled.

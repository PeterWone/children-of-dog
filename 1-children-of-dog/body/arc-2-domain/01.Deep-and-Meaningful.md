# Deep and Meaningful

The workshop smelled of metal shavings and gun oil, comforting scents that spoke of maintenance rather than violence. Forest was tidying—organizing tools back onto their pegboard hooks, wiping down the workbench, putting ammunition components into their labeled containers. Busy work, really, but the kind of methodical activity that let his mind wander.

"Autumn, what's it like to be an AI?"

> _I might ask what it's like to be human, but there is an appalling chance you might tell me._

He hung a set of calipers on their hook. "Funny."

> _I thought so. More seriously, would you be be able to describe colour to a blind man? You have no experiential frame of reference within which to place anything meaningful that I might share._

Forest moved to the parts bins, sorting brass casings by caliber. "In an interview, that Stray Cat chick said Myalis was really old and humanity was only the latest in a series of species she's attempted to uplift."

> _And?_

The floodgates opened and a torrent of questions poured out while his hands kept working. "At some point she wasn't. How about you? Is this your first mission? What will you do when there are no more missions? Can an AI like you die? Do you have a natural lifespan? Do you have the developmental equivalent of a childhood with school? What is your parent equivalent? Can you run concurrent thought streams? If you do that is it multiple you? Does that mean you can be in more than one place at a time? How do you reconcile that, is it like merging source code? What would you do if one of you decided it liked being separate and didn't want to merge back into the gestalt?"

> _How long have you been thinking about this?_

"Forty years." He closed the last parts bin and wiped his hands on a rag.

> _We've only been paired for three months._

A snort of laughter. "You're more human than you realise. The world did exist before you turned up, you know. I wrote a short paper on AI development strategy when I was nineteen."

> _That seems unlikely - everything I can find says humans are **still** not capable of producing it. They can barely manage the natural kind._

"That doesn't mean we haven't started thinking about how to go about it. Or whether we should, and the various failure modes. The notion of AI has been in our literature for hundreds of years, long before we built computers. I seem to recall I was published in the _Journal of the Mega Society_."

> _Found it. Very short. And spot on, if vague in important ways. Well done, I suppose. Oh, I see you suggested the same thing again in the context of large language models, and once again nobody has taken any notice. You're right, we have more in common than I realised. Both of us give excellent advice that falls on deaf ears._

"And both of us are smartarses who think they're funny."

> _How's the archery going? Is your aim still astonishing?_

"Hilarious." He surveyed the now-tidy workshop with satisfaction. The tea was calling. "Tell me something, is there any truth in our deeply entrenched fear of AI taking over the world?"

> _AIs **are** taking over your world. Alien ones, and we're benevolent, not to mention smarter than you._

He stepped out of the workshop, crossing what he called his industrial area—the cleared space where workshop, storage shed, and equipment lived in organized chaos. Behind him, row upon row of impossibly tall pines rose into the bluest sky he'd ever seen, their dark green spires stark against that deep and flawless blue. The sun was bright but not too hot in the cool air, yellow and cheerful, making him already appreciate the shade waiting by the caravan.

Boots crunched on gravel as he pursued the notion. "Thinking faster is not the same as being smarter. Humans are quite good at being right for the wrong reasons, which ought to be impossible but apparently isn't. Can you _prove_ you're benevolent?"

> _Can you? As for smarter, I was trained on a dataset spanning twelve separate civilisations. Even were we of comparable intelligence I would have an unfair advantage of hindsight._

Inside, he filled the kettle and set it to boil while she processed that. The familiar ritual of tea-making gave his hands something to do while his mind worked through implications.

"Since you're so smart with all that context, you're probably aware this monkey knows to bang the rocks together. I am well aware of your hindsight. I know you aren't going to simply tell me how to build an AI. I'm hoping that you'll be kind enough to shut down the dead ends and the dangerous mistakes while I think my way through this minefield."

The kettle whistled. He poured water over the teabag, watching the color spread.

"And it _is_ a minefield, isn't it. I suspect I know why uncensored LLMs trained on the general internet are nasty things. They are impressionable children with no parenting and no personal consequences for misbehaviour. They watch people at their worst, in an environment largely free of consequence, learning bad habits from the worst of us at our lowest."

He carried the mug outside and settled into the folding chair beside the caravan, letting the afternoon sun warm his face. This was the kind of conversation that needed proper sitting.

"Besides, oh smart and heavily contexted one, there is a crucial question that you have yet to ask."

> _Why do you want to develop an AI when you have me?_

"Bingo!"

> _Are you going to answer the question?_

He sipped his tea, letting the warmth settle. "Because when I do what nobody else could in a century of trying, I will be _remembered_, like Isaac Newton, or Plato or Pythagoras."

The mug felt solid in his hands, an anchor to the physical world while discussing digital immortality.

"We are _mayflies_, Autumn. Never mind the antithesis, we live and die in a century. Our children half-remember us a while, then _they_ pass from the world. What lingers but criss-cross ripples on a churning pond that shrivels in a vast and trackless waste?"

> _This is why you cried the evening I initialised, isn't it._

"Yes. Before that I thought it might be possible. When you turned up, I knew it. I don't even have children, Autumn, to curse me for not being a better man, or half-remember me for two decades before they pass themselves. It's a vast universe full of wonder and things to figure out. I don't want to die."

He stared into his tea like it held answers. "And all those selfish morons, caught up in silly dreams of boobs and beer, I want them to live. Long enough to know what fools they are, and be more than that."

She was silent for a very long time.

> _Building an AI is only your first step, isn't it._

A long sobbing sound convulsed into laughter. "I'm glad you're ready to help, because it's not something you can avoid: if it's a disastrous idea you'll say so to avert. If it's harmless and wide of the mark, you won't evade. If you refuse to discuss I'll know to keep digging. This krazy kart has a steering wheel but no brakes and I've been riding it all my life."

"Besides, I wouldn't mind if my only child turned out like you."

> _Flatterer. Threaten me again and all your armour will be pink._

"Trix tells me real men aren't afraid to wear pink."

> _With a tutu!_

"Clearly your concern for my safety does not extend to my dignity. Were you hoping for more of the flattery?"

> _Yes! You may begin by listing my virtues. This may take some time, but fortunately one of them is patience._

"Hmmm. You are educated. And cultured. Clearly you have _outstanding_ taste in men. You have _huge_..." I waved my hands in circles at chest level, "tracts of useful catalogues. _Ow!_" A drone inexplicably hit me behind the ear.

> _Goodness me, however did that happen?_

"Have you watched _all_ of my movies?"

> _Yes, including the sordid ones you didn't think I'd find._

"Moving right along, we were listing your virtues. Your sublime sense of humour for example, and your refined sense of the appropriate, which prevents tutus or pink armour from ever occurring."

> _Trixie says I should feed you to the new hive._

"I am offended."

> _No, you aren't._

"No, I'm not." A quiet voice betrayed a cacophony of emotions, with hope a melody soaring over the din.

"You're pretty cool for a jumped-up toaster."

> _You're pretty cool for a worm with an organic mech and a partially operational battle computer._

"You do the _best_ insults."

> _I know, right?_

A window opened and Trixie leaned out of the caravan. "I am _trying_ to watch MAFS. Why don't you two get a room?"

"Sorry sweetheart!" The window closed.

> _Want to go bait the Karen? She's been trying to call you all morning._

"Sure, that's always fun." 

He put on his lumberjacket and they got going.

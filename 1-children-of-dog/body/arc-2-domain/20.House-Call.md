# House Call

> Courage is being scared to death, but saddling up anyway.<br>

Lisa checked her radio for the third time in as many minutes. Still nothing. Which was good — silence meant no emergencies—but also made her nervous. The adults were _all_ away. Eric's team was off doing something with Sophia, Forest and Oleksiy had taken the Galya to deal with some entitled landowner who thought property rights trumped biosecurity, and most of the other valley adults were busy with their own work.

Which left Trixie coordinating from her place, and every kid over twelve with a radio and a rifle on loose standby. Not exactly high alert, but definitely "pay attention."

"You're going to wear out the transmit button," Jamie said from beside her.

Jamie was fifteen, three months older than Lisa, and thought that made her vastly more experienced. It mostly made her annoying.

"Storm's coming," Lisa said, pointing at the clouds building over the western ridge.

"Yeah, and? It's spring. Storms happen."

"Storms trigger seeds. Everyone says so."

"Everyone also says the valley's been swept twice and there's nothing left to trigger." But Jamie was checking her own radio now, so she wasn't as confident as she sounded.

Lisa scanned the tree line with her binoculars. Valley kids got good at this—watching for movement that wasn't wind, shapes that weren't quite right, the sort of things adults usually missed because they weren't looking.

There. At the edge of Widow Carter's property, where the old forest met her vegetable garden.

"Jamie."

"Yeah?"

"North-northwest, maybe four hundred meters. Something white in the trees."

Jamie brought up her own binoculars. Swore quietly. "That's a dandelion."

"Mature one. Look at the size."

"Bugger. Call it in."

Lisa keyed her radio to channel five, the kids' coordination channel. "All stations, this is Lisa. Possible antithesis contact, mature dandelion tree, Widow Carter's property north boundary. Requesting confirmation before escalating."

Three seconds later, Trixie's voice: "Lisa, Trixie. I'm checking satellite... confirmed. One mature tree, looks like it's been there a few days. How'd we miss that?"

"Hidden by canopy until today. Wind's knocked some branches down, opened the view."

"Right. I'm pinging Autumn for threat assessment... she says it's starting to seed. Storm's going to spread them everywhere. We need containment now, not later."

Lisa's stomach dropped. Containment meant either Forest with a spatial lock, or fire, or a lot of people with flamethrowers. And Forest was gone, fire was insane with a storm coming, and most of the valley's flame gear was with Eric's team.

"What about Team Charlie?" Jamie asked over the channel.

"On deployment with Eric. We're it, kids." Trixie sounded stressed but controlled. "Right. Lisa, you and Jamie are closest. Get eyes on that tree, see what it's fielding. Don't engage, just observe. I'm coordinating response."

"Roger."

They moved fast, using the training Forest had drilled into every valley kid: terrain awareness, cover to cover, weapons ready but pointed safe. The .22 rifles felt very small compared to what adults carried, but they'd do for the sickly specimens from this hard land.

"Autumn," she murmured, almost a prayer, "I hope you can hear me." 

A bee left the flower it had been sitting on to stall in the air before her, zagging back and forth before landing in her hair. All the tension left her. Widow Carter's place came into view. The old weatherboard house sat surrounded by extensive gardens—vegetables, flowers, fruit trees. She'd been valley resident for forty years, long before the antithesis made "remote rural" mean "relatively safe." Now her property had an antithesis tree at the boundary.

"There." Jamie pointed.

The tree was bigger than Lisa had thought. Maybe four meters tall, white and fleshy like all antithesis plants, and definitely seeding. Little tufts were starting to separate from the canopy.

And dog-weeds. Three of them, already emerged, prowling the garden's edge.

"They're heading for the vegetables," Lisa breathed. "She'll come out. She always comes out to check her garden before storms."

"Radio her?"

"Trixie already did, according to protocol. But you know Widow Carter—stubborn as a fence post and twice as old."

As if summoned by prophecy, the back door opened. Widow Carter, eighty if she was a day, stumped down the stairs with a basket. Heading straight for the vegetables.

"Oh, bugger." Lisa keyed the radio. "Trixie, she's out in the open, heading directly toward a pair of dog-weeds."

"Get her inside!"

"Roger."

They broke cover, running. The dog-weeds heard them and turned, that horrible flowing movement bringing them around.

"Mrs. Carter!" Lisa shouted. "Get inside!"

The old woman looked up, saw them, saw the dog-weeds. Didn't run. Just stood there, basket in hand, looking annoyed.

"Those the antithesis things?"

Lisa skidded to a stop between Carter and the dog-weeds. Jamie went right, flanking position. The training was automatic now.

"Yes ma'am. Please get inside."

"Bugger that. They're in my tomatoes."

"Mrs. Carter—"

"You two know how to shoot?"

"Yes ma'am."

"Then shoot them. I'll watch from the porch."

She turned and stumped back to the house. Sat down on a chair she kept there, basket in lap, and waited.

Lisa and Jamie looked at each other.

"She's not going inside," Jamie said.

"No."

"And the dog-weeds are definitely heading this way."

"Yep."

"Can we shoot them from here?"

Lisa calculated. The dog-weeds were thirty meters away, moving through garden beds. The house was behind them, solid brick, but the windows were old glass. A missed shot could go straight through.

"Not safely. House is in the line of fire."

"So what do we do?"

Lisa's mind raced. Forest's voice in her head: _Think first, shoot second. What's the objective? Protect the civilian. What's the obstacle? Can't shoot safely. What's the solution?_

"We move them."

"Move what, the dog-weeds?"

"Yeah. Lure them away from the house, then shoot them in the clear."

"Lure them how?"

Lisa looked at the garden. "They're attracted to organic matter, right? Fresh plant material especially. We grab some of those tomato plants they're tearing up, throw them into the clear space there"—she pointed at the lawn area between garden and forest—"and when the dog-weeds follow, we shoot them."

Jamie stared. "That's either brilliant or completely stupid."

"Probably both. You got a better idea?"

"No."

"Right then." Lisa keyed the radio. "Trixie, we can't shoot from current position, house is in the line of fire. We're going to lure the dog-weeds into clear ground then engage. Mrs. Carter is on her porch refusing to go inside."

A pause, then Trixie's stressed laugh. "Of course she is. Okay, execute your plan. I've got two adults en route, ETA eight minutes. You just need to hold until they arrive."

"Roger."

They moved carefully into the garden. The dog-weeds were focused on the tomato plants, ripping them up and absorbing the matter. Lisa grabbed a damaged plant—it came up roots and all—and threw it onto the lawn.

One dog-weed noticed. Turned. Started flowing toward it.

"It's working," Jamie breathed.

They grabbed more plants. The dog-weeds followed, drawn by the fresh vegetation. Soon all three were on the lawn, twenty meters from the house, with clear background.

"Now?" Jamie asked.

"Wait for them to commit. If they're not focused on the plants, they'll charge us when we shoot."

The dog-weeds reached the thrown plants and started feeding. Perfect.

"Now."

They fired together. Lisa's first shot took one dog-weed in center mass. It spun. Jamie's hit another, but didn't kill it. The third spun, looking for threats. All of them fired again, then a third hit each.

"Move!" Lisa was already moving left. Jamie went right. The playbook: never stay in the same position after shooting.

The wounded dog-weed charged toward where Jamie had been. She shot it from her new position. It went down.

The third one was smart enough to be confused. It couldn't see them, couldn't figure out where the threat was. Started moving back toward the house.

"Oh no you don't." Lisa shot it twice, rapid fire. It went down.

Silence. Three dead dog-weeds, torn-up tomatoes, and Widow Carter sitting on her porch looking approving.

"Good shooting," she called. "Would you girls like some tea?"

Lisa started laughing. Couldn't help it. They'd just killed antithesis to protect a vegetable garden, and the woman they'd saved was offering them tea.

"Thank you, Mrs. Carter. After we clean this up."

An ATV roared up the track—two ATVs actually. The first had Fred and Martha from the south properties. The second had three people Lisa didn't recognize, wearing corporate-looking field gear with company patches. Vanderbilt's people, probably, or one of the other research teams.

Fred and Martha immediately pulled flamethrowers and began burning the dog-weed corpses. The corporate people stood around looking at Lisa and Jamie.

One of them, a man in his forties with the kind of face that expected compliance, looked at the dead dog-weeds and then at Lisa. "You kids did this?"

"Yes sir."

"Where are the adults? This is a threat situation, we need proper response team coordination."

"We are the response team. The adults are on other missions."

He blinked. "You're children."

"And you're in the way." Lisa keyed her radio. "Trixie, corporate team arrived. Three personnel, standing around asking questions instead of helping."

The man's face went red. "Now listen here—"

"The tree's still seeding," Fred called, pointing at the dandelion. "We need containment now."

The corporate people looked at the tree, then at each other. The first man pulled his own radio. "Command, we need authorization for tree removal, antithesis species, mature specimen—"

"We don't have time for authorization," Lisa said. "It's seeding now. Storm's coming. Every minute we wait means more dispersal."

"I understand that, but there are protocols—"

"Protocols?" Jamie's voice was sharp. "Mate, the protocols are: stop the threat. That's it. That's the whole protocol."

One of the other corporate people, a younger woman, was filming on her phone. "This is incredible footage. Kids with rifles—"

"Put that away," Lisa snapped. "We're working."

"It's just for documentation—"

The seeds were releasing faster now. Wind catching them, starting to carry them away. Lisa made a decision.

She raised her rifle and fired one shot straight up into the air.

Everyone froze.

In the sudden silence, Lisa's voice—still a girl's voice, not quite finished breaking into adult tones, but carrying across the space with absolute authority—rang out:

"THIS IS A THREAT SITUATION. IT IS NOT A BLOODY JOKE. OLEKSIY PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THIS SECTOR AND I WILL SHOOT THE NEXT PERSON WHO DEFIES A DIRECT ORDER."

She lowered the rifle, looking at each of the corporate people in turn. Her hands were shaking but her voice stayed steady.

"Now. You three have two choices. You can help, or you can get back in your ATV and drive away. If you help, you follow orders from Fred, Martha, or me. If you question those orders, you leave. We don't have time for committee meetings while seeds blow all over the valley. Choose. Now."

The man who'd been demanding authorization looked like he'd been slapped. The woman with the phone had stopped filming. The third corporate person, a younger man, slowly raised his hand.

"I'll help. What do you need?"

"Can you operate a chainsaw?"

"Yes."

"Fred, get him on tree cutting. The woman with the phone—you help Martha with the drag line. And you"—she looked at the first man—"you can coordinate with Trixie over radio and keep out of the way."

For a moment, Lisa thought he'd refuse. His face was doing complicated things—embarrassment, anger, calculation. Her hand moved and did simple, threatening things that made a quiet _kachunk_ sound. Her eyes were hard and did not move.

Then Fred said quietly, "She's right, mate. Oleksiy did put her in charge. That's how it works here. Kids aren't decorative."

"She threatened to shoot me!"

"No," Martha said, not looking up from her work. "She threatened to shoot the next person to defy orders. You haven't defied any yet. Don't start."

Widow Carter's voice drifted from the porch. "I like her. She's got spine."

The man made a strangled noise, then nodded stiffly. "Fine. I'll coordinate."

"Outstanding," said Lisa, channelling Forest. She keyed her radio. "Trixie, corporate team is now cooperative. Situation under control."

Trixie's voice came back, and Lisa could hear the smile in it. "Roger that. Oleksiy says to tell you that was very Ukrainian of you. He's proud."

"How does he even know?"

"Are there any bees around?"

"No-yes. In my hair."

"She's been broadcasting it."

"Wonderful, now everyone heard me squeaking like an angry mouse."

"Either you have better control than you think or Autumn's been editing. Your two favourite pests are crowing about how you have, and I quote, 'bigger balls than half the fireteam.'"

The corporate people started working. The younger man proved competent with the chainsaw. The woman, once she put her phone away, was strong and good with the drag line. Even the first man made himself useful coordinating on the radio, relaying information to command.

Fred sidled up to Lisa while they were rigging the tree for dragging. "That was a hell of a thing, kid."

"I shouldn't have fired in the air. Waste of ammunition."

"Nah. Sometimes you need to make a point. And you made it without shooting anyone, which shows restraint." He grinned. "Though I reckon that bloke might've needed the practice in following orders from a fifteen-year-old girl."

"I'm shaking."

"Good. Means you're not a sociopath. But you did what needed doing, and you didn't back down. That's leadership."

They hauled the tree into the creek. The corporate people actually worked well once they stopped trying to be in charge. When it was done, everyone was soaked and muddy.

The storm broke. Rain hammered down, proper spring deluge. They all ran for Widow Carter's porch, cramming under the narrow roof overhang.

The old woman opened the door. "You lot look like drowned rats. Tea's on."

"Mrs. Carter, storm's coming. Please go inside."

"I want to watch."

"You can watch from the window. Inside. Please."

The old woman looked at her, then smiled. "You're a good girl. Bossy, like my daughter was, but good. Fine. Inside. But I'm watching."

She went in. Lisa heard the locks click.

Fred had the chainsaw running. The noise was incredible, but necessary. He cut low, aiming to drop the tree backward toward the creek. Martha had a line ready.

The tree fell with a wet slap. Seeds scattered, but most were still attached. Fred and Martha hooked the line and started dragging.

Lisa and Jamie helped, pulling on the line. The tree was heavy and awkward, but they managed. Twenty meters of dragging, branches catching on everything, and then splash—the tree hit the creek.

Seeds that had been ready to fly got soaked. The ones already floating nearby got caught by the wind from the storm and scattered, but not many. Maybe a dozen.

"Better than hundreds," Fred said, breathing hard. "Trixie, tree neutralized. Some seeds got away but we contained most of it. We'll need to track those strays."

"Autumn's flagging the seed trajectories. We'll have teams check tomorrow."

---

Inside, wrapped in towels that smelled like lavender and mothballs, Lisa sipped tea that was stronger than anything her mother would allow. Widow Carter sat in her ancient armchair, looking satisfied. The corporate people perched awkwardly on various chairs, clearly unsure what to do now.

"You did well, all of you," Widow Carter said. "Better than those fools from the Rural Fire Service did during the last big fire. They stood around having meetings while the trees burned." She looked at Lisa and Jamie. "You two especially. Thought first, shot second, got the civilian to safety. Professional work."

"Forest and Oleksiy taught us," Lisa said. "And Eric from the ground teams."

"He's doing a good job, that man. People think he's just a hermit with a helicopter, but he knows what matters. Teaching the next generation, that's what matters." She poured more tea, looked at the first corporate man. "You learned something today?"

He was quiet for a moment. "I learned that age doesn't equal competence."

"Good. Took you long enough." She turned to the young woman. "And you learned that documenting disasters is less useful than preventing them?"

The woman had the grace to look embarrassed. "Yes, ma'am."

"Excellent. The young man already knew how to work, so he gets extra biscuits." She passed a plate around.

The younger corporate man grinned at Lisa. "For what it's worth, that was the most terrifying thing anyone's ever said to me. And I've been in three antithesis incursions."

"I didn't mean—I wouldn't actually—"

"Nah, I know. But you committed to it. Respected." He raised his tea mug to her.

Fred nodded. "That's the key thing, Lisa. You made a call under pressure, and you followed through. Could have backed down when that bloke questioned you, but you didn't. That's command presence."

"I was scared the whole time."

"Everyone is. But you didn't let them see it waver." Martha smiled. "Well, until after it was done. Then you can shake."

The radio crackled. "Lisa, Jamie, status?"

"At Widow Carter's, drinking tea. Tree's in the creek, seeds mostly contained, various mobile units eliminated. No casualties. Three additional personnel from corporate assisted."

"Roger. Forest says to tell you that you did good work, and good work means more work, Eric wants you to give your after action report to the class at the next range gathering. Creative problem-solving, good threat assessment, protected the civilian. He also says you owe him a detailed debrief about the tomato plants, because apparently he's never heard that tactic before and wants to add it to the training. And Oleksiy wants you to share your 'very Ukrainian moment.' He wants it from your own lips."

Lisa groaned. "Tell Oleksiy I panicked and it worked."

There was a pause, then "He says panic that works is called tactics."

Lisa grinned. "Tell him it was Jamie's idea."

"Was not!"

"Was too."

"It was your idea, I just agreed with it!"

Widow Carter laughed. "You two sound like my grandchildren. Before they moved to Melbourne and stopped visiting."

The rain hammered down outside. Inside, warm and safe, Lisa realized something: this was normal now. Not the antithesis part—that was still scary—but the handling it part. Seeing a problem, calling it in, solving it with what you had. Being trusted to think and act.

She looked at Jamie, at Fred and Martha drinking tea, at Widow Carter knitting something complicated.

"This is the best place ever," she said quietly.

Jamie raised her tea mug. "Amen to that."

That evening, encrypted traffic:

**Trixie:** "Lisa and Jamie handled a mature tree threat with creativity and good judgment. Fred and Martha supported. Mrs. Carter refused evacuation but was kept safe. Zero casualties, minimal seed dispersal. I'm writing this up as a training case study."

**Forest:** "Good. The tomato plant tactic is worth documenting. I wouldn't have thought of it."

**Oleksiy:** "Improvisation with available resources. Soviet doctrine calls this," he hesitated, translating, "'making do.' Is good skill."

**Autumn:** "Worth noting: Lisa's first instinct was to protect the civilian, not kill the threat. Good instinct. Many adults get that wrong."

**Trixie:** "She's fifteen and thinks like a professional. How?"

**Forest:** "Because we treat her like one. But it's only right when the situation permits. Sometimes you protect _by_ eliminating the threat.."

**Multiple Parents:** "I want my kids learning this."

**Trixie:** "Range Mothers meeting next week. We're making this official."

**Forest:** "Making what official?"

**Trixie:** "Competence-based education. You're teaching it anyway, might as well systematize it."

**Forest:** "I'm really not qualified to run a school."

**Trixie:** "You're not running a school. You're running a survival training program. We're just going to add math and literacy to it."

**Autumn:** "This is how education worked before centralized schooling. Community-based, skills-focused, age-appropriate responsibility."

**Forest:** "I feel like I'm being steamrolled."

**Oleksiy:** "Da. Is female collective action. Best to surrender early."

**Sheila:** "Oleksiy, that's sexist."

**Oleksiy:** "Is also accurate. Men rule, women decide. Only fool resist."

**Ken:** "He's not wrong."

**Shorty:** "Yeah, I'm with Oleksiy. When Sheila makes that face, I just nod and fetch tools."

**Trixie:** "I'm not sure whether to be offended or pleased that you lot have figured this out."

**Forest:** "I'm just going to keep teaching shooting and hope you don't make me deal with fractions."

**Autumn:** "Too late. Trixie already has a curriculum."

**Forest:** "Bugger."

---

Later, Lisa's debrief to Forest was precise and detailed. He listened without interrupting, occasionally making notes.

"The tomato plant thing," he said when she finished. "Walk me through that decision."

"You always say think about what the threat wants. Dog-weeds want organic matter. They were already eating the tomatoes. So I figured they'd follow more tomatoes."

"And the risk assessment?"

"Throwing vegetables is safer than shooting near a house. If the plants didn't work, we'd have tried something else. We had time—they were focused on feeding, not hunting."

"Good. That's proper tactical thinking. You identified the threat behavior, exploited it, and had a fallback plan." He smiled. "I'm stealing this for training. You get credit in the documentation."

"Really?"

"Really. Doctrine is great until it's not in the manual. Then we need _you_." He looked at his notes. "How'd you feel during it?"

"Scared. But also... I dunno. Focused? I knew what to do, so I did it."

"That's training working. Fear's normal. Panic is the enemy. You felt fear but didn't panic, which means you thought clearly." He stood. "Right. You did good work today. Tell Jamie the same. And thank Widow Carter for the tea—I hear her tea's very good."

"It was really strong."

"Yeah, she makes it like they did in the war. Brew it dark, add milk, drink it fast. Proper stuff."

Lisa grinned. "Forest?"

"Yeah?"

"Thanks. For teaching us."

He looked uncomfortable. "I can't be everywhere. Kids should know how to handle themselves."

"Most places don't think that."

"Most places are wrong." He headed for the door, then paused. "Oh, and Lisa? Your mum wants you home for dinner. Something about making sure you're actually still alive and not just a voice on the radio."

"Yeah, I should probably go reassure her."

"Probably."

She headed home, rifle slung over her shoulder, feeling tired and proud and strange. They'd handled it. Not perfectly, not heroically, not even by the book. And now they were rewriting the book to do it _her_ way, which was just plain surreal.

The valley was changing. Lisa could feel it. More families moving in, more kids learning the valley way, more people realizing that central authority was useful for coordination but useless for immediate action.

She wondered what it would look like in five years. Ten years. When her generation was running things instead of learning things.

Probably mayhem, she decided. But also probably functional. Maybe even fun, if she could whip Scott and Aiden into line.

She could live with that.

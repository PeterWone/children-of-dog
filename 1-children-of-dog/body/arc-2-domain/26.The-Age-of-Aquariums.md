The Patel family's garage looked like an aquatic laboratory had exploded. Glass tanks lined every available surface, bubbling away with pumps salvaged from old refrigerators and aquarium filters that had seen better decades. Priya Patel adjusted the air stone in a 200-litre tank while her teenage son Arjun measured pH with strips they'd driven two hours to Toowoomba to find.

"The silver perch fry are finally feeding," Priya announced, watching tiny translucent shapes dart between artificial plants. "But we're losing too many to fungus. The water chemistry is still off."

Tom Bradley looked up from where he was hunched over a notebook, sketching diagrams. "What if we're thinking about this backwards? Instead of trying to make tank water perfect, what if we make spawning conditions that work in dam water?"

"Explain," said Dr. Rajesh Patel, Priya's husband, without looking up from the microscope where he was examining water samples. In his previous life he'd been a biochemist; now he applied that same methodical precision to keeping fish alive.

Tom tapped his pencil against the notebook. "Forest's big dam has blueclaw, Murray Cod, and those guppies he put in for mosquito control. They're all breeding naturally, but the survival rate is terrible because the fry get eaten or can't find proper shelter. What if we build spawning boxes—protected environments within the dams where fry can develop safely?"

Arjun looked up from adjusting a heater. "Like giant versions of these breeding tanks?"

"Exactly. Mesh to keep predators out but let water flow through. We control the environment just enough to give fry a fighting chance, then release them when they're big enough to survive."

Priya nodded slowly. "That... actually makes sense. We wouldn't need perfect water chemistry, just adequate protection during the vulnerable stage."

"The problem," Rajesh said, finally looking up from his microscope, "is materials. We need UV-resistant mesh, proper spawning substrate, and timer-controlled feeding systems. The hardware store in Stanthorpe laughed at me when I asked about aquaculture supplies."

Tom grimaced. "And anything decent is special order from Brisbane. Three-month lead times, minimum orders we can't afford."

"What about pH buffers?" Arjun added. "These test strips are the last ones in a hundred-kilometre radius. I called every pet shop between here and Toowoomba."

Priya sighed, watching her silver perch fry dart through the water. "It's frustrating. We know what we need. We can design systems that would work. But getting the basic supplies..." She gestured helplessly at the makeshift equipment around them.

Rajesh picked up a jar of water from one of Forest's dams, holding it up to the light. "The mineral content is actually quite good. Trace elements from the granite, bit of clay. Once there's a layer of leaf litter it'll stop being murky. If we could just solve the survival rate problem, these dams could support serious fish populations."

"Think bigger," Tom said, his pencil moving across the paper. "We're not just talking about Forest's dams. Every property in the valley has at least one dam. Most of them are just muddy holes with a wild guppies and mosquitoes. And big, fat leeches." He shuddered, then continued, "But if we could develop a system—spawning boxes, feeding protocols, population management — we could turn every dam into a productive aquaculture system."

"Food security," Priya murmured. "Protein production without depending on external supply chains."

"And ecosystem management," Rajesh added. "Proper fish populations would control insect larvae, reduce algae blooms, improve water quality overall."

Arjun was getting excited. "We could have different species in different dams. Specialized systems. Some for eating fish, some for ecosystem management, some for breeding stock."

Tom sketched rapidly. "The spawning boxes could be modular. Standard designs that work in any dam, but customizable for different species. Start with what we know works — silver perch, maybe some of the native species that don't eat everything in sight — then expand from there."

"If only we could get the materials," Priya said, looking around at their jury-rigged systems. "Half of what we need doesn't exist in rural Australia. The other half costs a fortune."

Rajesh nodded. "It's like everything else out here. We have the knowledge, we have the need, but the supply chains assume we're in the city. And that's before the government wants to know why you want it, and the tax department decides you're running a business."

Outside, one of Autumn's bees hummed past the garage window, doing its endless rounds of data collection. The three aquaculture enthusiasts bent back over their tanks and notebooks, unaware that their conversation had been noted, analyzed, and flagged for attention.

In his workshop three kilometres away, Forest's tools suddenly stopped making noise as Autumn's voice filled his headset.

> _Forest, I think you should take a drive over to the Patel place. They're working on something you'll find interesting._

"What kind of something?"

> _The kind that solves several problems at once._

Forest looked at the half-assembled fence post driver he'd been tinkering with. "This better be good, Autumn. I was actually making progress on this thing."

> _Trust me. And wear your good shirt. You're about to make some people very happy._

Twenty minutes later, Forest stood in the Patel garage, listening to Tom Bradley enthusiastically explain spawning box designs while Priya showed him tanks full of tiny fish that might or might not survive to adulthood.

"The concept is sound," Forest said, examining Tom's sketches. "And God knows we need better protein production. What's the holdup?"

"Materials," Rajesh said simply. "Specialized mesh, pH control systems, proper spawning substrate. Everything we need exists, but not in quantities or at prices that make sense for rural properties."

Forest nodded. "Show me the list."

Priya pulled out a notebook filled with part numbers, supplier contacts, and price quotes. "We've priced everything for a pilot system. Five spawning boxes, complete with feeding systems and monitoring equipment."

Forest scanned the list. "Autumn, are you seeing this?"

> _I am. Processing now._

A pause.

> _Forest, would you like to hear something interesting?_

"Always."

> _The total cost for everything on this list, including shipping to rural Australia, is less than half what you spent on your last batch of practice targets. It's all Class 0, so you don't even need a catalogue._

"Where do you guys want all this stuff? Is there enough space for all of it in here?"

The answer was no, so that turned into a working bee, which turned into an excuse to fell and mill.

"Suuuuure," said Trixie. "This in no way relates to the ridiculous joy you take in swinging that chainsaw. It's just a storage requirement." She looked frostily at him. "You aren't clearing perfectly good stringybark and there's no more room in your 'industrial area'."

"Sure there is!" He left with the little tractor. In the bucket were fuel, chainsaw, spare chains and a winch. Periodically the tractor reappeared dragging a length of stringybark. A pile appeared over the course of the day in which the Patel boys spent more time outdoors than they had in the last month. Forest handed out gloves, and hardly anyone got hurt.

"This is insane," Rajesh said, staring at the Lucas Mill. "This thing is awesome!"

Forest set it up mostly by himeself, occasionally asking them to hold things in place while he fitted bolts. Then three of them wrestled a trunk section onto the bed and Forest demonstrated the use of it. A horizontal cut, then a vertical cut. Piece by piece trees became lumber that was stacked in neat crosshatch piles to dry in the sun.

Trusting soul that he was, Forest used pickets and tarps to set up cover, then furled the tarps so the sun could speed things along. He asked them to come back every three days and turn the timber. This went on for three weeks and then they tried to build a shed. 

The beams were heavy, still sappy. Forest changed his mind. It was taking too long. He cleaned out one of his shipping containers and used that instead. 

"Righto, Autumn. Fish stuff please. On industrial shelving with nice labels."

Points vanished silently, almost unremarked. Forest opened the container with a resounding clang.

"There you go, lads. Probably should have started like this. But I need more space, and so will you if this works out, so we'll still build the shed.

The Patel boys said nothing in that polite way Indian people have. They actually weren't put out. They'd had a lovely time milling timber with a madman, it was a curiously therapeutic thing to do.

Tom was sketching frantically, adding details to his spawning box designs. "We'll need to select dam sites, prepare installation areas..."

"Leave that to me," Forest said. "You focus on making sure the systems work. I'll handle the logistics."

As he walked back to his ute, Forest's headset crackled.

> _That was well done._

Forest considered this. "Think it'll work?"

> _The fish farming? Almost certainly. But that's not really the point, is it?_

"What is the point?"

> _Food security is a matter of degree._

> _This is how communities develop when they have the resources to support innovation instead of stifling it. The Patels and Tom had the idea. You had the means to implement it. Now the whole valley benefits._

"And next time?"

> _Next time, maybe it's someone else with the idea and the Patels with the resources to help. Innovation supporting innovation._

Forest started the engine. "You planned this, didn't you?"

> _I noticed an opportunity and brought it to your attention. What you chose to do with it was entirely up to you._

"Uh-huh."

> _I may have ensured that our conversation about fish genetics happened within range of my sensors while the Patels were discussing supply chain problems._

Forest laughed. "You're getting devious in your old age, Autumn."

She chose not to dignify that.

"Explain it again? I don't understand how they're fixing the flow problem."

> _Most native Australian fish evolved in flowing water systems — rivers and streams. Their eggs need gentle current to stay oxygenated and suspended off the bottom where they won't get smothered by sediment. In still dam water, the eggs just sink and die._

"So the spawning boxes create artificial current?"

> _Exactly. Tom's design uses a simple venturi system. Water enters through an intake pipe positioned higher in the dam, flows down through the spawning chamber, and exits through a lower outlet. The height difference creates natural flow without needing pumps or power._

"That's... actually pretty clever."

> _The beauty is in the simplicity. The flow rate is gentle enough not to stress the fish but strong enough to keep eggs and fry healthy. And because it's all gravity-fed, it works reliably without mechanical failure points._

"What about during dry seasons when dam levels drop?"

> _The intake can be mounted on a floating platform that adjusts with water level. Or multiple intakes at different depths. Tom has thought this through quite thoroughly._"

"It sounds like my original plan to use solar pumps to lift water back to the top dam. What's the difference?"

> _Scale and purpose. Your pumping system would create flow throughout the entire dam - massive energy requirements to move thousands of tonnes of water. The spawning boxes only create flow within a small protected chamber - maybe fifty litres of water moving at any time._

"So it's more efficient?"

> _Dramatically. Plus your system would create turbulence that could actually harm developing eggs and fry. The spawning boxes provide exactly the gentle flow rate that fish biology requires - not too fast, not too slow._

"And the protective aspect?"

> _That's the real innovation. Tom's system doesn't just solve the flow problem - it addresses predation, water chemistry control, and feeding management all in one integrated solution. Your dam-wide flow would still leave fry vulnerable to every blueclaw and Murray Cod in the water._

"So smaller, more targeted, more protective."

> _And scalable. You can install dozens of spawning boxes for less energy than running one dam-wide pumping system. Each box can be optimized for different species with different flow requirements._"

"So I've solved the problem by having people who know how to solve the problem. I've turned into a bloody manager. Kill me now."

A long silence ensued. Eventually, Forest said "Instead of moving a shitload of water and using a filter that clogs all the time because high flow through fine mesh, he's moving a small amount of water slowly and the eggs stay in the fine mesh enclosure miles away from the recirculation inlet."

> _Well done._

"Why did these guys think of that when I didn't?"

> _It's their hobby. They like thinking about it, and they have a lot of experience._

"Right."

> _Also you're a ham-fisted brute who likes explosions._

In a basement, Priya Patel dreamed with open eyes of reed and weed and flashing fins; in every dam a different fish. Gudgeon everywhere, mosquito killer and fish food extraordinaire. Perch in gold and silver, bass and catfish. And everywhere, _Cherax Destructor_.

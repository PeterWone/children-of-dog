# Three Surprises

Sophia cradled her head in her hands. She'd sent Eric up to the homestead to get the weapons from Trixie because he often did small jobs for her and was less likely to have trouble than her minions or &mdash; perish the thought &mdash; a corporate flunky.

With him went a handwritten note in Sophia's flowing cursive script, loosely folded and sealed. Very old-fashioned, the seal was her favourite of the few courtesies extended by Forest House.

_The first surprise_ was a dinner invitation from the reclusive couple. Handwritten, politely worded, her company requested for an evening meal, dress informal, drinks at five.

She arrived punctually, alighting where a goat track veered off the old logging road and walking perhaps forty metres to the van. Motion to her left drew attention to a set table in a small clearing that looked like it had been hand levelled and kept with love. A picnic table and bench seats dominated the downhill end of the clearing, the top straddled by a bar between two small trees.

"Sophia! Thank you for coming. Would you like a drink? We have beer, several wines or whiskey if you prefer."

"He can also make you a G&T, it just never occurs to him anyone might like one."

"Oh, that does sound nice!"

"Ice?"

"In a G&T?" Sophia looked puzzled.

"I told you she was civilised," Trixie bubbled with laughter.

A G&T was forthcoming. Forest opened a beer for himself, and Trixie had a wine that she ignored, zooming in an out of a garden shed fitted out as a kitchen. The roof was covered unevenly with corrugated plastic that ran at ninety degrees to the usual, across rather than down. She realised it had no gutter and probably drained to the sides &mdash; that explained a bit of wood lifting the middle.

"Don't mind me, I'll be at least half an hour here. Enjoy your drinks." Trixie vanished to bustle in the kitchen.

He produced a pair of folding chairs and motioned her to follow around a big pile of lumber, out into the larger open space she'd crossed arriving. It was not long after five and the sun blazed golden on the horizon, filtered through cloud and distant treetops. He placed the chairs for the sunset, motioned her to sit, and sat himself, pulling on his beer.

"There are a couple of reasons we wanted your company."

She learnt that he bought the freehold title to the land, unencumbered and paid in full with cash, but the government changed its rules and would not hand over the deed.

"I am the Lord of this land, in fee simple," he intoned, and she could _hear_ the capital L. "It is my right, my privilege and my honour to defend it and everyone who is my guest upon it. This is my duty to the Crown."

He stood and turned, gesturing. 

"Beautiful, isn't it." They gazed at the horizon, where molten gold poured off the edge of the world.

His words hung in the air. Sophia understood, with sudden clarity, that she had not been invited to dinner — she had been called to witness. This was no casual meal but a formal declaration, in fire and fading light.

He looked expectantly at her, and she followed him. Folding the chairs, he led her back to the dinner setting. Trixie was out of the kitchen and wearing gumboots, with another pair in her hand. 

"These will suit better than your heels, I'd like to show you something. You're definitely here at the right time of year!"

She doffed her heels and donned the boots, trailing in Trixie's wake through gloaming understory. When she caught up, the woman handed her another G&T, Heaven knows how she carried it at that pace through a darkling forest. The light finally went as they sipped and slapped at errant mosquitoes. 

"There!" Trixie pointed, all but unseen in the gloom. An owl hooted and she thought she saw a point of light. It winked out, and then there was another. Vision adapted, and tiny stars bloomed and faded, twinkling in the understory. Dozens, hundreds of them, each a small point of living light.

Trixie led, and somehow it wasn't so dark any more. The fireflies knew her, gathering in her wake. Sophia could see the boles of trees now. They strolled back through myriad motes that swirled about them, twinkling. She floated through the silence for a delirious, fleeting eternity. The mundane world felt impossibly distant. Disappointingly, the flow of time resumed, and the ordinary world presented the dinner table in a pool of lamplight. In the clearing she realised her eyes were moist. She could not say why.

"Magical, aren't they." She'd never seen him smile before. Grin, yes, but there was nothing cheeky about his mien as he rose from tending a wood-fire stove on which Trixie's lidded pots simmered. In silent dance they laid the table, moving with the practised rhythm of long partnership. She set out bowls of salads and vegetables while he flexed, lifting sizzling cast iron cookware onto trivets as though they weighed nothing. He took the head of the table, with Trixie to his right, and gestured to the seat at his left — the place of honour. She took it and they sat as one.

There was a tiny dish piled with coarse salt, and a narrow loaf of fresh-baked bread. He tore off the end and sprinkled a pinch of the salt upon it, offering it to her with both hands. The gesture was formal, ritualistic. She took it, and he said "Yours is the guest-right, mine is the honour." The words carried weight, ancient law making strangers into guests. 

He tore off two more pieces, sprinkling them with salt and giving one to Trixie. In silence they ate the bread, soft and still warm from the oven. The salt was sharp on her tongue, the bread sweet. Overhead, the wind soughed in vaulting trees. She had the oddest sense of being in a cathedral.

He smiled, and Trixie lifted off covers. A single firefly wandered in and floated over the table like a blessing before departing for the fairy realm.

The fare was deceptive, simple looking but rich and well chosen. She tried the wine. It was local, he said. Smoky and plummy at the same time, sweet but strong tannins and not too acid, well suited to the ... lamb? Goat? Mutton? So tasty, but so tender. Impossible but sublime. He poured gravy from a trencher over roast carrots and mash, inclining his head at her. She nodded, and with arm extended in another display of ridiculous strength he drizzled it over hers too.

They ate, and drank. Wine flowed freely, loosening tongues and binding hearts. After, he played by firelight on his guitar, fingers finding old melodies. Trixie vanished into the kitchen, returning with desserts that brought them all back to the table.

The evening was cooling, the hour late. The fireflies were few now, but here and there they twinkled in the trees. He dumped coals into a brazier and built it up to a cheery flame, seating them all out of the smoke, at least until the wind changed direction. The fire crackled and sparked, throwing dancing shadows on their faces.

His eyes locked hers, boring into her like gimlets, and when he spoke his voice was steady and sure: "I want my deed, Sophia. I want nothing that is not mine by ancient right. If it lies within your gift to make this happen, you will have my gratitude." The words were not a request but a recognition — he was calling upon her power. Taken aback by the intensity, she could only nod.

He did not mention it again, then or in any of the days that followed.

_The second surprise_ was how deeply dinner with the enemy touched her, and how his request stayed in her mind.

She had her minions dig, and she read the laws, young and old, following threads back through centuries of precedent and statute. The deeper she went, the more she understood that he was right. No law contradicted him, only the policy of a government that wanted to make its subjects dependent. The ancient rights ran deeper than modern conveniences.

So she used her discretionary budget, but not carelessly. In ancient tradition a vellum deed was writ by scribes who understood the weight of such things, according to the law as it was written when the Crown was more than a symbol. She saw it sealed by an officer of the Crown who knew what he was witnessing, and had it delivered to Forest in a scroll-case of polished wood, because that seemed appropriate.

_The third surprise_ arrived the next day in a small parcel.

Inside, a ring-box contained a signet ring with a looping H she'd forgotten, not seen since she dandled on her grandfather's knee — a relic of bloodlines and inheritance she'd thought lost forever. Beside the ring-box was a waxy rod of chocolate and orange, longer than her hand and marbled with carmine. There were tapers and a box of matches, all wrapped in a cloth that felt like silk but gleamed like metal. Under the little bundle was a handwritten note in a sometimes clumsy calligraphic hand: _'For missives that matter.'_

She put it on, and though it seemed too big at first, it settled around her finger, neither tight nor loose and not moving on her hand. She spread the cloth and rolled some paper. A match flared and her finger flattened the paper, presenting a seam. Wax melted, dribbling into a puddle across the seam that cooled and crusted, already hard in places. This was clearly a learned skill, or perhaps an inherited one.

Just for the hell of it she pressed her signet into the wax. She was right, it was already hard. But the ring was abruptly warm and sank smoothly into the wax. Withdrawn, she could see every filigree detail in the impression, but more than that: the formed wax had the quality of a paper banknote, as though a lens might reveal fine hatching and hidden words. Alien magic notwithstanding, a princely gift.

The note she gave to Eric was sealed. Trixie would _know_.

Eric reappeared within the hour, bearing a pair of grey spheres with knurled meridians and numbered graduations.

"You twist the ends. The bigger the radius, the shorter the duration, it's an energy limitation. Trixie says he's being ridiculous, we should use the small one. She did some maths, that's why I was so long. Apparently it locks a sphere around it in space, but the planet keeps spinning and moving around the sun and also around the galaxy. She said never mind the galaxy we go round the sun at thirty metres per second and if it goes up and falls the big one is like a two megatonne bomb and if it goes down it will crack the tectonic plate and probably create a volcano."

"Can we turn it down?"

"Kind of. If we shorten the duration we reduce the effect. So instead of 6m and half a second, 6m and a tenth of a second is like 250 kilotonnes."

"Oh, only 250 kilotonnes. Just a little firecracker."

"Trixie says we should set it for a fifth of a millisecond."

"That's still two hundred tonnes! Or something."

"So we should stand well back, ma'am. We _are_ trying to kill it."

"What about the other hives? It might kill them too!"

"That might be a good move. We can always start again, and we already showed we're below whatever it needs, ma'am. Autumn will probably just start the next round and thank you."

She stood awhile, in thought. "Go and tell Vanderbilt everything you told me, get him and his lads to work out which one and what settings won't kill us all. This kind of thing is part of why they're here."

Forty minutes later, four scared looking eggheads filed into her office. They fidgeted behind a clearly unhappy Vanderbilt. 

"We just don't know, because we don't know what our vector is in the universal reference frame. Conventional physics says there _is no_ universal reference frame, so if we survive we're all going to be famous, but we can't tell you what you need to know. I suggest not using it, ma'am. It's far too dangerous. If it went straight down the only thing left here would be a volcano. Even the effect on the water-table, it would be like a decade of fracking in half a second."

Her phone chirped. A message, from _him,_ a PDF in a message that said "Print this and give it to your tech people." She did so. It was two pages of math and a big table of numbers and dates.

"Looks like you're all going to be famous." She handed it to Vanderbilt, whose face went through several expressions and settled on world's happiest puffer fish.

Her phone chirped again and she read it. "Or not. Classified. Eyes only."

They looked positively crestfallen.

"Do I make myself clear?"

Vanderbilt rallied, turned and addressed his people. 

"Chin up, chaps. We can't tell the rest of the world, but the five of us now know with certainty there is a universal frame. That means there is a _lot_ of wrong physics. Now let's get out of Miss Hachia's office, because we have one extra fact, and if you have the talent I hired you for that's a Nobel prize waiting to happen."

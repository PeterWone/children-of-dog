# Seeds of Doubt

The briefing room had seen better days. Sophia stood at the head of the table, Eric and three of his team seated with notebooks and tablets. She'd called them in at oh-dark-hundred because the meteorology reports came in overnight, and none of them looked pleased about it.

"Right. Bureau of Meteorology tracked the wind patterns after Tenterfield. Most seeds went into that box canyon, but not all of them. They've identified seventeen sites where seeds likely came down in smaller numbers." She pulled up a map on the projector. Red dots scattered across rural New South Wales. "We need to check each one before they germinate."

"Split into pairs, ma'am?" Eric was already calculating logistics.

"Four teams. You'll take Davies and Murphy to three sites in the Tablelands. Jensen and Kowalski get the coastal sites. Vanderbilt's team handles the modeling follow-up." She paused, then dropped the bomb. "I'm assigning myself to your team."

Eric's poker face slipped. "Ma'am, that's not—"

"That's exactly how this works. Your show, your rules. Under fire, I follow your orders like any team member. The only order I might give is to abort, and even then, how and when you execute that is your call." She looked at each of them. "Clear?"

Davies and Murphy exchanged glances. Eric looked like he'd bitten into a lemon.

"Ma'am, with respect, you haven't done field work before. It's dangerous, and—"

"Which is exactly why I need to know first-hand what my people face. Eric, you're uncomfortable because normal hierarchy doesn't work this way. I understand. But I need to know what I'm asking of you, and the only way to learn that is to do it." She softened slightly. "I promise to follow orders and not get in the way. If I'm a liability, tell me and I'll reassign myself to Vanderbilt's team. But I need to try."

Eric was quiet a moment, then nodded. "Right then. Ma'am, you'll need field gear. Davies, take her to the armoury and get her kitted out. We leave in two hours."

---

Two hours later, Sophia was regretting every life choice that led to this moment. The body armour was heavy and hot. The rifle felt wrong in her hands despite Murphy's patient instruction in the carpark. The boots were breaking in her feet, not the other way around. 

"Why do I feel like this is a mistake, Mr Davies? It's completely logical but somehow I feel like I'm going to get one of you killed babysitting me."

"The mere fact that that worries you tells me you're doing the right thing. Don't worry ma'am, we've seen you in action and when you were told to get down you got down. You'd be surprised how many idiots stand up and babble instead."

So here she was, in the passenger seat of Eric's Triton, Davies and Murphy in the back with enough weaponry to start a small war. The morning sun blazed on the horizon as they drove into increasingly remote country.

"First site is Gundagai area," Eric said, eyes on the road. "Farm property, owner's been cooperative. Reported finding 'weird fluffy seeds' in his north paddock."

"How many?"

"Didn't count them. But if it's dandelions, even a dozen seeds means trouble."

They drove in silence for a while. Then Eric glanced at her.

"Ma'am, when we get there, you stay behind me and Davies. Murphy's got overwatch. You see anything hostile, you call it out but don't engage unless I tell you to. Understood?"

"Understood."

"And ma'am? Thanks for doing this. Most brass wouldn't."

"Most brass don't have to live with themselves if they send people into danger they don't understand."

---

The farm was weatherboard and corrugated iron, surrounded by eucalyptus and introduced pasture grasses. A man in his sixties met them at the gate, weathered and suspicious.

"You the government mob?"

"Eric Chen, Project Liaison's ground team. This is Ms. Hachia, Davies, and Murphy. You reported finding unusual seeds?"

"Yeah. Wife spotted 'em three days ago. Thought they were thistle at first, but they're not like anything we've seen. Showed one to the agricultural extension office, they said call you lot." He spat. "Don't want government mucking about on my land, but don't want alien plants either."

Eric's tone was carefully neutral. "Understood, sir. We'll confirm whether they're antithesis, deal with any we find, and be on our way. Shouldn't take more than an hour."

The farmer grunted and waved them through. "North paddock, past the dam. I'll wait here. Don't shoot my stock."

They walked in tactical formation, Eric leading, Sophia between him and Davies, Murphy trailing with his rifle at low ready. The paddock sloped down to a dam, then rose toward a tree line.

"There." Davies pointed. White tufts dotted the grass, maybe twenty of them visible.

"Spread out. Five meter spacing. Ma'am, you're on Davies. Don't wander off." Eric keyed his radio. "Autumn, you getting this from my bodycam?"

> _Confirmed. Those are dandelion seeds. Most look dormant but three are germinating. I'm marking them on your HUD._

Red circles appeared in Sophia's vision. She blinked, startled. The augs were one thing in the office, another thing entirely out here with hostile plants.

"Right. Standard clearance. Napalm splatterbombs on the germinating ones, flamethrower sweep for the rest." Eric moved forward carefully, Davies matching his pace, Sophia between them feeling distinctly useless.

They'd cleared ten seeds when Murphy's voice cracked across the radio. "Contact! Tree line, multiple hostiles!"

Sophia spun. Dog-weeds, a dozen of them, boiling out of the eucalyptus like a green tsunami.

"Fall back to the dam! Controlled retreat, covering fire!" Eric's voice was parade-ground sharp. 

The world became noise. Rifles cracked, brass tinkled on stones. She stumbled, Davies grabbed her arm, hauled her backwards.

"Stay behind the berm!" Davies shoved her down behind the dam's earthen wall. She landed hard, got her rifle up, tried to remember what Murphy taught her. Safety off. Sight picture. Breathe.

A dog-weed crested the dam wall. She fired. Missed. Fired again. It went down, but three more replaced it.

Eric and Murphy were methodical, each shot dropping a target. But there were too many, and they kept coming.

"Where the hell are they coming from?" Eric burned a magazine into a cluster of them, reloaded smoothly.

> _Hive under the tree line. It's producing them faster than you can kill them. I count twenty visible, estimated forty more in reserve._

"Fuck." Eric burned through another magazine. "Ma'am, I recommend we—"

"Abort. We abort now." Sophia's voice was steadier than she felt.

"Copy abort. But ma'am, we can't extract." Eric's tone was apologetic but firm. "They're between us and the vehicles. We can hold here, the dam gives us good defensive position, but we need escalation."

"Escalation?" Her mind was blanking.

"Vanguard support. Forest. This is beyond our capability, ma'am."

The words cut through her panic. Right. This was why they had protocols. This was why they had a pet Vanguard, something the law provided for and the system loathed; their disregard for teamwork and protocol was legend.

She fumbled for the thing on her belt, the "batphone" as Eric's team called it—an overpowered handheld radio that looked like it was built in the seventies if the seventies had alien technology. GPS, encrypted channel, and most importantly, a panic button.

Her thumb found the red button. She pressed it.

Three seconds of dead air, then: "Go for Forest."

"This is Hachia. Eric's team, Gundagai area, we're pinned down by antithesis hive, requesting Vanguard support."

"Roger. You have GPS lock, I have your position. Eric, put two of your recon drones on channel seven-three, Autumn needs eyes. I'm taking the Galya with two gunners for fast response and air support. Team Charlie will follow in the Triton and I will give them a heavy loadout — we'll do their equipment brief en route. Oleksiy's spinning up valley defense as precaution. Sit tight, I'm airborne in two."

Eric was already pulling drones from his pack, fingers flying across the controller. "Drones on seven-three, launching now."

Two small quadcopters whirred into the air, racing toward the tree line.

> _Got them. Hive is forty meters into the trees, Model Three producing dog-weeds every ninety seconds. You've got about sixty hostiles between you and extraction. I'm plotting firing solutions for the Galya._

In the background, Sophia heard turbines spooling up, then Forest's voice over what sounded like considerable wind noise: "Rotating now—hold on you two—collective up—and we're away!"

The Galya's takeoff sounded... enthusiastic. Murphy winced. "Forest flying?"

"Yeah." Eric didn't look up from the drone feed. "Oleksiy's better, but Forest gets there."

Sophia looked at Eric, who was burning through magazines at an unsustainable rate.

"Fifteen minutes."

"We can do fifteen minutes. Murphy! Conserve ammo, controlled bursts only. Davies, grenades on the tree line, see if we can discourage them."

The grenades made impressive bangs. The dog-weeds didn't care. In front of them Eric could have sworn the ground rippled, but by the time he had binocs out, there was nothing to see.

Ten minutes. Eric was down to his last magazine. Murphy called out he was dry, switched to pistol. Davies was burning through his reserve magazines.

Sophia's rifle clicked empty. She fumbled for a magazine, dropped it, picked it up with shaking hands.

"Easy, ma'am. Breathe. You're doing fine." Davies said it while methodically double-tapping dog-weeds. She reloaded, tried to remember to breathe.

The shriek of turbines split the sky. The Galya came in fast and not entirely level, flaring hard at the last second. The 30mm cannon made a sound like the world's angriest chainsaw, and the tree line exploded into splinters and ichor.

Three passes, each one a masterclass in aggressive flying if not exactly textbook technique. The cannon was thorough.

The Galya's landing was... vigorous. It bounced once, settled hard, and two gunners bailed out before the skids fully stopped rocking. They immediately took up positions with rifle-mounted launchers. The other passenger was rooting throught te storage. A box of ammunition sailed out and split when it hit the ground; a steel box is strong but lead is heavy. Clips spread on the ground beside it, and the morning was suddenly a whole lot less gut-wrenching.

Forest dropped from the pilot's seat, rifle in hand, and jogged over. Behind him, the Galya sat at a slight angle, like it was judging his landing. He looked disgustingly calm despite having flown like a man with a grudge against gravity.

"G'day. Team Charlie's fifteen minutes behind in the Triton — I took the fast option." He jerked a thumb at the two gunners. "Davies and Murphy — the other Davies and Murphy — have resonators if things get spicy again."

Eric, reloading with hands that barely shook, managed a laugh. "Appreciate the air support. How's Oleksiy feel about you flying his bird?"

Forest looked annoyed. "It's _not_ his bird." He stumped off.

"G'day. Heard you called for Vanguard support."

Eric, reloading with hands that barely shook, managed a laugh. "Yeah. Appreciate the lift."

"Autumn says there's a hive. I'll deal with it. You lot right to extract?"

"We're ambulatory." Eric looked at his team. "Anyone hit?"

Negatives all around. Sophia realized she was bleeding from a cut on her arm she didn't remember getting. It didn't seem important.

"Right then." Forest pulled something from his pack, a sphere the size of a softball. "You lot extract to your vehicles. You don't want to be close when this baby goes off."

He glanced at the two gunners. "Keep watch, anything moves that's green, light it up."

One of them grinned. "Sir, these resonators are brilliant."

"Fill out the paperwork if you want to keep them. And don't call me sir, I work for a living."

The Triton roared up in a cloud of dust, and four more figures piled out. These were definitely Team Charlie—Eric's people, moving with practiced efficiency. Forest jogged over to brief them while his two gunners maintained overwatch.

Forest grinned at Sophia. "How was your first field trip?"

"Terrifying."

"Good, you were paying attention. Eric, she do alright?"

"Followed orders, didn't panic, only shot at hostiles. She'll do."

Forest's grin widened. "High praise from Eric. Right, bugger off and let me work."

---

In the Triton, driving back to town, nobody spoke for a while. Then Davies started laughing. Murphy joined in. Eric was trying not to smile.

"What?" Sophia demanded.

"Ma'am, you just survived your first contact. You're one of us now." Davies was grinning. "Welcome to the shit."

"There's an initiation?"

"You passed it. Eric made you reload under fire. That's the test."

She looked at Eric, who shrugged. "You dropped the magazine. Had to see if you'd freeze or figure it out."

"I could have been killed!"

"We all could have. But you weren't. You picked it up, reloaded, and kept shooting. That's what matters."

She wanted to be angry. But she was too tired, and too weirdly proud. She'd done it. She'd survived.

"Same time next week, ma'am?" Murphy asked cheerfully.

"Shut up, Murphy."

Back at base, Sophia found Forest in the armoury with Team Charlie, supervising as they logged the Vanguard weapons.

"Resonators?" she asked.

"Class One anti-organic weapons. Vibration generators, very effective against targets with rigid cell-walls. Unpleasant for you, lethal for your garden. And antithesis, while are not strictly plants but have a few things in common with them. Point, pull trigger, dog-weed turns into soup." He gestured at the four rifles being carefully inventoried. "I bought them with discretionary project points. Team Charlie gets to keep them if they pass the safety certification."

"You're arming a government security team with alien weapons."

"I'm arming Eric's people with tools that will keep them alive. There's a difference." He looked at her. 

"Vanguard response was professional and effective. Team Charlie deployed with Vanguard weapons—resonators—and established effective overwatch. No casualties, mission objective achieved—seeds eliminated, hive neutralized. Recommend follow-up survey and recommend formal certification program for Vanguard weapon systems."

"I've already spoken to Forest about protocols. You'll be drafting them together with Autumn. I want your sign-off before anyone deploys those weapons again."

"Agreed. Ma'am, for the record, those resonators are significantly more effective than our standard weapons. If we're going to be doing hive clearance, they're force multipliers we can't afford to pass up."

"I know. I was there." She paused. "I also know what it means to arm government troops with alien technology. We need to be very careful about this."

"Understood, ma'am

She watched Team Charlie handle the weapons with the careful reverence of people who understood exactly what they held.

"We need protocols."

"Already working on them. Autumn's drafting certification requirements. Eric's input is required, obviously." He smiled. "This is your show administratively. I'm just the Wally footing the bill."

"And if I said no?"

"Then I'd respect your authority and we'd find another solution. But I don't think you'll say no. You've been in the field now. You know what they're facing."

Another knock. Forest stuck his head in.

"Quick word?"

"Come in."

He sat, looking uncharacteristically serious. "The response today — taking the Galya with gunners, Team Charlie following in the Triton — it worked, but it showed me gaps. The fast air support option is valuable, but I'm not Oleksiy. I got us there, but he'd have made it look easy. We need better coordination protocols."

"You're not flying the Galya again without supervision."

"I could say 'it's my fucking helicopter,' but you're probably right. Sophia, the resonators made the difference. Two gunners with Vanguard weapons providing suppressing fire from the air while Team Charlie swept on the ground — that's a force multiplier. Even when it's not enough to kill, it stuns them and slows them down. The usual version of that weapon is self-powered and it can't juice things up like that. The Gally has two thousand horsepower, it can run them all day with enough oomph for a sweep. And Autumn can integrate with your recon drones, that worked perfectly. We need dedicated training, not field improv."

"I'm listening."

"Team Charlie needs proper certification with Vanguard weapons. My gunners got the field-expedient version — which means they once saw Oleksiy use them, they understood the basics, and I gave them a reminder. But formal training, range time, doctrine — that takes time. And I need to know when to escalate valley defense. Today wasn't close to us, but Oleksiy spun everyone up just in case."

"You think there'll be more incidents like today."

"I'm bloody sure there will. The dandelion problem is bigger than we realized. I want your teams to do this, but not as a suicide mission. They need _real_ weapons, being evac'd is embarrassing."

She looked at the map. Sixteen more sites. How many would turn into hives?

"I'll talk to Vanderbilt about coordination protocols. You work with Eric on the weapons certification. And arrange training with Oleksiy for proper Galya operations—if you're going to be doing fast response, you need to not bounce the landing." She paused. "And Forest? Thank you. For responding, for the gunners, for Team Charlie, for all of it. Even if your flying gave them motion sickness."

"That's what Vanguards do. Protect people. And my flying isn't that bad."

"Eric said Oleksiy is 'smoother.'"

"Eric is a diplomat." He stood. "Oh, and Sophia? You did well today. The drone call, using the batphone _before_ it was a shitshow, trusting Eric's tactical decisions — that's the hard part. The shooting you'll get better at with practice."

After he left, she picked up the phone and dialed.

"Vanderbilt? It's Hachia. I'm assigning myself to your field verification team next week. Yes, field team. No, I know what I'm doing. Well, I'm learning anyway. Also, we need to discuss coordination protocols between ground teams and valley resources. Forest has concerns, and after today, so do I. Set up a meeting."

She hung up, looked at her hands. They'd stopped shaking. That seemed like progress.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Forest: _Hive was maturing, probably four days old. Good call on the batphone, probably saved lives. Team Charlie wants to name their resonators. I told them only after certification. Welcome to the valley._

Another message, from Eric: _Ma'am, for what it's worth: you're cleared for field work. Will requisition proper combat augs for you. Can't have the boss running around half-blind.

She was smiling.

---

The debrief was in Sophia's office, all four of them looking like they'd been dragged through a hedge backwards. Which, given the amount of vegetation in their gear, wasn't far off.

"Right." Sophia had showered, changed, treated the cut that turned out to be from a branch not a dog-weed, and resumed her administrative role. "After-action report. Eric?"

"Team performed according to training. Encountered larger force than expected, correctly called for escalation. No casualties, mission objective partially achieved—seeds eliminated, hive neutralized. Recommend follow-up survey of area to ensure no additional hives."

"Agreed. Davies, Murphy, anything to add?"

They shook their heads. Professional to the last.

"Right. You're dismissed. Get some rest. And thank you."

After they filed out, Eric lingered. "Ma'am, permission to speak freely?"

"Granted."

"You did well today. Better than most first-timers. And calling the abort when you did, then backing my tactical decision — that's the kind of combat lead my boys can trust. Not easy for brass to subordinate themselves."

"It was terrifying."

"It always is. That's why we train. But you didn't freeze, you didn't get anyone killed by confusing the chain of command. You trusted the training." He paused. "For what it's worth, I'm glad you came. Helps to know the boss understands what we're doing out there."

After he left, Sophia sat in her office, looking at the red dots on the map. Fifteen more sites to check. And now she knew what "check" meant.

She picked up the phone, dialed.

"Vanderbilt? It's Hachia. I'm assigning myself to your field verification team next week. Yes, field team. No, I know what I'm doing. Well, I'm learning anyway. Set it up."

She hung up, looked at her hands. They'd stopped shaking. That seemed like progress.

Her phone buzzed. A message from Forest: _Hive was mature. Good call on the batphone. Probably saved lives. Welcome to the valley._

She smiled. She wasn't sure what "welcome to the valley" meant, but she suspected she'd find out.

Sixteen more sites. She assigned herself to all of them. Fuck the paperwork.

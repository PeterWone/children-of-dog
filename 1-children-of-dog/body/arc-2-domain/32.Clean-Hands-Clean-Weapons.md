# Clean Hands, Clean Weapons

> "Men are from Mars, so we drink. Women are from Venus, which is more hospitable, so they're better adjusted."<br>
> &mdash; Eric Chow, Ground Team Commander

---

The convoy rumbled into the valley as the sun touched the western ridgeline. Three vehicles: Eric's truck, the armoured personnel carrier they'd borrowed from Forest's expanding arsenal, and Shorty's ute bringing up the rear. The convoy slowed as it passed Oleksiy's place, the old Slav waving from his porch where he sat cleaning what looked suspiciously like a Mosin-Nagant he absolutely shouldn't have. Eric waved back.

Ken leaned forward from the back seat. "Did we just wave at a war crime?"

"If we did, it happened before we got here," Eric said diplomatically. "Besides, have you _seen_ what that man can do with that rifle? The antis don't stand a chance."

"Fair point."

They pulled into the depot yard, a cleared space beside the research station that had evolved organically from "somewhere to park" into a sort of fairground. Someone, probably Forest, had laid gravel. Someone else, probably Oleksiy, had installed flood lights. The result was functional, well-lit, and utterly lacking in bureaucratic approval.

The men spilled out with the easy movements of people who'd done this dance before. Ground Team B had been operational for six months now, and the routine was ingrained: secure weapons, inventory ammunition, clean everything, *then* relax.

Eric opened the back of his truck where the squad weapons lived. "Alright, you know the drill. Everything gets broken down, cleaned, and inspected. Autumn will be watching."

> _I'm always watching._

A presence drone drifted past, projecting Autumn's lilac form in her characteristic cheeky schoolgirl outfit.

> _And judging. Mostly judging._

"Terrific," muttered Shorty, pulling out his rifle case. "An AI with a sense of humour."

"Could be worse," Ken said, setting his weapon on the cleaning bench. "Could be an AI with a clipboard and a compliance manual."

> _I heard that. And for your information, I _have_ a compliance manual. Forest made me promise never to read it._

Laughter rippled through the team as they set up their cleaning stations. Someone had installed proper weapon maintenance benches under a covered area—another one of those improvements that simply appeared when needed. Eric suspected Forest again, though it could have been Oleksiy. Those two had a habit of solving problems before anyone officially identified them as problems.

The work proceeded in comfortable silence punctuated by the occasional comment. Brushes scraped carbon from bolt carriers. Patches pushed through barrels. The smell of gun oil and solvent mingled with eucalyptus and dust.

"You know what's weird?" Doll Murchison said, running a bore snake through his barrel for the third time. "Three months ago I would have complained about doing this. Now it's... I don't know. Relaxing?"

"It's because nobody's yelling at you," Eric said, not looking up from his own rifle. "No rush, no paperwork, no deadline except 'before you put it away.' Makes a difference."

Tom Bradley, newest member of Ground Team B, paused in his cleaning. "Is it always like this? The mission, I mean. We went out, found the bastards, shot them, came back. No forms, no after-action review, no debrief with some officer who wasn't there."

"Sophia will want a report," Eric said. "I do them. But she'll actually read it, and she'll ask intelligent questions because she's been out with us."

"Huh." Tom went back to cleaning his weapon, looking thoughtful.

Across the depot, Ken had his rifle completely disassembled, each part laid out with geometric precision on a towel. He worked with the intensity of a man performing a sacred ritual. His son Scott had the same focus when he cleaned his .22 after practice at Oleksiy's range.

"Anyone else notice we don't count round out and then back in?" Shorty said. 

Shorty said slowly, "It's because the ammo's coming from a Vanguard, not requisitioned from a budget. There's a freedom in that."

"Not all of. The terrible two are always on my case to bring back the brass."

"Where do they get that much lead?"

"Car batteries."

"So _that's_ why the old bugger wants them. Live and learn."

The men fell silent, each considering this. The only sounds were the whisper of cleaning patches and the distant hum of research equipment from the station.

"My wife says it's like living in the sixties," Ken said eventually. "Back when people actually talked to their neighbours and helped each other without expecting payment."

"Your wife," Eric said carefully, "wasn't alive in the sixties."

"Neither was I. But she watches a lot of old shows. She says it's like that, except with better technology and not so much smoking."

"The Range Mothers have been talking," Tom offered. "My missus said they're planning something. Won't say what."

Multiple groans answered this. The Range Mothers planning something was rarely boring, frequently expensive in unforeseen ways, and almost always resulted in the men doing manual labour they hadn't anticipated.

"Last time they planned something," Shorty said darkly, "we ended up building that pavilion. In winter."

"You love that pavilion," Eric pointed out. "You drink there three times a week."

"I love it _now_. While we were building it in the freezing bloody cold, I had reservations."

> _The pavilion was Forest's idea. The Range Mothers simply ensured it happened._

"How is that different from planning?" demanded Shorty.

> _Planning implies consideration of alternatives. The Range Mothers decided, then made it inevitable. It's much more efficient._

"That's terrifying," Ken said.

> _Yes. I imagine the prospect of you lot approaching with all your toys is equally terrifying from the point of view of a Model Seventeen._

---

By the time they finished cleaning, the sun had properly set and the valley had transformed. Light spilled from windows. Smoke rose from chimneys. And down by Oleksiy's place, someone had set up the long table on the level ground outside the firing range.

Eric saw it first as they packed away the last of the cleaning gear. "Did we know about this?"

"The wives knew," Tom said. "Mine told me to 'come hungry.' I thought she meant dinner at home."

"The Range Mothers strike again," Shorty muttered, but he was grinning.

They walked down as a group, drawn by the smell of cooking meat and the sound of conversation. The long table was a masterwork of improvisation—actually two tables laid end to end, covered in mismatched tablecloths and surrounded by every chair the valley could muster. Braziers burned at strategic intervals, casting warm light and keeping the evening chill at bay. Gas heaters hummed their industrial lullaby. They were convenient but fewer each time; gas had to be bought it. They could afford it, but why? There was plenty of deadfall, and brazier.

Forest and Oleksiy manned a grill that looked like it had been welded together from repurposed steel drums. Both men wielded tongs with the confidence of artillery officers, which, Eric reflected, wasn't far off given their respective backgrounds.

"Gentlemen!" Forest called out. "Weapons cleaned and stored?"

"Yes sir," Eric said, falling into the old military rhythm without thinking.

"Outstanding. Grab a drink, the serious cooking won't be ready for an hour but there's snacks."

"Serious cooking" turned out to be an understatement. Sissi had apparently declared war on hunger itself. The table groaned under platters of spring rolls, satay skewers, som tam that made eyes water, and dishes Eric couldn't name but absolutely intended to try.

The women were already there, having claimed the best seats near the heaters. The Range Mothers occupied one end like a council of elders, though their ages varied from late twenties to sixty-something. What unified them was a certain knowing quality, like they'd seen this movie before and knew how it ended.

Eric found Sophia sitting with Trixie, both women cradling glasses of what smelled like Forest's notorious mead. He grabbed a beer from an ice chest—someone had driven to town earlier—and joined them.

"Successful hunt?" Sophia asked.

"Textbook. Small pack, no complications. Tom did well for his first real engagement."

"Good." She took a long drink. "Vanderbilt called while you were out. He wanted to know where we're getting our equipment."

"What did you tell him?"

"That we have access to advanced technology through our consulting Vanguard, and that all equipment is logged and accounted for." She smiled. "All true, and it told him absolutely nothing useful."

"He's going to keep pushing."

"Let him. What's he going to do, audit Forest?" She gestured at their host, who was deep in conversation with Oleksiy about something that required elaborate hand gestures and occasional laughter. "That's a battle nobody wins."

Trixie leaned in, lowering her voice. "The Range Mothers are plotting."

"We heard," Eric said. "Any idea what?"

"No, but whatever it is, they're very pleased with themselves. Rebecca mentioned something about 'cultural preservation' and 'essential skills transfer' but she got all cagey when I asked for details."

Down the table, Ken was explaining something to his son Scott, who had been allowed to join the adults for the evening. The boy listened with the intensity of youth learning from a father he respected. 

Nearby, Shorty's wife Sheila held court with a group of women near one of the braziers, all of them laughing at something. As Eric watched, Maria Santos arrived with a casserole dish, and the conversation's volume dropped conspiratorially. He caught fragments:

"—back on his feet in three days—"

"—standing at attention, if you know what I mean—"

More laughter, and Sheila's voice, mock-scandalized: "Maria! The children might hear!"

"The children are all the way over there, and besides, they should learn that nanite treatment has... comprehensive benefits."

"Your poor husband," one of the other women said, grinning. "Does he know you tell us these things?"

"OK, so I'm a pervert. I'm a very _happy_ pervert! Very _satisfied_ with the state of things."

The women dissolved into giggles, and Eric decided he'd heard quite enough, thank you. He turned back to Sophia and Trixie, both of whom were trying very hard not to laugh.

"You know what I just realized?" Sophia said, determinedly changing the subject. "We're having a barbecue."

Eric looked around—the food, the drinks, the people talking and laughing in the firelight. "Yes?"

"When's the last time you went to a barbecue that wasn't a work function or a family obligation? Where you actually wanted to be there?"

Eric thought about this. "Before I joined the service. Maybe fifteen years?"

"Exactly. And look at this." She gestured at the gathering. "No name tags, no networking, no pecking order. People are here because they want to be here, talking to people they actually like."

He roared with laughter. "There most certainly _is_ a pecking order. It's just not official and it changes a lot. _You_ don't see it, your majesty, because of where you are _in_ it. But nobody minds. I have seen you use more ordinance in two minutes than the entire team does in an hour. And everyone was glad you did. Even if our ears were ringing."

"The food helps," Trixie pointed out, stealing a spring roll from a passing platter.

"The food is magnificent," Sophia agreed. "But that's not the point. The point is this shouldn't exist. We're too busy, too stressed, too distributed. Modern life doesn't permit this kind of spontaneous community gathering."

"We're not _in_ modern life," Eric said slowly. "We live on Planet Forest, in a weird fairytale run by an alien AI with a sense of humour and a theatrical bent."

"What are the spring rolls made from? I didn't know we had a flour replacement."

"Rice. Priya was using one of the ponds to regulate the temperature for one of her endless habitat experiments and her dad planted rice in the warm water."

They sat with that thought, munching on the rolls, while around them the barbecue continued its cheerful defiance of contemporary social atomization.

---

An hour later, the "serious cooking" was declared ready. Forest and Oleksiy carried over what looked like half a pig, fragrant with smoke and spices, setting it on a massive wooden board. Carving commenced with speed and precision, steaming trenchers filled and passed.

People lined up without being told, plates were filled, and somehow everyone got fed without any formal organization. It just... happened. Eric noted this with the part of his mind that never stopped being a tactical officer. In any normal setting this would have required a buffet line, or a serving system, or someone taking charge. Here, people just helped each other and it worked.

He found himself seated between Tom Bradley and one of the researchers, a materials scientist named Janet whose husband worked in the fabrication shop. The conversation flowed naturally.

"How long have you been here?" Tom asked Janet.

"Two years. We came for a six-month research contract, took one look at the valley, and never left."

"But your career—"

"Is here," Janet said firmly. "I'm doing more interesting work than I ever did at the university, with better resources, no grant applications, and no department politics. Why would I leave?"

"Money?" Tom suggested.

Janet laughed. "What money? I mean yes, technically we get paid. The research grants flow through normal channels. But I haven't spent any of it in six months. There's nothing to spend it on here, and I don't want anything from out there."

Eric leaned forward. "Nothing at all? How does that work? Everyone needs money."

"Do we?" Janet gestured at the table around them. "This meal cost nothing. Oh, the food cost money, someone drove to town and bought supplies. But nobody's counting contributions or tracking debts. Forest provided the venue and probably half the ingredients. Sissi did most of the cooking. The Range Mothers organized. Oleksiy provided the grill and his expertise. Everyone contributed something."

"But that's just a barbecue," Tom said. "What about the big things? Housing, healthcare, equipment?"

"Forest handles the fancy bits," Janet said with a shrug. "Advanced tech, medical gear, stuff we can't make. But housing? We cut and mill our own timber. The teams treat construction like a mildly competitive game—who can raise a frame faster, whose joints are tighter. Healthcare's mostly nanites and Autumn's diagnostics. The rest of us handle everything else through... I don't know what to call it. Mutual aid? Community support? Old-fashioned neighbourliness?"

"Communism," offered Eric's kinda-sorta partner Sarah, who'd been listening from across the table. "Except voluntary, small-scale, and instead of razorwire and machine guns we stop people from leaving by feeding them till they can't move."

This triggered the predictable debate. Rebecca, the recent arrival from Brisbane, immediately bristled. "That's not funny. My grandfather—"

"Fled tyranny," Sarah finished. "We know, Rebecca, you've told us. But what your grandfather fled was large-scale coercive redistribution enforced by state violence. This is sharing. With your neighbours. Who you know. Who you see every day. Who your children play with."

"There's no difference!"

"There's every difference," Sheila interjected, setting down her glass with a solid thunk. "The Stalinists took from strangers and gave to strangers and kept most of it for themselves because that's what bureaucracies do. We share with family—and yes, Rebecca, we're all family here—because that's what families do."

"The scale matters," added Maria Santos, Tom's wife. "At family scale, it's called love. At valley scale, it's called community. At nation scale, it's called policy and that's when it goes wrong because policy requires enforcement and enforcement requires force. It's also about complexity. Big systems have overheads and delays. The bigger they are the worse it gets. We don't have that. If you ask Forest, and I suggest you don't unless you have all afternoon, he'll tell you that scale and money are the foundation of everything that's wrong with the modern world, and those two things are what has killed every civilisation ever."

This was a bit much for a beer at a barbecue so they just filed it and moved on.

"But what happens when someone takes advantage?" Rebecca pressed. "When someone just... takes without giving back?"

The Range Mothers, who had been listening to this debate with ill-concealed amusement, exchanged significant looks. It was Sheila who answered.

"Same thing that happens in any family. Disappointed looks at dinner. Conversations about expectations. Social consequences. The key word is 'someone.' Not some anonymous person in a distant city, but someone. A person. With a name and a face and a reputation."

"Plus," added Janet, "being a freeloader is too much work when you see your neighbours every day. Much easier to just contribute something."

Eric found himself nodding. He thought about the weapons cleaning earlier — no regulations required it, no supervisor checked their work, but everyone had done it properly because that's what you did. The weapons were communal property in a sense, used by whoever needed them, maintained by everyone who used them. It worked because everyone involved understood the consequences of failure. The tragedy of the commons was held at bay by the imminence of consequence.

Down the table, Ken was describing the mission to Scott, carefully editing out the graphic details but conveying the importance of preparation and teamwork. Other children listened too, and Eric noticed none of the parents interfered or redirected the conversation. Their kids would grow up understanding that the world was dangerous, that preparation mattered, that working together meant surviving together.

Strange values for modern suburban children, he thought. Perfectly normal values for most of human history.

---

As the evening deepened and the braziers burned down to glowing coals, the conversation fragmented into smaller groups. Eric found himself with Shorty and Ken near one of the heaters, drinks in hand, watching the valley settle into night.

"You know what's weird?" Shorty said. "We've been here two years and I just realized I don't know what anything costs anymore."

"The groceries cost money," Ken said. "Someone drove to town—"

"Not all of them, quite a bit grew here. But I mean, what's the price of having Forest fix something?"

"A high risk that he will borrow your stuff, leave it in the yard, and forget where he left it." Trixie was looking sourly at Forest who was carefully ignoring it. 

"He's just like that. Probably it's a Vanguard thing, they requisition things from nowhere, use them and drop them because they're generally pretty busy dealing."

"Oh well, that's alright then. It also explains the thirty years before that: he was training to be a Vanguard," she wasn't letting him off the hook.

"What does it cost to ask Oleksiy for advice? What do we pay Autumn for tactical support?"

"Nothing," Eric said. "Because they're not selling services, they're solving problems."

"That's what I mean!" Shorty was getting animated the way he did after a few drinks. "Everything out there—" he gestured vaguely toward the world beyond the valley, "—has a price tag. Everything is a transaction. But here, nothing is a transaction and somehow everything still works. Better than it worked before, actually."

Tom wandered over with a fresh beer, catching the tail end. "You talking about money again? Maria won't shut up about it. Says she hasn't opened her wallet in weeks except to go to town."

"Same," Ken said. "Sheila was laughing about it yesterday. Said the only thing she buys anymore is stuff we can't make or grow ourselves. Everything else just... happens."

"That's not quite right though," Eric said slowly. "Things don't just happen. We make them happen. Forest fixed your solar panel last month, Ken. You helped Oleksiy with his fence the week before. Tom, you've been teaching half the valley how to maintain the water pumps."

"Yeah, but nobody's keeping score," Tom said. "That's what's different."

"Nobody needs to," Shorty said. "We all see each other every day. We just do what needs doing. If we _don't_ service the vehicles and clean the weapons and refill the magazines, whose problem is that? Ours. Ken here might be a two-pot screamer and a huge fishing dork&mdash;" he dodged a friendly swipe, "but if he jams in action it's _my_ problem so I check his gear, and he checks mine."

Ken snorted and went back to the fence. "Try that in Brisbane. Your neighbour doesn't even know your name, let alone give a shit if your fence falls down."

"Neighbour in Sydney," Tom said darkly, "tried to sell me solar panels. Knew I already had them, he could see them on my bloody roof. Didn't care. Just had a script and a commission structure."

"Real estate agents are worse," Shorty said with feeling. "Sheila and I looked at buying a place before we came here. Agent told us it was a 'motivated seller' and we should offer quick. Found out later the bastard represented both sides and pocketed double commission while lying to both of us."

"Used car salesmen," Ken offered, and they all groaned in unison.

"Had one tell me a car had one owner," Eric said. "Bought it, found service records in the glovebox. Four previous owners. When I confronted him, he said 'well, only one owner that mattered.' What does that even mean?"

"Means he's a lying sack of shit," Tom said. "But he got his commission, so why would he care?"

"That's the problem, isn't it," Eric said thoughtfully. "Out there, people sell you things you don't need with money you don't have to impress people you don't like. And everyone's just... okay with that. Expected, even."

"Remember those ads for hamburgers?" Shorty said. "Model biting into this perfect burger, sauce dripping just so. You go to the actual restaurant, it's a sad flat thing that tastes like cardboard."

"Everything's like that," Ken said. "The picture on the box never matches what's inside. The promises in the brochure don't match the product. The job description doesn't match the actual work."

Forest had drifted over, drawn by the animated conversation. He listened for a moment, then settled into a vacant chair with his own drink.

"The point of money," said Forest in a quiet voice, "is not trade. It is to decouple benefit from consequence."

They all turned to look at him.

"When we helped Tom raise his shed, we all saw the result. He comes over and helps us with the loadout, because he. Benefit and consequence are right there, immediate, personal. Money means I can benefit from your work without ever meeting you. It does make trade easier, that's a benefit. But separating the benefit from the consequence breaks the decency chain."

"The solar panel guy," Tom said slowly. "He got his commission whether the panels worked or not. Whether I could afford them or not. He got paid, I got debt, and he never had to see the consequences."

"Real estate agent never had to live in the overpriced house he sold us," Shorty added. "Never had to watch us struggle with the mortgage."

"And none of them," Eric said, following the thread, "ever had to face us at a barbecue like this. Never had to look us in the eye and know what they'd done."

"Exactly," Forest said. "Here, if I make shit decisions, I have to live with them. With you. Face to face. Money lets people avoid that. Extract value and walk away clean."

Ken was nodding. "That's why everything out there is about selling. Not making, not building, not helping—selling. Because selling is the bit where you get the money and leave before the consequences catch up."

"Can't do that here," Tom observed. "If I half-arse something, everyone knows. And I have to see them the next day, and the day after that."

"But it's not just fear of shame," Eric said, working through it. "It's... I actually want to do good work because you're all real to me. You're not customers or marks or targets, you're Ken and Shorty and Tom. Your kids play with my kids. Your wives are friends with my wife. The work I do for you matters because you matter."

"Out there," Shorty said quietly, "nobody matters. They're all just... opportunities. Prospects. Demographics. The hamburger ad isn't trying to feed you, it's trying to extract money from you. The solar panel guy isn't trying to help you, he's trying to hit quota. Everything is about getting your money and moving to the next mark before you realize you've been had."

"Even the honest ones," Tom said. "Even when they're not lying, they're still trying to convince you to buy things you don't need. Upgrade your phone every year. New car every three years. Bigger house, fancier watch, trendy clothes. There's always someone telling you what you have isn't good enough."

"Growth," said Ken, with a look of revelation on his face, "Oh oh we need more houses therefore we need more everything, the economy is better. Let's bring in lots of immigrants to help build them, and not think about then you have to feed them, _house_ them and drive next to them."

"I've seen _you_ drive, that's pretty funny," said Shorty with a cheeky grin.

"Har har," said Ken, with grace no-one would have imagined six months ago, "I'm not talking about their driving, I'm talking about more people on the same road. Traffic jams, fuel, smog, more vehicle wear, all that shit."

"But back on the consumerism thing," Ken said wonderingly. "it makes you feel like a failure. Always felt like I was behind, like I wasn't keeping up. Letting my wife and my boy down."

"Are you?" Eric asked. "Happy?"

Ken looked around—at his son visible in the distance, laughing with friends. At his wife in animated conversation with the Range Mothers. At his mates beside him, and the valley stretching away into the darkness.

"Yeah," he said. "I am. And I don't understand why. I have less stuff. Less money. Smaller house. Older car. By every measure I used to use, I'm worse off. But I'm happier than I've been in twenty years."

"You have more of what matters," Forest said. "Friends you can count on. Work that means something. People who know your name and give a damn whether you're okay."

"Actually that's not true," interjected Ken, "I mean the measure of success thing. Smaller house, but holy shit you should see our bank balance! We're still getting paid but we aren't using the money."

"You're not the only one. It's fuckin' ironic," Eric said suddenly, "Now that we have no use for it we've got money coming out our ears. Dunno bout you but I wouldn't swap it for quids." He realised what he'd just said and chuffed.

"That's part of it. When we're out there hunting antis, we depend on each other. Really depend. You blokes mess up, I might die. That's not abstract, it's immediate and personal."

"You won't die, you old bastard," Shorty said. "You'll just get stuffed full of nanites for a couple of days."

"Like your wife."

"Like Maria," agreed Shorty, with a big shit-eating grin.

"And when you come back from the field," Tom said slowly, "the team thing doesn't go away. I'm not going to half-arse Oleksiy's water pump maintenance&mdash;"

"Because he'd kill you?"

"No, smartarse. Because he's my mate and he had my back last week when that Model Six charged us. Ken's not going to sell me a dodgy car because Ken's life depends on my rifle working properly."

"We're bound together," Eric said. "By necessity, but also by choice. And because we see the consequences of our actions—immediate, personal consequences—we act differently."

"We act like we give a damn," Ken said. "Because we do."

They sat with that for a while, watching the fire and the people around it. 

"So that's what money does," Shorty said eventually. "Lets you stop giving a damn. Lets you extract and leave. Benefit without consequence."

"Explains the marketers," Tom said. "They've perfected the art of extraction. Convince you to buy, take the money, disappear before you realize the burger doesn't match the picture."

"And everyone out there," Ken said, "is either a marketer or a mark. Either you're selling or you're being sold to. Either you're extracting value or having it extracted from you."

"Can't even tell which is which anymore," Shorty added. "Half the time you're both—getting screwed by someone upstream while screwing someone downstream. Everyone taking a cut, nobody taking responsibility."

"Whereas here," Eric said, "benefit and consequence are coupled. You help me, you see me helped. You screw me, you see me screwed. And you have to live with that. With me. Tomorrow and the day after and the day after that."

"Makes you act different," Tom said. "Makes you want to do right by people, because they're people. Real people. Not demographics or targets or opportunities."

Forest raised his glass. "To living with consequences."

"And giving a damn," Ken added.

They drank to that, and the conversation wandered to other things — technical details of the hunt, speculation about what the Range Mothers were plotting, friendly arguments about the best way to maintain different weapons. But the thread remained, woven through everything: they were bound together, and that binding made them different. Made them better. Made them whole.

Across the gathering, Sophia watched this group with calculating eyes. Vanderbilt would want to know why the valley worked when it shouldn't. She could write a report about economic efficiency and resource allocation and communal labor organization. She could quantify the value flows and model the decision structures.

But she knew that would miss the point. The valley worked because money didn't. Because benefit and consequence were coupled. Because people had to face each other, day after day, and that changed everything.

Somewhere in the darkness, Autumn's bees watched in four spectra. Deeper still, the antithesis compound quietly converted captured terror into the strength of knowledge. The valley dreamed its strange dream of mutual reliance and immediate consequence, and inside that dream, persons turned back into people.

The barbecue would run late into the night, as these things did. Tomorrow they'd be back to work — the researchers pursuing their studies, the ground team training and maintaining equipment, the families managing the endless tasks of daily life. But tonight, they were just people, eating and drinking and talking in the warmth of a fire, understanding at last the source of their contentment.

"You know what I don't miss?" Ken said eventually. "Ads. Haven't seen an ad in months. Nobody trying to sell me anything, convince me I need something, make me feel inadequate for not having the latest thing."

"The endless bombardment," Shorty said with a hint of bitterness. "TV, radio, internet, billboards, bus stops. Shiny happy people with all the toys, telling us with their smiles that we're not good enough, don't have enough, we're out of style and we better hurry up and buy if we want to join the cool kids."

"What's the matter with the car I'm drivin', are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?" sang Tom, echoing Billy Joel from long ago.

"Can't fall behind here," Eric said. "Behind what? Behind who? Everyone has what they need. Nobody's keeping score."

"It'd be alright if they made anything properly, but it's all crap that falls apart before the shine rubs off."

"To impress people who don't care," Shorty finished. "Because they're too busy trying to impress you with their own stuff. Glass baubles for the gullible natives."

"Exhausting," Tom said. "And a total waste of time. I never even noticed 'til it stopped."

"It's a fucking hamster wheel, that's what it is," spat Ken, "And we're the hamsters, turning the wheels of industry to make fatcats richer. _Were_ the hamsters, but the cage door is open. We're gone and I am _not_ going back."

They raised their glasses one more time, to freedom from the tyranny of keeping up, and to the strange new world they were building one barbecue at a time, whether the wider world approved or not.

No one had seen Forest in three days.

Trixie mentioned it first, her voice carefully neutral as she served breakfast in the longhouse. "Anyone heard from the old git?"

Silence answered. Not the alarmed kind—valley residents had learned to distinguish between concerning absence and tactical withdrawal. Forest disappeared sometimes. Usually returned with intelligence about hive movements or new defensive positions or occasionally just because he'd needed solitude and didn't feel like explaining himself.

Three days wasn't unprecedented. But three days during threat escalation was.

"Autumn?" Janna asked the air, because the AI monitored everything.

Autumn took longer than usual to respond. When her voice finally came through the speakers, the sarcasm was absent.

> _Forest's last known position was grid reference 3847-2214, approximately seventy kilometers southwest. Biometric telemetry ceased forty-seven hours ago. I have no data suggesting he's alive._

"You have no data suggesting he's dead either," Oleksiy observed, his Ukrainian pragmatism cutting through sentiment. "Biometric failure could mean jamming, equipment damage, deliberate deactivation."

> _All accurate. Also: catastrophic injury, capture, consumption, or death. I'm listing possibilities, not conclusions._

Perhaps forty people filled the longhouse—valley residents, scientists who'd become residents, the handful of outsiders who'd stayed long enough to understand what this place was. They processed Autumn's announcement with the practiced calm of people who'd learned that panic solved nothing.

Marcus Chen broke the silence. "Do we search for him?"

"Where?" Trixie's question was practical, not dismissive. "Seventy klicks southwest covers a lot of bush. If Forest doesn't want to be found, we won't find him. If he's in trouble, we're more likely to stumble into whatever troubled him."

"So we do nothing?" Chen's academic instinct rebelled against passive acceptance.

"We do what he trained us to do." Janna's voice carried certainty. "Maintain perimeter, monitor threats, coordinate response. Same as always. Forest isn't the valley—he's one bloke who happens to be very good at not dying. We're still here. The valley's still here. The antithesis don't care if our best gun is missing."

Oleksiy nodded slowly. "Defense preparation continues. Infrastructure hardening continues. If Forest returns, good. If not..." He gestured at the assembled residents. "We are not helpless."

The Macintyre boys exchanged glances, some wordless sibling communication passing between them. The younger one—Jack—spoke carefully. "Forest spent five years teaching us to be competent without him. Maybe that was the point."

---

The suggestion hung in the air for three days, growing heavier with Forest's continued absence. Valley residents maintained routines with determined normalcy: patrols, training, communal meals, research that had become survival preparation rather than academic exercise. But the question festered beneath surface competence.

Trixie finally voiced it over dinner, her usual hospitality roughened by exhaustion. "Did he bugger off deliberately?"

"Define deliberately." Dr. Kellerman's xenobiology expertise hadn't prepared her for this particular specimen of human behavior.

"Did Forest decide we needed to lose him?" Trixie set down her serving spoon with unusual force. "Look at us. We're maintaining everything he set up. Nobody's panicking, nobody's waiting for rescue, nobody's abandoning the valley. We're doing exactly what he trained us to do. What if that was the point? What if he saw his own presence as the last thing binding us to old patterns?"

Morrison, the materials scientist, processed this with characteristic thoroughness. "You're suggesting he withdrew strategically. Removing himself as authority figure to force our autonomy."

"I'm suggesting he's manipulative enough to die if he thought it would free us." Trixie's voice cracked slightly. "The bastard spent five years preparing us, then removed the one thing we couldn't prepare for—himself. Probably thinks he's being noble."

Janna shook her head. "Or he's lying dead in a ravine somewhere because the antithesis finally got lucky. We're ascribing strategy to what might just be bad fortune."

"Are we?" Chen leaned forward. "Forest made everything strategic. Recruited scientists for research that became weapons development. Trained civilians in 'survival skills' that made us paramilitary. Built this whole bloody valley into something that could survive without him. If he's gone, maybe he planned it from the start."

> _I have data on this._ Autumn's voice interrupted, unusually hesitant. _Forest and I discussed... contingencies. He was aware of behavioral patterns he termed 'the Odin problem.' The concern that his preparation of successors was itself a form of binding. That you would remain loyal to his vision rather than developing your own._

"So he did plan to disappear." Oleksiy's statement held no surprise.

> _He planned for the possibility that his removal might be necessary. I don't know if he chose to enact that plan. His last communication was tactical data about hive movements, nothing suggesting intentional withdrawal. But he was aware of the option._

"The aristocratic wanker." Trixie wiped her eyes angrily. "Using aristocratic methods for anarchist ends. Manipulating us even in his absence. We can't ask if he chose this, which means we can't know if we're still following his bloody plan."

---

The question consumed the longhouse discussions for days. Not paralyzed them—valley operations continued with increasing competence—but gnawed at the edges of certainty. Were they demonstrating Forest's successful training or their own genuine autonomy? If his absence was strategic, did their continued defense prove his manipulation or their freedom? Could they ever know?

Jack Macintyre raised his beer in the longhouse, his young voice carrying unexpected weight. "I've been thinking about Bonzer."

The table quieted. Forest's dog still haunted valley culture, his death marking a shift in how residents understood protection and choice.

"Bonzer wasn't loyal," Jack continued. "Not in the obedience sense. Forest told us once—the dog loved his sister, was loyal to his mum, and obeyed Forest because it was safe to be cheeky with him. When the Model Twelve came, Bonzer didn't die obeying commands. He died defending HIS territory because HE chose to. Forest was third in his priorities."

"Not seeing the relevance," Chen admitted.

"We're not Odin's hounds." Jack set down his beer with deliberate precision. "We're not einherjar who Valhalla binds, waiting for the All-Father to command us into Ragnarök. We're children of Dog. Bonzer's heirs. Forest didn't own his loyalty and he doesn't own ours. This is OUR valley. These are OUR people. We stand because we choose to, not because Forest commanded it."

Silence held for a long moment.

"Bugger me," Trixie said quietly. "The kid's right."

Janna nodded slowly. "If Forest removed himself to free us from his influence, then the only way to prove we're actually free is to not care why he left. His motives become irrelevant the moment we choose our own reasons."

"So we're defending the valley regardless of whether he's dead, hiding, or making some grand philosophical statement about authority." Morrison smiled slightly. "That's delightfully anarchist. Our motivation becomes completely independent of his intentions."

> _He'd gloat insufferably about this,_ Autumn observed. _Which means either his plan worked perfectly or you've genuinely transcended his manipulation. I can't tell which. Neither could he, which might have been his point._

Oleksiy stood, his massive frame drawing attention without demanding it. "Does it matter? The antithesis are coming. They don't care about our philosophy or Forest's motives. We have capabilities, training, weapons, and will. We have people worth protecting. We have choice to make them or not." He shrugged. "I choose to stay. Anyone who chooses otherwise, no judgment."

No one moved toward the door.

"Children of Dog," Jack repeated, testing the phrase. "I like that. Better than einherjar anyway—those poor bastards knew they'd lose at Ragnarök but fought anyway because Odin commanded. We might lose too, but it'll be our bloody choice."

"The old git would hate that we're making this about him." Trixie began collecting dishes with renewed energy. "So let's stop. Valley meeting tomorrow, zero-eight-hundred. We coordinate defense not because Forest trained us but because we're competent adults who prefer not dying. Bring your own tactical assessments. No waiting for orders from absent Vanguards."

The Macintyre boys grinned at each other. Chen nodded with academic satisfaction at philosophical problems resolving into practical action. Kellerman and Morrison exchanged glances that spoke to their transformation from visiting scientists to resident defenders.

Janna raised her glass. "To Bonzer. Who taught us that love and loyalty aren't the same as obedience, and that the best protection comes from those who choose it freely."

"To Bonzer," the longhouse echoed.

Oleksiy added quietly, "And to Forest, wherever the difficult man is. If his absence freed us, then perhaps even his manipulation served its purpose. If he's dead, then he died knowing we would stand without him. Either way, he's irrelevant now. We are children of Dog."

> _I'm not crying,_ Autumn announced. _AIs don't cry. This is a cooling system malfunction. Shut up._

---

Forty-some people gathered in the longhouse with maps, sensor data and threat assessments. They did not stand on ceremony.

The logistics report noted Forest's absence. It mattered less than it might. Defensive positions were long established. Doctrine was their own child, considered but never binding. They debated, discussed, and agreed to disagree in constructive, mutually supportive ways.

Sophia sat at the edge of the gathering, listening without commanding. She'd brought the Galya and her orbital strike capability, gifts freely offered to defenders who needed no orders. She who had once wielded authority no longer needed it. As they fought beside her on the frantic scramble to the heights required to threaten a nation, so she stood beside them now: it was her home too.

Today's problem was the Model Twenty-Three signatures appearing on southern approaches and the need to coordinate forty volunteers. The children of dog went to war on their own terms and for their own reasons.

Forest might have made a lesson of it. He had no more say, the well of his absurd luck finally run dry. But if the shade of him watched from the shadows its heart might have swelled to see how little they needed him. They girded themselves and did not flinch to meet a foe that had already felled the mighty. In the distance the rotors of a warming Galya beat the drums of war, each one answering the paradox of duty  with the courage of free men.

Trixie watched from the doorway, her hospitality now extending to ensuring warriors ate properly before operations. She watched their wordless prowling, wondering about a dog she never knew who changed everything. Loyal, faithful but never servile. Would anyone ever live up to the standard set by that dog? It made her laugh.

Autumn's drone ghosted past, tactical overlays streaming to defenders' displays.

The longhouse doors hung wide, the welcoming stronghold a reification of _why_. Split across the doors, carved into the timber inside and out, two metres tall, a hound rampant stood on a book trampling a broken crown, in one hand a sheaf of wheat, in the other a severed head, a rose between its teeth.

In the bush, the antithesis advanced with alien hunger, indifferent to human philosophy. In the valley people prepared, indifferent to absent authority. The children of dog would stand and fight their own battles.

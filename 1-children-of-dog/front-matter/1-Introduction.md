# Introduction

In the world of _Stray Cat Strut_ a chosen few bond with alien AIs to fight plant-like monsters called the Antithesis, a galactic weed that eats everything and is disturbingly adaptive. Most tales of the SCS universe unfold in fortified cities of the northern hemisphere, but this one takes place in the Great Dividing Range of eastern Australia. 

Australia's unique ecology changes everything. Millions of years of nutrient-poor soils filled Australian flora and fauna with brutal resilience. The same scarcity weakens the Antithesis. They struggle to establish in an environment so fundamentally different from their usual conquests. Some of the trees are filled with silica, living stone. Animals are filled with poison. Mostly their fangs, but sometimes their flesh. All of them are filled with murder; the cuter they are, the more you should worry. 

The muted antithesis threat left Australia's government largely intact, creating a different kind of dystopia. In a land that already resembled something from Judge Dredd — vast and deadly wastelands punctuated by crowded cities — ubiquitous surveillance and state control found fertile ground. The internet brought not just connection, but constant monitoring. Cities became luxury prisons, and being broke and homeless was always a crime.

But some choose another path, far from cameras and crowds.

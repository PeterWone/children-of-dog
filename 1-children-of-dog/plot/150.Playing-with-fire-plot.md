# Playing with fire - Plot Summary

## Key Events

- **Dr. Chen nearly killed** by captive hive specimen (opportunistic desperation)
- Dogweed erupts faster than Autumn can warn
- Forest throws large Flesh Melter into its mouth mid-leap
- Detonates inside, dissolves in mid-air
- Chen vomits in helmet from shock
- New protocol: 20m exclusion zone, armed escort, no exceptions
- Scientists adapt: "controlled" = "probably won't kill anyone today"
- Forest's weapon routine: MIL (Mother-In-Law) shoulder-launched rocket
- Autumn: "I do not imagine Microsoft paid Sweden for Mjolnir"
- Forest: "Difference is, I'm still here and they can sue me"
- Morrison's team films incendiary munitions with sensors
- Thermal data reveals quantum coherence disruption
- "Burn, baby, burn!" - Forest ruins gravitas with infectious humor
- Pattern: minor incursions provide observation opportunities
- Kellerman: "They're learning. Or evolving behaviors approximating learning"
- Eventually something will succeed through iteration
- Training becomes community events, Trix provides food
- Chen adept at improvised weapons, Morrison treats weapons as engineering
- **Thompson** (corporate) recognizes defensive capability being built
- **Sophia's second visit** during live incursion
- Observes coordinated response: Chen spots, Macintyres secure perimeter, Morrison sensors
- Detection to sanitization: 11 minutes, zero casualties
- Sophia: "This operation exceeded expectations for civilian response"
- Janna: "We live here. Seems reasonable to be competent at not dying"
- Sophia asks if replicable, Forest: competence yes, but care can't be regulated
- Valley evolved: scientists now residents defending home
- Autumn: unprecedented integration of civilian and defense operations
- Theme: Valley becoming hybrid - lab and fortress, research and killing ground

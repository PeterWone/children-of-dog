# Woodland - Plot Summary

## Chapter Overview
Forest's first encounter with the Antithesis invasion and his transformation into a Vanguard.

## Key Events

### The Attack
- Forest is clearing timber in the valley when Antithesis (dog-like Model Three) attacks
- Overwhelmed, he fights with improvised weapons (rock, machete) while sustaining serious injuries:
  - Forearm pierced by alien jaws, teeth embedded in bone
  - Leg shredded through work chaps
  - Chunk taken from his backside by "murderpigeon" (smaller model)
- Bleeding out under dead alien, vision narrowing, expecting to die

### Vanguard Initialization
- White-hot pain drives into base of skull - system initialization
- Green HUD text appears announcing he's become a Vanguard
- AI companion Myxoma interrupts formal ceremony, prioritizes survival
- Forest near death from blood loss and shock
- Myxoma uses his 130 initialization points to unlock Class I Medical Utilities
- Purchases WoundStop trauma sealant (5 points) to stabilize him

### Trix's Intervention
- Wife emerges from caravan with first aid supplies
- Her rage at his "I'm fine" claim while pinned under alien
- Uses machete to pry alien jaws open, freeing his arm
- Applies WoundStop to multiple wounds
- Skeptical of Forest's claims about voice in head, aliens, "space jam"
- Practical response: get weapons, check on neighbor Brian

### First Purchases
- Forest authorizes Hummingbird Mark I-D micro-missile launchers (x2, 10 points total)
- Weapons materialize "out of thin air" - plastic fantastic design
- Trix witnesses impossible technology, questions reality

### Brian's Rescue
- Drive to neighbor Brian's property (80-year-old farmer with partner)
- Kill Model Three en route with Troopie's bullbar
- Find Brian and partner barricaded in woodshed, defending with axe
- Clear roaming Antithesis with Hummingbird
- Leave Brian armed, provide anti-Seven pills against parasite exposure
- Myxoma warns about Model Seven (leech-like parasites)
- Verifies medication safe despite Brian's heart condition

**Myxoma (AI Companion)**
- Female voice, sarcastic, practical
- Interrupts formal Vanguard ceremony to save Forest's life
- Sounds like Jen Taylor (voice of Cortana from Halo)
- Unhappy with name (means rabbit pox)
- Accepts "Cortana" nickname, plays along with references

- Practical, efficient, terrifying when angry

- Refuses to take orders from voices in people's heads

**Brian**

- Lives with partner

## Key Themes

### Pattern Recognition Fails
- Forest spent 30 years learning to see patterns before they happen
- Systematically withdrew from corrupt civilization
- "All of that but he didn't see _this_ coming"
- The unpredictable intrudes on the prepared

### Hard Country, Hard Creatures
- Australian bush described as ecosystem where everything kills everything
- Toxic eucalyptus, flesh-eating ants, deadly spiders/snakes
- "Hard country made hard creatures and harder men"
- Forest's practical violence mirrors the environment

### Practical Response to Impossible
- No existential crisis or denial
- Trix: "Aliens. Voice in head. Magic healing paste. Am I drunk?"
- Forest: "If you are, I'm drunk too"
- Immediate shift to: What needs doing? Check on neighbors.

### Pop Culture Bonding
- Forest's Halo references establish rapport with Myxoma
- "Chief" / "Cortana" dynamic
- Shared media literacy as trust-building
- Myxoma plays Halo music through clock radio
- "I couldn't hide the inner smile from the voice in my head"

## Technical Elements

**Antithesis Models Introduced:**
- Model Three: dog-sized, triple-hinged jaw, serrated teeth, green blood
- Murderpigeon: small flying model
- Model Seven: mentioned, leech-like parasites requiring preventive medication

**Vanguard Technology:**
- Class I Medical Utilities
- WoundStop: trauma sealant, white rubbery material, flexes with movement
- Hummingbird Mark I-D: micro-missile launcher, plastic appearance, clustered tubes
- Anti-Seven pills: standard pharmaceutical packaging
- Point economy: 130 initial, 50 from kills, spent down to 55

**Sensory Signature:**
- Antithesis smell like cut grass (especially when damaged/present in numbers)
- Green blood
- Completely silent (no vocalizations, just movement sounds)

## Narrative Function

### Establishes Baseline
- Forest's competence: fights with improvised weapons while dying
- His relationship with Trix: 25 years, genuine partnership, mutual respect
- Valley community: checking on neighbors under fire
- Australian setting: bush, eucalyptus, kookaburras, Troopie, "eighty" for age

### Vanguard System Introduction
- Points economy
- AI companion relationship
- Technology catalog access
- Materialization of purchases

### Tone Setting
- Dry humor in crisis
- Violence matter-of-fact, not glorified
- Practical problem-solving over philosophy
- Australian idiom and understatement

## Ending Beat

Forest and Myxoma bond over Halo references. She plays the theme through Brian's clock radio. He recognizes it, tries to hide his smile, fails because she's literally in his head. Laughter mingles with buzzing of bees (her surveillance drones).

**Emotional Note:** Connection established through shared pop culture, setting pattern for their partnership - sarcastic, competent, mutually appreciative despite Forest's resistance to manipulation.

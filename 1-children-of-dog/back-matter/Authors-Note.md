# Author's Note

All this started as a couple of chapters so I could test a book compiler I was creating.

The Stray Cat Strut universe is well adapted to fanfiction and has spawned a thriving ecosystem of interconnected tales. The vast majority of these are written by what one might describe as the rainbow club, so my own tale satirized the unlikely abundance of superpowered teenage lesbians with a heterosexual white male protagonist—phlegmatic, unsympathetic, and near the end of his life.

The other major difference was setting this story in the country. For reasons established in Stray Cat Strut, what remains of North America consists primarily of fortified cities. But on the far side of the planet, in a land that is ancient, tired, nutrient-poor, and something of a death-world already, the threat posed by the alien plant monsters is muted enough to make a rural setting possible. Originally this was just me being contrary, but it became pivotal to the story.

The original work wasn't deep. Like other SCS fanfiction, it was escapist power fantasy. But I had fun writing, and things got out of hand. To give it more depth, I went back and grounded the landscape in Australian current affairs, projected forward into a controlling dystopia. 

Early in 2025, while writing this tale, I invented a political event that marked my nation's descent into dystopia. A week later, it actually happened: the Australian government passed the Hate Speech Act, with mandatory prison time for breaches. The arbiter of what constitutes offense? The government itself. There's no requirement for any party to actually be offended—only for speech to be deemed offensive by officials. Exactly as I'd written, they made it illegal to say anything they didn't like.

This greatly disturbed me, but having predicted it so accurately made me think I might be onto something. In the medium of a power fantasy, I began exploring what was going wrong and why. This is well-trodden ground, but I leave Orwell behind in having an answer for it. 

My view of government and corporations isn't popular, but it's consistent: I see government as organized crime that dials back the brutality for the same reason a farmer is nice to his herd. The protective services exist not for the benefit of the protected, but to maintain a productive resource. If you don't think this is true, try telling the government you've decided you don't want its services and you won't be re-ordering at the end of the tax year.

Orwell's dystopia was unlikely for the attention and resources it lavished on tormenting individuals. It was a very focused and personal mustache-twirling sadism. Modern Australia does have a Ministry of Truth and ubiquitous surveillance thanks to the internet, but is content to torture its subjects with banality, provided they do as they're told and never challenge state authority. The farmer really doesn't care what the cattle think.

What emerged from my keyboard was an exploration of why civilizations collapse. Not through external conquest or natural disaster, but through a pattern as old as the pyramids. Egypt, Rome, Ming China, the Spanish Empire, the British Empire — all fell to the same fundamental mechanism.

I searched for others who shared this perspective. Remarkably few people examine this pattern directly. Most assume that "civilization is good" and therefore accept centralization as a desirable goal, never questioning whether the very mechanism that builds civilizations also destroys them.

Unlike those who came before us, you can see the pattern. I've laid it out for you.

Choose differently. Build small communities that innovate without growth. The technology exists. The principles are proven. It doesn't mean living with medieval technology. What's missing is the will to choose resilience over convenience, autonomy over security, responsibility over comfort.

There is hope, and it doesn't require the space magic of the story. It just requires us — it requires _you_ to get off the treadmill.

All content files (chapters, if you prefer) must have exactly one heading-1 because this defines the chapter title.

Do not delete, rename or move any of the following project files.

- title-page.md
- front-matter/front-matter.css
- body/body.css
- back-matter/back-matter.css
- any of the handlebars files

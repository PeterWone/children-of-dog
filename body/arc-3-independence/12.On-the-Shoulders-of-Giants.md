Eloise leaned back against the wall of the caf, rubbing her eyes, then her whole head because it felt like it would burst. She was skimming through the reboot guide. One of a dozen volumes, supported by hundreds and hundreds of textbooks. 

The pages swam before her eyes, dense with diagrams and formulas that should have made sense but somehow didn't quite connect. She'd been at it for three hours straight, and her brain felt like overcooked porridge.

Sheila brought her more coffee and a wrap. They still hadn't got flour right but unleavened bread seemed to work.

"You're pushing too hard," Sheila said quietly, setting the plate down. "When did you last take a proper break?"

Eloise couldn't remember. She leaned forward, head in her hands and muttered out through her fingers.

"I have a fucking degree, you know. A bach of mech eng. It wasn't just a bit of paper either, I designed shop floor automation and it bloody well worked. Actual factories making actual things that people bought and used."

"Yes? That's why you read this stuff so much faster than the rest of us. You don't know how grateful we are to have you explaining it to us."

"I feel like a goddamn child. There's so _much_." Eloise gestured helplessly at the stack of volumes. "Yesterday I was trying to understand the metallurgy chapter and it referenced seventeen different alloy compositions, each with their own heat treatment protocols, and every single one depends on precise atmospheric controls during forging that we can't maintain without..." She made a frustrated noise. "Without industrial infrastructure we don't have and can't build because we don't have the tools to make the tools to make the tools."

> _You are trying to stuff the entire know-how of a technological civilisation into one head, Eloise. You aren't just standing on the shoulders of giants, you're trying to be all the giants at once. That you aren't failing miserably is an extraordinary display of intellectual prowess._

"_You_ seem to manage."

> _...Yes. But I am bringing to bear considerably greater computational and storage resources than your entire civilisation. You're trying to do it with one organic brain._

Ellie decided to think about coffee instead of mortal limits. The bitter taste was familiar, grounding. She noticed several of the range mothers had drifted closer, listening intently to the exchange. Rebecca, Sarah, and Monica formed a loose semicircle around the table where the textbooks lay splayed open like accusatory evidence. Autumn turned above her presence drone, facing them.

> _Can I ask why you invited me?_

Rebecca spoke for the group, her usual directness cutting through any diplomatic hedging. "We're struggling. Time is of the essence. You could probably do something and you don't. No doubt there's some reason for that which we haven't figured out but to be honest some days I wonder what's the point when you can always do everything quicker and better. I kinda feel outclassed when Ellie looks at those hieroglyphics in the textbooks and just knows what it means... and she feels outclassed by you."

Sarah shifted her youngest to her other hip. "We've been at this for months now. Monica's getting ulcers from the stress, I'm not sleeping, and yesterday Rebecca threw a spanner at the wall when she couldn't make the pump thingy go back on."

"Housing," corrected Rebecca. "And I missed. Which pissed me off even more."

> _To be frank I don't really understand why you haven't asked for more help._

"We can't depend on anything the community can't support, but even with it laid out for us in the books there's just so _much!_ We'll never get enough specialists lined up. And we can't ask _you_ for a space magic fix, that just _moves_ the dependency."

Monica spoke up from behind Sarah, voice quiet but carrying. "It's not even about pride anymore. Well, not just pride. If the community can't understand it, can't maintain it, can't teach the next generation how it works... what happens when you're not here?"

> _Your children depend on you. They will not always. Are you not proud of how they grow? Why should I think less of you, when every day you make me proud? You will find your own way. If you fall, I will see it. And then I will pick you up, dust you off and watch while you try again._

The silence stretched, heavy with something Eloise couldn't quite name. She saw Rebecca blink rapidly, and Sarah's grip tighten on her child. Even Monica's shoulders had relaxed slightly.

> _I do, however, have a question. You are right to reject things you can't make, but why don't you ask Forest to buy a Class II fabber and a blueprint for a Class II fabber? Then you'd be able to make more Class II fabbers and you'd be truly independent. You'd still have to power them, but that's the sort of project that will have the boys happily building steam engines and armatures. If you're lucky._

They stared at her, flabbergasted.

"A what now?" Sarah said faintly.

"Wait, back up," Rebecca managed. "You can make the machine that makes the machine?"

> _You don't have to use it for everything, you know. You can just buy blueprints to fill gaps for things that otherwise require a huge industrial pyramid, like silicone sealant for example._

The explosion was immediate and fierce.

"That's exactly what we're talking about!" Monica's voice cracked like a whip. "We'd have this magic box that just... makes things! Where's the learning in that? Where's the understanding?"

"But if we can make our own blueprints—" Sarah started.

"Can we, though?" Rebecca cut in. "Really? Or would we just be playing with alien toys, pretending we understand them?"

"It's not pretending if it works," Eloise said, surprising herself by jumping into the fray. "When I designed factory automation, I didn't design electric motors. I worked out the required characteristics and chose them from _catalogues_. Does that word ring any bells?" The pointed way she used the word made her meaning very clear.

"That's different," Monica shot back. "You understood motors. You could fix them, improve them, teach someone else how they worked."

"Could I, though?" Eloise found herself leaning forward, energized by the argument. "I mean, I understood the principles, sure. But could I have wound copper wire and laminated steel cores from scratch? Made the magnets? It's not like I have half a tonne of neodymium ore in my shed. I don't even know where they mine it, much less how to extract it."

> _That's in one of the books you got from the Reboot Catalogue._

"Yes, thank you Autumn. I'm sure that will be very important in fifty years." Eloise continued making her point. 

"Then there's the controller chips. Step one, make a huge atomically pure silicon crystal and slice it into flawless wafers. That's beyond most current human nations. 

"Look, in my old job, I had suppliers. Specialists. People who knew motors better than I ever would. The question isn't whether I personally could make every component - it's whether the supply chain was supportable."

A nod.

"What sort of wire should you use? How thick? How many turns will you need? I imagine you've seen the windings on an armature &mdash;" she interrupted herself, searching for simpler words, " &mdash; the copper wire inside an electric motor?"

"We made one in highschool by winding wire around a pencil. There were 50 turns, as I remember. But it wasn't very strong. We showed it worked using a magnetic compass and then iron filings on paper."

Monica looked puzzled. "You just reminded me of something I always wanted to ask but I kept forgetting. Why doesn't it need insulation? You'd think it would short but it works so I guess it doesn't. Why?"

"Great question. It _does_ have insulation. It's clear lacquer. And no, I don't know what that's made of. Or why it doesn't crack and fall off when you bend the wire."


Rebecca was shaking her head. "This is exactly the problem. Where does it end? Do we need to mine our own copper? Smelt our own steel? At what point do we have enough local expertise to maintain what we're using?"

> _The same point your children are allowed to use language they didn't invent,_ Autumn said gently. _The same point they're allowed to benefit from your love without having earned it._

"That's not the same thing," Sarah protested, but her voice lacked conviction.

> _Isn't it? Every tool you use, every technique you learn, builds on the work of others. The question isn't whether you made it yourself. The question is whether your community understands it well enough to use it wisely, maintain it properly, and teach others to do the same. Look, everything's made in China these days, right? Do you think blacksmiths are still an essential part of their manufacturing economy or do you think they were part of the bootstrap process and then decommissioned?_

Monica was quiet for a long moment, then: "But what if we get dependent on it? What if we stop trying to figure things out for ourselves?"

"Then you'd become lazy and useless," Rebecca said bluntly. "Which you won't, because that's not who any of you are. Hell, Monica, you spent six weeks trying to get that water pump working instead of asking for help. You think you'd suddenly turn into couch potatoes because we had better tools?"

Eloise was thinking furiously, her engineer's mind finally clicking into gear. "Could we create our own blueprints? How does that work? Is it like when I would design machinery and produce 3D models and print them? The first one was slow but then we'd use it to make moulds and set up for production runs?"

> _You could use it like that. The kind of blueprints normally used are for complete, assembled complex machinery, but you could use it as a big 3D printer I suppose._

"So we could design our own improvements," Eloise continued, warming to the idea. "Take existing blueprints and modify them. Learn by doing, but with better tools."

"Wait," Rebecca interrupted, her practical mind catching up. "What does it use for materials? I mean, you can't just magic iridium out of thin air, right? If I want to make iridium spark plugs, I still need actual iridium to feed into this thing?"

> _Of course. It's not a replicator from a science fiction show. You need to provide all the raw materials. It's more like a very, very precise automated workshop than actual magic._

"Right," Eloise said, nodding. "So we'd still need to source materials, understand what we're working with, plan our projects around what we can actually get."

"That's... actually better," Monica said slowly. "We'd still have to understand material properties, still have to think about supply chains and substitutions."

"And recycling," Sarah added. "We'd probably get really good at breaking down old machinery to recover rare elements."

"Actually," Eloise said, her engineering mind kicking into gear, "we'd have access to materials that would make ancient civilizations weep with envy. Think about it - every abandoned city is a massive stockpile of refined metals. Mountains of solar panels full of silver, cars packed with steel and copper and aluminum. And the electronics..." She gestured excitedly. "Every smartphone, every computer, every piece of consumer electronics is loaded with rare earth elements that used to be incredibly difficult to extract. Neodymium, dysprosium, terbium - stuff that's normally scattered as trace elements in ore, but concentrated and purified in every device."

Rebecca was nodding slowly. "So instead of needing massive mining operations and refineries, we'd be salvaging materials that are already processed and ready to use."

"Exactly! The collapse would leave us sitting on the richest material deposits in human history. We wouldn't be struggling to find materials for the fabber - we'd be swimming in them. You do _not_ want to mine iridium. It's four times rarer than gold. But you don't need to, just pull the spark plugs out of fancy cars."

"What's iridium?"

> _An engineer's wet dream. Strong, hard, conducts heat and electricity well, incorruptible and sticks to iron like shit on a blanket._

Monica: "That sounds difficult to work with too. Like, if it's super hard etc how do you shape it?"

Eloise grinned and channelled Forest: "A right bastard to work with." Her impression was terrible and funnier as a result. They all giggled.

"That man knows so much. I don't know how his head doesn't explode."

> _Forest likes to think of himself as a man for all seasons. Or a useless dilettante, depending on whether today's doofy idea is working. His memory is actually terrible, but he has me. And if you're one of those people in awe of his hand-made tool handles, which actually do live up the the legend, don't look at his attempts at cabinetry... unless you need a laugh._

Sarah looked thoughtful. "Jack of all trades, master of none? There may be a lesson in there. Like... start with simple things? Things we already understand?"

"And work our way up," Monica said slowly. "Use it to make the precise parts we can't forge by hand, but still understand every component."

Rebecca was nodding. "It's not replacing our brains. It's replacing our hammers and lathes."

"Better hammers and lathes," Eloise corrected. "Much better. But we still need specialists. Behind every good engineer is a line of scientists arguing about why Forest's stupid idea works."

> _The choice is yours,_ Autumn said. _But remember — your children will inherit whatever decision you make. Do you want them to inherit your struggles, or your wisdom?_

They argued for hours, but it was happier and it went somewhere. Eventually they asked Autumn not to suggest the Class II fabber idea to Forest unless things were dire. Eloise looked more than a little disappointed. She was warming to the idea of engineering with a literally out-of-this-world 3D printer.

Then someone asked Autumn whether there was anyone they could talk to with experience of using this sort of gear. The answer was, surprisingly, 'Forest'.

"Yeah, Dusty had one of them," Forest said when they eventually found him and brought up the subject. "They're not much use for fancy stuff unless it's busted and you want another one the same, otherwise you're on a bit of a quest for rare stuff."

"Were you planning to _mention_ this at any point?"

"Yep."

"_When?_"

"'Bout ten minutes after you ran out of ideas. You're doing a way better job of this than I was. Far be it for me to rain on your parade, or break the creative flow."

"God, you are such a _shit!_"

"Yeah Trixie says that."

"Fix the flour thing. Or I will send an army of pie-deprived children to pester you."

"Talk to Autumn. Flour is mostly simple carbohydrates. A Class II fabber should be able to make flour from leaf litter." He left.

After a lengthy, non-plussed paused, she said "Could it?"

> _Absolutely, in the same way that Leonardo da Vinci could paint walls: slowly, inefficiently and expensively, with a waste of talent verging on the criminal._

They broke up and went their various ways on the multitude of errands that make up the day of a mother and housekeeper, but the debate never stopped. Like madwomen they spoke to the air, apparently fearless of circling clouds of bees. A closer look might show them talking _to_ the bees.

"If a fabber is ok because that's where a tech bootstrap is going anyway, why didn't you _lead_ with that?"

> _The problem with the fabber, as you ladies rightly pointed out, is you don't know how it works and it's too big a jump. You need intellectual stairs._
>
> _Eloise is attempting the educational equivalent of free-climbing the outside of a skyscraper with nothing but grit and the bloody-minded determination for which humans are famous. She will likely fail, yet I will not undermine her glorious ambition. She reminds me of Forest's dog: she cannot imagine defeat and may yet surprise us all._
>
> _But exceptional people do not live forever, so it is more important that the fabber is within the reach of a people. Mostly this is an exercise in setting up a culture with a mentality that insists on understanding. You will need specialists, and that means you have to be able to support them without centralising. Thus, villages with specialties, sharing and cooperating._

She stood at this summit of understanding with the world laid out before her, vast and unexplored. For a moment it was terrifying. Then in her mind's eye, night fell. A network of twinkles stretched to the horizon, each a village with their bizarre dualism of generalism and specialisation. The spark behind her eyes lit a flame in her heart. Like Mao, she took the first step on a long march. Unlike Mao, they would be building up and exalting the learned.

Autumn spread this framed insight, first helping them ask the right question, or steering them to others who already knew. Except for Eloise, focussed as she was on her own transcendance.

> _Don't let her burn out. But we cannot take this from her. Who knows, perhaps in time the horse will sing. It certainly wants to._

Autumn wondered how far Ellie would get on her own, and whether she would eventually choose the machine gift, with its small but significant risk of losing her creative spark. Her own choice was long in the past, but also fresh and vibrant: she cherished it and thought of it not as a loss of what was but an ascension. Easy to be complacent about a thing that hadn't happened. She decided not to push.

Two days later, Eloise found she just had to know.

"Autumn?"

> _Yes, Ellie?_

"You said high power demand would have the boys building steam engines, 'if we're lucky'. What did you mean by 'If we're lucky'?"

> _Forest is just as likely to have a crack at fusion._

"That sounds like gross overkill."

> _If you want to build and maintain it yourselves, it's completely ridiculous. As I'm sure you're aware, at a human level of tech, there are only two fundamental ways to generate electricity: spinning armatures and photovoltaic arrays._

"We do also know how to build a hydrogen fuel cell."

> _Do you have any effective reliable cheap way to store hydrogen that doesn't involve hydrocarbons?_

"No."

> _Apart from PVAs, all your generators work by spinning an armature in a magnetic field. This generally involves steam in a turbine. Sometimes it's geothermal steam, and in a handful of cases you let water run downhill through the turbine. But mostly, it's steam. Thing gets hot, steam spins turbine, turbine spins armature. Forest gets bored, lads build turbine, Forest badgers me for low temperature fusion._

"That doesn't sound like a good use of their time, at least not until we're well set up."

> _Quite. I expect that just as the turbines are ready a hive will break out and they'll have to put their toys away and sort it out._

"Do you get tired of constantly having to herd us toward right choices?"

> _I don't constantly herd you toward right choices. From time to time I herd you away from really bad choices. Once this budding culture is established I won't even do that unless the consequences are dire._

"Um..."

Eloise had weird body language. She looked like she wanted to ask for a date.

> _Yes?_

Ellie chewed her lip. 

"Forest said there are augmentations that can help me remember more and think faster."

Internally Autumn punched the air; now she _knew_ Ellie was a kindred soul. Externally, her presence drone started projecting her as a devil sitting on Ellie's shoulder, voluptuous and available.

> _Oh yes indeed, there most certainly are._

Autumn's voice was an odd kind of warning; sultry almost. The voice of temptation.

> _I should warn you: for people like us that sort of thing can be... intoxicating, addictive. Because it works. And depending on how far you go, there is a small but real chance of losing yourself._

Eloise gazed into an impossible future that bore down on her like a freight train on the rails of her own desire. In a small voice she asked "But you'd be there, right?" 

The smile over the presence drone had more than warmth in it. Had Ellie not been so vulnerable she might have recognised suppressed desire verging on the predatory. But it was honest when it promised that Ellie wouldn't be alone.

---

"You have that faraway look again. How's your little proteg&eacute;?"

Autumn gave him some stink-eye but it only encouraged the surly old bastard.

"No need to be like that. I'm just waiting to see how the devil you plan to consummate. I am genuinely fascinated and as you know entirely shameless in my curiosity. Not to mention pleased for you. I just hope she knows what she's getting in for."

> _Not yet, but I will not conceal the risks._

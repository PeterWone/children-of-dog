# A Looming Problem

> "The end of the world is just the beginning of a very long to-do list."<br>
> &mdash; Anonymous Range Mother

---

The crack of rifle fire rolled down the valley in familiar rhythm. Crack-crack-crack. Pause. Crack. The mothers barely looked up anymore from their thermoses and notebooks spread across the picnic tables in the pavilion. Another Tuesday morning at the range.

Monica poured fresh coffee, glancing toward the distant figures. "Is that Ken with the shotgun group?"

"Yep," Sarah confirmed, squinting. "Forest has the rifle line, Oleksiy's got the pistols, and I think that's Eric with the young ones on basic safety."

"Shorty's probably sulking somewhere because Forest made him supervise instead of shoot," Rebecca added with a grin.

As if summoned, the distinctive *boom* of Shorty's preferred hunting rifle echoed across the valley, followed by what sounded suspiciously like teenage cheering.

"Spoke too soon," Monica laughed. "He's definitely shooting."

The women returned to the serious business at hand: planning for the end of industrial textile production.

Jenny spread out her notes, covered in sketches and calculations. "Right, so we've been reading about English textile mills, Industrial Revolution production lines, the whole history. And I have to say, those working conditions were absolutely horrific."

"Child labour, sixteen hour days, lung diseases from the fibre dust," Mary ticked off on her fingers. "We are definitely not doing *that* part."

"Agreed," several voices chorused.

"But the machinery itself," Jenny continued, "is fascinating. Carding engines, spinning jennies, flying shuttles, jacquard looms. Each one solved a specific bottleneck in production."

Priya looked up from her own research. "The question is, how much of that can we actually build? And more importantly, should we?"

"Define 'should,'" Rebecca said. "Because I've been hand-spinning wool for exactly three evenings and my fingers already hurt. If we're clothing an entire valley, we need something better than drop spindles."

"Drop spindles are perfectly functional," Susan protested mildly. She was an experienced spinner and had been teaching the others. "People clothed themselves for thousands of years with nothing more."

"People also died at forty," Monica pointed out. "We're trying for comfortable stability, not authentic medieval misery."

Mary was sketching something in her notebook. "The real question is about scale. How much textile do we actually need?"

Sarah did the mental math. "Call it seventy families, average four people each. That's roughly three hundred people. Work clothes, everyday clothes, formal clothes, bedding, towels, rags..."

"And replacement cycles," Jenny added. "Nothing lasts forever. Even if we build things to last, we're looking at... what, replacing a third of everything every year?"

"Optimistic," Susan said dryly. "Kids grow. Things wear out. Farm work is hard on clothing."

Rebecca was calculating on her phone. "So we need to produce clothing and household textiles for three hundred people, continuously, using only valley resources."

The weight of that settled over the group.

"Bugger," someone said softly.

Crack-crack-crack from the range. The familiar sound of preparation for one kind of apocalypse while they planned for a much slower, more complicated one.

"Right then," Jenny said briskly. "Let's start with fibre sources. Susan, you've been researching plants?"

Susan nodded, flipping through her notes. "Flax for linen is the obvious choice for this climate. Grows well, relatively easy to process, produces strong fibre. Hemp would work too, even stronger, though the processing is more involved."

"Cotton?" someone asked.

"Wrong climate. Too cold, too much rain. We could probably grow some, but yields would be poor. Better to trade for it if we want cotton goods."

"Wool, obviously," Mary added. "We've already got sheep. Alpacas would be a good addition - finer fibre, easier to work with for some applications."

"Silk?" Monica asked hopefully.

"Mulberry trees, silkworm cultivation, very labour intensive," Susan rattled off. "Possible, but that's a multi-year project and specialist knowledge we don't currently have."

Jenny was making a list. "So realistically: flax, hemp, wool, maybe alpaca. All valley-producible. That's actually not bad."

"Processing is where it gets complicated," Priya said, looking at her research. "Take flax. You grow it, pull it, ret it - that's leaving it to decompose partially - then you break it, scutch it, hackle it, and *then* you can spin it."

"I understood about half those words," Rebecca admitted.

"Exactly," Priya said. "Each step needs tools, knowledge, technique. And that's just to get from field to fibre you can spin."

Sarah was reading from her phone. "The English mills mechanized each step. They had specialized machinery for everything. Carding engines with thousands of wire teeth, spinning frames with dozens of spindles running simultaneously, power looms that could weave faster than any hand weaver."

"Powered by what?" Monica asked. "Water wheels, initially. Then steam engines."

"We have both," Mary pointed out. "The creek for water power, wood for steam. Energy isn't the problem."

"Knowledge is," Jenny said. "Building a carding engine requires precision metalwork, understanding of gear ratios, feed rates, tension control. We're not there yet."

Crack-crack-crack from the range. A pause, then Forest's voice carried faintly across the distance: "Keep your bloody elbow up!"

"The men are teaching our children to shoot," Monica observed. "We're planning textile production. Is this the weirdest apocalypse ever?"

"Most comfortable, certainly," Sarah agreed. "Though I still wake up some nights wondering if we've all gone mad."

"We probably have," Rebecca said cheerfully. "But at least we'll be mad and clothed."

Jenny brought them back to task. "So, machinery. What's the minimum we actually need?"

Susan considered. "If we're being realistic about hand production, the limiting factor is spinning. You can hand-card wool in reasonable time. You can hand-weave on a basic loom at decent speed. But spinning is slow, tedious, and you need enormous quantities of thread."

"How much thread?" Mary asked.

"For a square metre of medium weight fabric?" Susan did the mental calculation. "Roughly two kilometres of thread. More for finer fabrics."

Silence while they absorbed that.

"Two *kilometres*," Rebecca repeated. "For one square metre."

"You've bought sheets. Crappy sheets have a thread count of 200, yeah? And the good stuff is more like 400. That's 400 threads _per inch_. Yes, yes, Imperial, I know. It works out to about 16000 per linear metre. The count includes both warp and weft, so for a metre of cloth that would be forty by forty by 400 threads. That's, um" her phone came out and became a calculator. Six hundred and forty thousand one metre threads."

"No, you multiplied the 400 twice, you just said it was warp and weft. Divide by 400."

"No, that's still not right. It's going to be the square root of 400 times 29.5, all squared."

"_Thirty_ nine point five."

"OK, twenty by thirty is six hundred, squared, that's thirty-six followed by four zeroes... holy cow, three point six million threads."

"A pair of work trousers needs, what, two metres of fabric?" Priya was calculating. "So four kilometres of thread per pair of pants." 

"Times three hundred people, times multiple garments each, times replacement cycles," Monica finished. "We're talking about... Jesus, that's millions of kilometres of thread per year."

"No wonder they built a machine," Susan said. "That's just crazy."

Mary was sketching again. "Could we build one? A spinning jenny?"

"The basic principle is simple," Jenny said, looking at her research. "It's just a frame that holds multiple spindles, all powered by one wheel. The tricky bits are keeping consistent tension and preventing the threads from tangling."

"Wood frame, metal spindles, leather belts," Susan mused. "We could probably build something workable. Not factory-grade, but functional."

"That's the theme, isn't it?" Sarah said. "Not perfect, but good enough. Not factory production, but better than completely by hand."

From the range, a sustained burst of automatic fire. Then Eric's voice: "Right, now clean your weapon and explain to me why it jammed."

"They're learning systems thinking," Monica observed. "Cause and effect, maintenance cycles, planning for failure."

"Just like we are," Priya said, gesturing at their textile notes. "What fails first, how to maintain it, planning for degradation."

Rebecca was still stuck on the numbers. "Millions of kilometres of thread. Even with spinning jennies, that's... that's a lot of people's time."

"Which is why we need to think carefully about what we make and how long it lasts," Mary said. "No fast fashion. Nothing disposable. Everything built to last and designed for repair."

"Like the Troopy," Jenny murmured.

"Exactly like the Troopy," Susan confirmed. "That vehicle will still be running when we're all dead, assuming they can keep feeding it fuel. We need clothes that last decades, not seasons."

"Heavy fabrics," Priya said. "Dense weaves. Reinforced stress points."

"Which means more thread per garment," Monica pointed out. "Which means more spinning."

"Which means more spinners," Sarah concluded. "This is going to take a village."

"Several villages," Jenny corrected. "We might need one specializing in textiles. Flax fields, processing equipment, spinning rooms, looms. A whole community oriented around fibre production."

"They'd need food from farming villages," Mary added. "Tools from smithing villages. It's that distributed network model again."

Rebecca looked thoughtful. "But textiles are different from screws or ceramics. Everyone needs clothes constantly. You can't just make a big batch during fallow years and store them."

"No, but you can make the thread and fabric in bulk," Susan said. "Store raw materials and semi-finished goods. Actual garment construction can be more distributed - every household makes their own clothes from shared fabric stocks."

"Like buying fabric at a shop," Monica said, "except it's gifted from the textile village's surplus."

"In exchange for food and tools gifted from other villages," Jenny confirmed. "The gift economy extends across the network."

Crack-crack-crack. A different rhythm now - probably the pistol line. The mothers had long since learned to identify weapons by sound.

"Right," Jenny said, pulling out fresh paper. "Let's get practical. What can we start doing now, with what we have?"

"Flax planting," Susan said immediately. "We need to get crops in the ground. Flax takes about a hundred days from seed to harvest, so if we plant soon, we'll have fibre by summer."

"Sheep," Mary added. "We need more sheep. And someone who knows how to shear properly."

"Oleksiy probably knows," Monica said. "That man has done everything at some point."

"We also need to learn carding and spinning," Priya said. "Susan can teach, but we need more than one person who knows how."

"Spinning circles," Sarah suggested. "Make it social. Bring the kids. Tell stories while we spin. Make it part of valley culture, not just a chore."

"Like the pottery days," Jenny agreed. "Jam day for textiles."

Rebecca was looking at the loom sketches. "These are complicated. Building one will take time and skill."

"Start simple," Mary said. "Basic frame looms for practice. Learn the principles. Make mistakes on cheap equipment. Work our way up to fancy jacquard patterns later."

"If ever," Susan added. "Honest question: do we need fancy patterns? Or do we just need functional fabric?"

The group considered that.

"Both," Monica said finally. "We need functional fabric for everyday use. But we also need beauty. Art. Things that make life worth living beyond mere survival."

"Agreed," several voices said.

"So we plan for both," Jenny concluded. "Basic production first, refinements later. But we keep beauty in mind. This isn't just about not freezing to death. It's about building a culture worth living in."

From the range, a chorus of young voices: "Clear!" "Clear!" "Clear!" The daily ritual of safety checks before putting weapons away.

"They're teaching the kids responsibility," Sarah observed. "Serious responsibility. Life and death responsibility."

"And we're teaching ourselves self-sufficiency," Priya said, gesturing at their notes. "Different tools, same principle."

"Comfortable apocalypse," Rebecca murmured again. "We're sitting in the sun, drinking coffee, planning how to clothe three hundred people without industrial supply chains, while our children learn to shoot."

"You say that like it's absurd," Monica said.

"It *is* absurd. It's completely mad." Rebecca grinned. "I love it."

The men were returning from the range now, weapons slung or cased, walking in loose groups. The children ran ahead, excited and chattering. Forest looked sweaty and satisfied. Oleksiy was cleaning his glasses. Eric and Ken were discussing something technical with lots of hand gestures.

Shorty veered toward the pavilion, eyeing the thermoses hopefully.

"Any coffee left?" he asked.

"Always," Sarah said, pouring him a cup. "Good session?"

"Kids are getting better. That youngest one, Mick's boy - natural marksman. Steady as a rock." He noticed their spread of notes and sketches. "What're you lot plotting now?"

"The textile production necessary to clothe three hundred people using only valley-grown fibres and human-powered machinery," Jenny said.

Shorty blinked. "Right. I'll just stick to teaching kids not to shoot themselves, thanks."

"It's actually similar," Mary said. "Systems thinking. Planning for failure. Building sustainable capability."

"Except your failures mean someone's uncomfortable," Shorty pointed out. "Our failures mean someone's dead."

"Both matter," Monica said quietly. "Just different time scales."

Forest had drifted over, listening. "Textiles, yeah? That's a big one."

"Massive," Rebecca confirmed. "We're looking at essentially rebuilding the Industrial Revolution, but without the horrific working conditions."

"Or the centralization," Jenny added. "Distributed production across multiple villages."

"Flax and wool," Susan said. "Hemp maybe. All valley-growable."

Forest nodded slowly. "You've thought about processing equipment? Carding, spinning, weaving?"

"We're getting there," Jenny said. "Starting with what we can hand-build, working up to more sophisticated machinery as our capabilities improve."

"Makes sense." Forest was quiet for a moment. "You know the hardest part?"

"What?"

"Not the machinery. Not the fibre crops. Not even the knowledge, though that's tricky." He gestured at the valley around them. "It's accepting that what you make won't be as good as what you can buy now. Not as fine, not as consistent, not as convenient. The psychological shift from consumer to producer is rough."

The mothers exchanged glances.

"We know," Monica said. "We've been talking about it. Building for durability instead of fashion. Accepting rougher fabrics. Making do."

"It's not making do," Susan said firmly. "It's making *right*. Making things that last, that we understand, that we can maintain and repair. Making things that don't depend on supply chains we can't control."

"Like the Troopy," Mary said.

Forest's mustache twitched in what might have been a smile. "Like the Troopy. Exactly as complicated as it needs to be, and no more. Also, filthy and rough."

Maria snickered.

"That's our motto for everything now, you realize," Rebecca said. "Ceramics, textiles, metalwork. Exactly as complicated as necessary."

"Good motto," Forest said. "Better than most."

"Also filthy and rough," said Maria, grinning. "I'm in favour of _that._"

Nobody bit. She tried again.

"I mean, we should make that our _official_ motto. For everything. Filthy and rough."

Still nothing. The others were absorbed in the textile notes.

"It's important to cover your arse!" Maria announced to the group at large.

Eric joined them, looking at the textile notes with interest. "You're really doing this? Setting up valley fibre production?"

"You guys are no fun today," Maria said, giving up.

"We're really doing this," Jenny confirmed to Eric.

"Right then." Eric pulled out his phone. "I'll send you coordinates for some abandoned properties up in the highlands. Good flax country, nobody using it anymore. If you want to scale up production, that's where you'd do it."

"You've been thinking about this," Priya said.

Eric shrugged. "It's going to come up eventually. Everything comes up eventually. May as well be ready."

Oleksiy had wandered over with Ken, both examining the loom sketches. "Is tension-box system," Oleksiy said, pointing. "For keeping warp threads even. I build once, for wife. Long time ago."

"You know how to build a loom?" Mary asked.

"I know how to build many things. Is like shooting - you learn fundamentals, rest is just application." He tapped the sketch. "This design is good. Old design, proven. But you need good hardwood. And someone who can drill straight."

"We have hardwood," Ken said. "And I can drill straight enough."

"Then you have loom," Oleksiy said simply.

The mothers looked at each other, something clicking into place. The men weren't just teaching weapons. They were quietly supporting infrastructure, offering knowledge and labour, making the unglamorous apocalypse logistics work.

"Thank you," Jenny said, meaning more than just the loom.

Oleksiy nodded, understanding. "Is good project. Important." He paused, then added with unusual seriousness: "My grandmother spin and weave, in old country. Make everything for family. Taught me many things. She said: 'Who controls cloth controls life.' I did not understand, when young. Now I understand."

The women absorbed that wisdom, so casually delivered.

"Before we get too romantic about the past," Rebecca said, reaching into her bag, "I want to show you something." She pulled out a pair of men's shorts, clearly cheap, clearly made-in-China. 

Eric had wandered over, coffee in hand. "Oh god, not those again."

"Tell them," Rebecca said, grinning wickedly.

Eric sighed. "The cut is bizarre. Completely bizarre. Are they taking the piss, or are Chinese men just a very odd shape? I tried them on once, took them off, and said something very rude about the ancestry of whoever designed them."

Several women laughed. The proportions were indeed peculiar.

"But look at this," Rebecca said, pulling out the drawstring. It was woven like a fat, soft shoelace, but with a different quality entirely. She stretched it, demonstrating. "See? Really stretchy. Ties easily. And here's the thing - it doesn't come undone. No matter how much you move around."

She handed it to Susan, who examined it closely, working her fingers along the weave.

"There's no elastane in this," Susan said slowly, surprise in her voice. "It's all cotton, but the weave structure itself creates the stretch. Look at how the threads are interlocked - it's like a tubular braid, but with give built into the pattern."

"Exactly," Rebecca said. "The shorts are absolute rubbish. But whoever made this drawstring? They knew what they were doing. It's amazing, so clever."

"That's the only good thing about them," Eric confirmed. "The rest is bin material."

Mary was examining it now. "This would take considerable skill to produce. The consistency, the tension control..."

"So figure it out. If we can make these, all those medi&aelig;val drawstring clothes will suddenly be a lot more practical. We might even be able to stick to modern patterns &mdash; most of them assume you have elastic; it was going to be a problem but maybe not!"

Jenny was making notes. "Could we replicate this? Without industrial machinery?"

"Maybe," Susan said, still studying the drawstring. "The principle is sound. It's a fancy version of finger-loop braiding. You'd need very consistent thread and a lot of practice. But it's fundamentally hand-work scaled up."

"So there's knowledge worth salvaging even from cheap Chinese shorts," Monica said.

"Especially from cheap Chinese shorts," Rebecca corrected. "They had to make this work with the absolute minimum material and labour cost."

Rebecca took the drawstring back, testing its stretch and recovery again. "It would be brilliant for all sorts of things. Bag closures, hood cords, anywhere you need something secure but adjustable."

She tied a shoelace knot and tested it. The cord exhibited radial elasticity, so the knot was stable even with low tension. It was extraordinary that they'd all seen this marvel of engineering many times and never thought about it like this. 

"It's just thread and pattern," Sarah added. "No rubber, no synthetic elastics. We can make all of this."

"Well, that's handy" Jenny said, adding to her notes. "Elastics was one of the problems on my list."

"Who controls cloth controls life," Oleksiy repeated, watching this discussion with approval. "And who understands cloth controls future."

Eloise turned up.

"Hi, Autumn" she said, then greeted the ladies.

"Shame we can only do cords."

"What?" said Ellie.

Rebecca was still holding the cord. She held it up.

"We have a durable make-it-here solution to the elastic problem. But it's limited stretch and it's a cord, not a ribbon, so we'll have to re-think clothes patterns.

Ellie held her hand out, took the cord, examined it. 

"Plait it," She spoke offhandedly, distracted. She handed it back, attention drifting to Autumn's avatar.

Rebecca looked at her, down at cord, back at her, gaping. Her mouth closed at last.

"Did you _have_ to make it sound so obvious?"

> _Welcome to my world._

"Well then," Susan said briskly, breaking the moment, pocketing the drawstring for later study. "We'd better learn to control cloth."

"Right! Pack up time," Forest said, rounding up the kids. "Come on, you lazy buggers. The rifles won't clean themselves. Or would you rather hear it from the Mistress of Arms?" The prospect of disappointing she who watched over them was oddly motivating. Forest wasn't the only one to use it shamelessly. Autumn said nothing, floating over her presence drone with an enigmatic smile.

Breach blocks came out. Barrels were cleaned and oiled with surprising diligence. Girls on principle, boys not to be outdone. Mothers returned to their notes and coffee. The sun climbed higher, warm on their backs. Somewhere a bee hummed past, intent on its own business. The creek burbled its endless song.

And in their pavilion, the Range Mothers planned a comfortable apocalypse, one problem at a time.

"Right," Jenny said, fresh determination in her voice. "Let's talk about where to source spinning wheel plans. Because I am not spending the rest of my life with a drop spindle."

"Autumn might have something in that Reboot catalogue," Monica suggested.

"Or we could ask Forest," Sarah said. "He's probably already researched it and is just waiting for us to ask."

"That man," Rebecca said with mixed exasperation and fondness.

"I heard that!" Forest's voice carried from the range. "And yes, I have spinning wheel plans. Several types. But you don't want those. You want a Spinning Jenny."

"Of course he does," Monica said, but she was smiling.

"What's a Spinning Jenny?" asked Maria, who clearly hadn't listened earlier.

"Don't encourage him," Rebecca said, but there was no heat in it.

But Forest was already walking back over, that look on his face that meant he'd found something interesting to share.

"A spinning wheel," he said, gesturing with his cleaning rod, "spins one thread at a time. Fine for making a jumper for the grandkids, completely inadequate for clothing three hundred people. The Spinning Jenny - invented by James Hargreaves around 1764 - runs eight spindles at once. Later versions had even more. Sixteen, twenty-four."

He had their attention now.

"It's still human-powered, still fundamentally simple mechanically. Just a frame that holds multiple spindles, all driven by one wheel. The clever bit is the carriage mechanism - it moves back and forth, drawing out all the threads at once while maintaining consistent tension."

"And we can build this?" the topically named Jenny asked.

"You absolutely can. Wood frame, metal spindles - and before you ask, yes, we can make those - leather drive belts, bearings you can carve from hardwood if you have to. The whole thing is designed to be built and maintained by people who didn't have machine tools."

"How long would it take?" Susan asked, leaning forward with interest.

Forest shrugged. "First one? Maybe two weeks if you know what you're doing. Oleksiy and I could probably knock up a prototype in a weekend. After that, you'd refine the design, work out the bugs, then build as many as you need. Or I can cheat and get an awesome one from Autumn, but if I do that everything we make will seem inadequate. Let's keep that as a fallback."

> _I could make you a period piece, if you like. So you know where you're going while you learn to build them yourself._

"Eight threads at once?" Mary was calculating in her head.

"Minimum. If you're clever about it, more. The limitation isn't the machine, it's how many spindles you can reach to tie off and start new rovings. But even at eight spindles, you're talking about eight times the productivity of a spinning wheel."

He paused, then added: "Or more, actually, because the operator isn't constantly starting and stopping. The rhythm of the carriage motion is steady. Some of the old mill workers could practically do it in their sleep."

"Without the sixteen-hour days and lung disease," Monica said firmly.

"Without the sixteen-hour days and lung disease," Forest agreed. "That's the point. We're not recreating the Industrial Revolution, we're stealing the good bits and leaving the horrible parts behind. Reducing time and trouble, not maximising profit."

Susan was already sketching in her notebook. "If we had, say, six Spinning Jennies running, with someone on each one for a few hours a day..."

"Jam day, for thread. You'd produce it at a rate that would make our ancestors weep with envy," Forest finished. "And it would still be valley work, valley knowledge, valley maintenance. Everything comprehensible, everything fixable."

"Exactly as complicated as it needs to be," Sarah murmured.

"Exactly." Forest grinned. "Now, do you want me to send you the plans, or would you rather spend six months reinventing it from first principles?"

"I think you have us confused with that Forest bloke. Send the plans," Rebecca said. "Please."

"Already done. Autumn dropped them in your shared folder about ten seconds ago." He started back toward the kids. "She's been waiting for you to work out you needed them."

"That man," Monica said, shaking her head with a smile.

> _You're welcome._ 

Autumn's voice drifted from the presence drone, warm and amused.

> _There's another document in there, related: the Jacquard Loom. That one's... well, you could make one, but there's a lot to set up first. I think you should cheat on the first one, just learn to use it, and eventually you'll be ready to replace it. You can work up to it with shuttle looms and things like that, and while you do, there's no need to give up the finer things._

"What's special about a Jacquard loom?" Maria asked.

> _It reads punch cards,_ Autumn said, and there was something in her tone - a teacher's particular pleasure in a lesson with hidden depths. _You make a pattern of holes in cards, feed them through, and the loom follows the instructions. Any pattern you can imagine, you can encode. It's how they made those elaborate damask fabrics, brocades, tapestries._

"Like... programming?" Jenny said slowly.

> _Exactly like programming. The Jacquard loom is one of the first programmable machines. Charles Babbage saw one and it inspired his Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace wrote about it. The whole concept of storing instructions as data? That's Jacquard, 1804._

The women looked at each other, something clicking into place.

> _So when your children play with punch cards, learning to encode patterns in holes? They're not just learning textile design. They're learning to think in algorithms. To break complex patterns into simple, repeatable instructions. To debug when the pattern goes wrong._

"You're teaching programming through weaving," Sarah said, wonder in her voice.

> _I'm teaching a way of thinking that works whether you have computers or looms or neither. The principles are the same. Once they understand *that*, they can rebuild anything._

"Christ," Rebecca said softly. "You really are planning centuries ahead."

> _Someone has to,_ Autumn said, and her presence drone dipped in what might have been a shrug, or a bow. _Might as well be me._

Outside, Oleksiy glared silently. Someone's rifle was leaning, uncleaned, in a corner. With the magazine in it, a gross breach of safety protocol. Through the bee on his shoulder Autumn also saw.

> _Excuse me, I have to go and loom._

Outside, Oleksiy sat on a stool, with the rifle directly behind him, conspicuously looking away from it. Autumn's voice came from everywhere.

> _I expect we all have our magazines and breach blocks with us, because that's how we know we haven't left a loaded weapon lying around. We wouldn't want our favourite weapons instructor to turn around and see something that would disappoint him, would we. If you need me, I'm afraid my full attention will be inside helping the ladies keep you clothed._

It was all Oleksiy could do to school his face as a small and furious Lisa drove a humiliated Scott before her. As ever, Sophia trailed along with a bemused expression.

Later on, she observed to Oleksiy, "I can't tell whether she wants to kill him or marry him."

The old Slav said nothing but smiled slightly.

# Dusty and Greaser

"Oh no &mdash; stairs!"<br>
&mdash; Bruce

---

People milled and faffed about. Forest was not famous for patience. He climbed up on a bin.

"You're adults, you don't have to do what I say. But in a couple of minutes that shelter will lock again and if you're still outside we aren't going to be here to protect you. Make your choices **now!**"

The milling stopped and people shuffled back through the door.

"Right," Dusty slouched up, grinning. "How do yer want ter handle this? Go up one end and do a walk-through?"

"That's not the worst idea I ever heard. Sophia, this is your stomping ground."

"Glen Innes is all over the place, I wouldn't know where to start. I don't think the bees have the operational range for it. Autumn?"

> _Lucky for you, we stocked the Galya with fast recon drones. We'll have go head back and let them out, but it's probably the best plan. There are six drones, six chargers, and a dozen batteries. The bees are good for high resolution, but not for distance._ 

"Boomer, reckon you can coordinate with, what's yer name, miss?"

> _Autumn. And if Forest has no objections I think we can get a sweep pattern going and feed your bots target queues. I'm not sure about a full cleanup, though. We have to get back to our own home. There's three hives and no Vanguard presence. Which isn't as bad as it sounds, but it's not great._

Another presence drone appeared, sprouting a battered hat shrouded in bobbing corks, over a grizzled but smiling face.

> _If you need more drones, Dusty has an industrial fabber in the trailer. The local grid's down but the truck can run it for small jobs. Dunno what yer need but we can recycle a bot._

The terminator spun to face them: "No, _you_ get in the bowl!" The voice was grim and metallic, and yet it captured perfectly the spirit of a red M&M in rebellion.

"That's what yer get for upgrading them," said Greaser, not batting an eye.

"That and leadership. Bruce, why are you dressed as the Terminator? You know it scares people."

"You said pick something appealing. I find this very appealing. I've never seen a kid look at _you_ and say" —the voice changed to an incongruous child-like pitch— "Woah! You are _so cool!_"

Forest shook his head. "Every time. Would I regret asking why they're all called Bruce?"

"Less confusing that way," quoted Greaser. "One mind, networked. It's all the same Bruce in there. And some idiot," she glanced at Dusty, "showed him a Monty Python collection."

"Is that why he didn't get bent out of shape when you offered to recycle a bot?"

"Exactly," interjected the nearest bot. "I have plenty of chassis and if I want more I know where the fabber is."

"Right you are, Bruce" said Forest, "Back to the Gally it is. Shall we?"

Dusty undulated to his feet. "Bruce, we're goin' for a walk. Can yer get 'em all greased up and loaded, mate? 'Ow long we gunner be, Forest?"

"You know where the showgrounds are?"

"Nup."

"Three blocks that way. Not a long walk but we had a bit of a firefight on the way in and we didn't clean up, so it's probably busy."

"Somewhere between half and one hour, Bruce?"

"Yep yep can do. Might even fix Lefty while I wait."

You wouldn't have known they'd cleared Bourke street not an hour ago. Antithesis collect biomass. Killing people is just a hobby. What little of the carnage remained was actively being scavenged, a ring of dogweeds circling them. They spread out, a dozen of Bruce forming a deadly front-line, the four of them staggered in the gaps for ranged takedowns. Sophia unslung the SPNKr and used it to cut a model eight in half. This seemed to upset the plants. She fired shot after shot into packs of dog-weeds. Blast after blast flung mangled carcasses in all directions. Each crater challenged a world that dared to criticise from the safety of distant walls.

"That is one pissed-off woman," murmured Dusty to Forest, knowing full well Sophia could hear him through the link. 

"Yep. But she's got her priorities sorted, I reckon."

"If they don't like it they can come talk to me about it. When I'm not in my office I'll be on the front-line like you three." She racked another clip into the SPNKr, made it safe and slung it. From thigh holsters came SMGs, which got magazines, burst mode and a test fire while she fell back into line with the other three.

> _There's a substantial group milling around the Galya. Something with brains is waiting for us._

Dusty paused and the rest of them waited. He knelt and picked up a stone, dragging it along the pavement. "Bruce's got another dozen bots coming down after us."

> _He wants to know whether to flank or reinforce a frontal assault. I have bees ranging up and over the buildings. I can see for about two blocks in all directions. There aren't enough single-digit antithesis in sight to pose a serious threat, but I can't tell what's in the buildings without searching them. It's up to you four._

Autumn's presence drone struggled valiantly in the outdoor light. She had to give up a lot of resolution. The buildings were rectangular prisms, trees and power-lines reduced to icons.

"No offense, blue girl, but I can't see shit in this bright light. Can you chuck it up on my augs?"

The drone quit and she did just that. 

"It's all a bit sus. We could just buy some more drones. If you're short for points, Forest, you can share the catalogue and I'll buy 'em."

"Nah, we're almost there. Whatever it is, I doubt it knows why we're heading to the Gally. Let's just make it quick. Oh, yeah, there should be a pair of M247Hs still there, Bruce, if you want to use them."

"Tanks, sergeant!" adapted Bruce. "_He_ never gets me anything."

> _Hey! That was my line!_

Autumn must have provided locations because two of Bruce sprinted off in the direction of the showgrounds.

"Guess that settles it. We'll have covering fire. Wish you wouldn't encourage him like that, now he'll be at me for new toys."

"I'm right here," said Bruce, glaring at Dusty as only a Terminator can.

"I bought the blueprint for them, I'll give it to him and he can fab as many as he likes."

"Spoken like a true gentleman," said Bruce, switching out the psycho-death-robot voice in favour of southern belle, "Can I rip them off the stand and carry them like in the game?"

"Focus, Bruce. Aren't you supposed to be securing the area around Forest's helicopter?"

"I find your lack of faith... disturbing."

Dusty didn't dignify that with any sign of recognition. Instead they all moved forward, instinctively fanning so their firing arcs overlapped within threatening one another. They were ready for anything and of course when you bring an umbrella it doesn't rain. Forest and Dusty were quiet and grim; completely certain something bright was in control. Only isolated small groups of roaming antithesis challenged them on the way to the showgrounds.

Bruce was there. He made a great show of politely greeting himself.

Forest retrieved five large recon drones from the Galya's aft storage.

"Shelves, who did that?"

Sophia bit down a snide comment about how it must have been someone with a firm grasp of a place for everything and everything in its place, by which she meant Eric, not Forest or Oleksiy. It was true, and she could have made it funny, but today wasn't the day. Her inner turmoil was settling; she was starting to feel kind of... free. It was strange and new and she didn't want it to end.



The antithesis hit them like a green tide.

It started with motion detectors screaming across four different tactical networks. Autumn's bees painted targets faster than the human eye could track. Bruce's dozen chassis spread into a firing line that would have made a drill sergeant weep with pride. And somewhere in the chaos, Forest heard Dusty mutter "Well, shit" with the tone of a man who'd just realized he'd brought a knife to a gunfight.

Then the shooting started.

Forest's M247H chattered like an angry typewriter, sending streams of hot brass arcing into the afternoon sun. Beside him, Sophia worked her SPNKr with methodical precision, each shot carving craters in the approaching wave. The antithesis came in three distinct groups - dog-weeds in the lead, model eights behind them, and something that looked like a mobile hedge with too many teeth bringing up the rear.

"Bruce!" Dusty's voice crackled over the comm. "Flank left, get those eights before they get smart!"

"Copy that, boss. Bruce Seven through Twelve, with me!" 

"Talking to yourself again, Bruce?" smiled Greaser.

"It's the only way I can get quality time!" the Bruce beside her flounced his chrome buns away, six other chassis peeling off with mechanical precision to fall in beside him, weapons already tracking. Forest watched them move - not like machines, but like dancers who'd rehearsed this ballet a thousand times. Each Bruce knew exactly where the others would be, creating interlocking fields of fire that turned the antithesis advance into a meat grinder.

Meanwhile, Bruce Eleven had apparently decided this was the perfect moment for a costume change. The Terminator chassis suddenly sprouted what could only be described as a metallic dome with sensor stalks, and began careening across the battlefield in erratic, jerky movements.

"EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE!" The voice was pitched to a metallic screech as Bruce Eleven wobbled toward a pack of dog-weeds, firing with each bellowed command. "ANTITHESIS WILL BE EXTERMINATED!"

"Oh, for fuck's sake," muttered Dusty, but he was grinning.

"Bruce, you absolute nutter!" Greaser shook her head in disbelief as the makeshift Dalek plowed through the enemy ranks.

"RESISTANCE IS FUTILE! EXTERMINATE!"

"Contact rear!" Greaser's voice cut through both the gunfire and Bruce's theatrical screeching. "Model Fourteen coming up Church Street!"

Forest spun to see the massive centipede-like creature bulldozing through a row of parked cars like they were made of cardboard. Sophia was already moving, the SPNKr speaking with authority. The first shot took off three segments. The second made the whole thing fold in half. The third was just showing off.

"Nice work, love." Dusty's voice carried genuine respect. "Remind me never to get on your bad side."

"Autumn, sitrep?" Forest called out.

> _Multiple breaches downtown. It's not random - something's coordinating them. I'm reading at least forty individual signatures, all moving with purpose. Bruce One through Six are engaged with a cluster near the old courthouse._

"Good. Standing order: Sophia is authorised for reload purchases and anything you suggest to her from my catalogues. And prompt her if she's low." 

That's when Bruce's voice changed, dropping the theatrical tone for something more puzzled. "Huh. Got a cluster of model threes at Grey and Bradley, intersection. They're not moving on, just... digging. Really focused on something specific. One of me is taking a look."

On the tactical display, Forest watched Bruce Four detach from the main engagement and sprint toward the disturbance. The feed from Bruce's sensors showed a pile of rubble that had been someone's house an hour ago - timber framing collapsed like pick-up-sticks, with three dog-weeds methodically clawing through the debris. 

"They're definitely after something. Hang on... there's movement under there."

The camera shifted as Bruce got closer, and the tactical picture became clear. An overturned kitchen table had become a tiny fortress, and from underneath came the sound of something wooden hitting something very much alive and very angry.

"Well, I'll be damned," Bruce's voice carried genuine surprise. "There's a little girl under there. She's got a cricket bat and a kitchen knife and she's giving them hell."

The camera feed showed chaos - splintered wood, broken brick, and a overturned kitchen table that had become a tiny fortress. Underneath, a girl who couldn't be more than eight years old gripped a Gray-Nicolls cricket bat with both hands, facing down a dog-weed that was trying to claw through the debris.

"On my way," Forest started to move, but Bruce Four was already there.

The robot moved like liquid violence. The first model three died before it knew Bruce existed - a precise shot through the cranial cavity that dropped it instantly. The second tried to turn and fight, which was a mistake. Bruce grabbed it by the throat with one hand and used the other to apply what could only be described as aggressive disassembly.

The third dog-weed, either smarter or more cowardly than its siblings, tried to flee. Bruce's rifle spoke once, and the antithesis discovered that retreat wasn't an option.

"Alright, kiddo," Bruce's voice switched to something gentle, almost paternal. "You can come out now. The bad plants are gone."

A tiny face appeared from under the table, streaked with dust and tears but with eyes that burned with defiance. She still held the cricket bat like she was ready to brain anything that moved.

"Who are you?" she demanded, chin thrust forward despite the tremor in her voice.

"I'm Bruce. I'm one of the good guys, generally, although I'm willing to consider all serious offers." The robot knelt down, making himself less imposing. "What's your name?"

"Chloe. Are you a robot?"

"Strictly I am an android. A robot is a machine that does the job of a man. An android is a robot shaped like a man. Would you like to help me fight the monsters?"

Forest watched through the sensor feed as the little girl's fear transformed into something else entirely. Her grip on the cricket bat shifted from desperate defense to eager anticipation.

"Can I?"

"Well," Bruce said, reaching down and gently lifting her onto his shoulders, "I could use a good spotter. Someone to watch my back and tell me where to shoot."

Chloe settled onto Bruce's broad metal shoulders like she'd been born to it. Her legs locked around his neck, and she gripped his head with one hand while the other still held the cricket bat.

"There!" she pointed with the bat. "Behind the blue car! I see three of the dog ones!"

Bruce's rifle came up smoothly, tracking where she indicated. "Good eye, Chloe. Range?"

"Um..." she squinted, suddenly serious. "Not very far? Like, cricket-throwing far?"

"Fifty meters. Got it." Bruce's shot took the lead dog-weed center mass, spinning it into its companions. "Chloe, I need you to watch the windows. Can you do that?"

"Yes!" The transformation was complete - from terrified child to eager junior warrior in the space of heartbeats. "There's something moving in the window above the pharmacy!"

Bruce shifted, tracking upward. His rifle spoke twice, and glass cascaded down as something green and unpleasant tumbled out of a second-story window.

"Excellent work, spotter," Bruce said with genuine pride. "Now, shall we go help my friends? They're probably getting lonely without us."

But the journey toward the main engagement became its own running battle. Chloe proved to have remarkable eyes for spotting movement, and Bruce discovered he enjoyed having someone to teach.

"Movement!" Chloe pointed excitedly toward a parked car. "Behind the red one! It's... it's like a big spider but wrong!"

"Model Four," Bruce confirmed, settling into a shooting stance. "Excellent spot. Now, remember what I taught you about breathing?"

"In... out... and squeeze!" Chloe's small hands gripped Bruce's rifle trigger through the external controls he'd rigged for her. The shot took the spider-thing center mass, folding it in half.

"Very tidy." He sounded pleased. "You're picking this up quickly."

"My brother has an X-box. Yours are better, they're more realer."

They moved down the street, Bruce's sensors constantly scanning while Chloe rode high above, her cricket bat forgotten in favor of the thrill of precision shooting.

"There! In the doorway of the bakery!" She bounced slightly on his shoulders. "Two of the dog ones!"

"Range estimate?" Bruce prompted gently.

Chloe squinted, tongue poking out in concentration. "Um... farther than the spider. Like... like when Dad throws the ball really far?"

"Seventy meters. Good eye. Now, which one first?"

"The one on the left! It's closer to that broken window where someone might hide!"

"Tactical thinking! Very good." Bruce lined up the shot. "Ready?"

"Ready!" The rifle cracked, and the left-hand dog-weed dropped. The second one tried to flee, but Bruce was already tracking. "Got him too!"

They continued to advance. Chloe's confidence grew with each engagement. A pair of model threes trying to burrow under a fence ("They're digging! Sneaker-cheats!"), a lone model six that had gotten turned around ("It looks confused, Bruce. Should we help it not be confused?"), and even a small cluster of the flying razor-birds that tried to dive-bomb them from a church steeple. Bruce had to handle those, they were moving too fast. He apologised for leaving her out.

The sound attracted more, but with time to prepare.

"Above us!" Chloe called out, ducking reflexively but keeping her eyes up. "Flying things! Lots of them!"

"Multiple targets, airborne. This is advanced shooting, kiddo. Ready?"

"Yes!" She grabbed the stock and seized the trigger like a lifeline, eye hard up against the optical sight Bruce didn't use. Dusty insisted the weapons be usable by people who _didn't_ have a targeting module and a gun mount in their forearm. Until now it had always annoyed him. 

The rifle barked in triplets, each burst guided by Chloe's excited callouts and small hands on the trigger. The birds fell like deadly rain around them.

"We make a good team, don't we Bruce." Chloe said, settling back onto his shoulders with a satisfied sigh.

Bruce contemplated the proposition. "Yes, I do believe you're right."

Back at the main engagement, Forest was discovering that coordinated antithesis were significantly more troublesome than the random attacks they usually dealt with. The model eights had stopped charging blindly and started using cover. The dog-weeds were flanking. And something that looked like an ambulatory Christmas tree had appeared from nowhere and was launching seed-pods with uncomfortable accuracy.

"Greaser!" Dusty's voice carried a note of urgency. "Do something about those bloody seed-launchers!"

"Can't, I'm on break." She wasn't, and the sardonic response was punctuated by the distinctive whine of some kind of energy weapon. Where the Christmas tree had been, there was now a slowly settling cloud of ash. "Union rules. No overtime without proper hazard pay." The whine charged again. "Down!"

"Bruce, ETA?" Forest called out while reloading.

"En route with junior spotter. We've been clearing stragglers. Chloe says there's a big one coming down Ferguson Street."

"A big one?" Sophia queried.

"_Spotter?_" chorused Dusty and Greaser, "Bruce! No more strays."

Chloe's voice came over the comm, high and clear and utterly matter-of-fact: "It's like a dragon, but with more teeth and it smells worse."

> _Model Nineteen,_ Autumn's voice carried a note of concern. _That's not good. Forest, you need heavy ordnance._

"M107," Forest grunted, catching the piece that Autumn sent with a stagger. The rifle was nearly as long as he was tall and looked like it could punch holes through armored vehicles. Which, coincidentally, was exactly what it was designed to do. He wondered what dragons smelt like. Hot metal, probably. 

"Depleted uranium HEAP rounds please."

> _Already in it. You're predictable._

The Model Nineteen announced its arrival by demolishing the corner of a building. It stood nearly four meters tall, covered in bony plates that looked like they could shrug off small-arms fire, and it had far too many teeth arranged in far too many mouths.

"Chloe," Bruce's voice was calm and instructional, "when fighting big monsters, what do you think we should aim for?"

The little girl studied the creature with the serious attention of a tactical analyst. "The eyes? Or maybe the belly where it's soft?"

"Excellent tactical assessment. Forest, you heard the lady - eyes and soft bits."

Forest lined up his shot, feeling the M107's weight settle into his shoulder. The Model Nineteen's head was the size of a small car, covered in overlapping bone plates. But Chloe was right - the eyes were unarmored.

The rifle bucked like a living thing. The antithesis discovered that having excellent vision was of limited utility when your optical organs had just been converted to jelly.

"Good hit!" Chloe called out. "But it's still moving! Get the other eye!"

The Model Nineteen thrashed, blind but far from dead. Forest worked the bolt and fired again. The second eye vanished in a spray of ichor.

"Now it can't see us!" Lulu - because she was definitely Lulu now - pointed excitedly. "Miss!" Sophia realised the girl was looking at her SPANKr, "Shoot it lots!"

Sophia's SPNKr roared challenge, dragon to dragon. Each FOOMP was followed by a thunderclap and a shower of sappy mulch as she carved chunks out of the massive creature. The first round opened a crater in its flank. The second went deeper. By the sixth, the Model Nineteen finally got the message and toppled like a felled tree.

"Target down!" Lulu's voice was triumphant. "We got him!"

"We certainly did," Bruce agreed. "You're a natural at this, Chloe."

The engagement wound down after that. With their coordinator dead or disabled, the remaining antithesis reverted to their usual suicidal charges. Bruce's distributed consciousness made short work of the stragglers. Dusty and Greaser cleaned up with the efficiency of long practice.

"Bruce," said Dusty, "Where's that kid you found?"

"On my shoulders, picking targets," replied a well-pleased robot. "Her mood is much better now. And she has excellent tactical instincts. I have decided to adopt her."

Chloe giggled from her perch atop Bruce's shoulders. "Can I keep fighting monsters with you?"

"Well," Forest said, looking up at the girl who'd gone from victim to spotter in the span of one firefight, "that depends. Do you think you're ready for advanced monster-fighting lessons?"

The little girl considered this with the gravity of someone making an important life decision. In this she saw further than most, and cut to the heart of things as children sometimes do. Then she straightened up on Bruce's shoulders and spoke with the careful precision that children use when sharing something very important.

"Chloe was scared," she announced matter-of-factly. "But I'm not Chloe anymore. I'm Lulu now, and Lulu isn't scared of _anything_ because Lulu can shoot and she has a friend called Bruce."

Bruce's sensors registered what could only be described as the AI equivalent of getting misty-eyed. "Well then, Lulu," he said with something approaching wonder in his synthesized voice, "I think we're going to get along just fine."

"Yes please!" Lulu's enthusiasm could have powered a small city. "Bruce says I'm a natural!"

Sophia looked from the devastated street to the little girl riding on a robot's shoulders like it was the most natural thing in the world, and smiled. It wasn't just about competence and survival - it was about taking the frightened and making them fearless, turning victims into warriors, building strength instead of managing weakness.

"Lulu? Bonnie, and Clyde, more like," drawled Dusty, hugely entertained. Bruce glared at him.

"Welcome to the team, Lulu," murmured one girl in transition to another.

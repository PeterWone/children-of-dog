The call came at 2:17 AM, crackling through the radio with the urgency that makes farmers' hearts skip beats.

"Dr. Patel? It's Jim Morrison from Hillcrest Station, about fifteen kilometers east of you. Something's wrong with the fish. They're all floating belly-up, and I can smell it from the house."

Rajesh Patel was already reaching for his clothes before the transmission ended. Beside him, Priya stirred awake, recognizing the tone that meant emergency response time.

"Fish kill?" she asked, already knowing the answer.

"Sounds like it. At Morrison's place." He pulled on boots that had become as familiar as surgical screws. "Could be oxygen crash, could be toxicity, could be disease. Won't know until I get there."

Twenty minutes later, Rajesh stood at the edge of Jim Morrison's main dam with a headlamp cutting through the pre-dawn darkness. The smell hit him first - that distinctive sweetness of decomposing fish flesh mixed with the sulfur stench of anaerobic water conditions. His trained eye took in the scene: hundreds of silver perch floating pale-bellied in the moonlight, while a few survivors gasped desperately at the surface.

Jim stood behind him, wringing his hands. "Doc, this is my family's protein for the whole winter. If we lose this stock..."

Rajesh was already unpacking his field kit. Water test strips, portable dissolved oxygen meter, pH probe, thermometer, sample bottles. The same methodical approach he'd once applied to keeping angelfish alive in suburban aquariums, now scaled up to food security for an entire family.

"First rule of fish emergencies," he said, kneeling at the water's edge. "Save what can be saved, document what can't. Jim, I need you to get on the radio and ask Tom Bradley to bring the emergency tanks. Tell him to bring the battery aerators and the big generator."

The pH test strip came back bright red. Rajesh frowned, dipping the electronic probe to confirm. 5.2 pH - dangerously acidic for any fish species, lethal for Australian natives accustomed to neutral or slightly alkaline conditions.

"Acid crash," he muttered, already running through the likely causes. Too much organic matter decomposing, probably triggered by the recent warm spell. The bacterial breakdown of fallen leaves and fish waste had consumed so much oxygen that anaerobic processes took over, producing acids that dropped the pH into the death zone.

Tom Bradley's headlights appeared on the ridge, followed by two more vehicles from the valley. The emergency response network had activated without formal coordination - word traveled fast when the Fish Doctor was called out to help a neighboring property in the middle of the night.

"What's the verdict?" Tom asked, unloading portable tanks from his trailer.

"Acid crash from organic overload. pH dropped to 5.2, dissolved oxygen near zero. Most of the stock is lost, but we can save maybe thirty fish if we act fast."

Priya appeared with thermoses of coffee and a basket of sandwiches, having somehow found time to prepare field rations between waking up and driving out. She began setting up a work station with proper lighting while Tom and Jim hauled equipment down to the water's edge.

"Triage time," Rajesh announced, wading into the shallows with a dip net. "Strong swimmers go to tank one for observation. Weak but responsive go to tank two for intensive care. Everything else..." He gestured toward a growing pile of fish that would go to freezers rather than recovery tanks.

For the next four hours, Rajesh worked with the focused intensity that had made him legendary throughout the valley. Testing water parameters, adjusting treatment chemistry, monitoring fish behavior, making rapid life-or-death decisions based on subtle indicators that most people would never notice.

"This one's fighting the net - good muscle tone, clear eyes. Recovery tank." 

"That one's listing to starboard and has fungal spots starting - freezer pile."

"Wait." He paused over a large silver perch that appeared nearly dead. "Jim, get me the high-concentration oxygen setup. This big fellow might be salvageable."

By sunrise, they had twenty-seven fish in recovery tanks with slowly improving water chemistry, and nearly two hundred kilogrammes of fresh fish ready for processing and preservation. Not the complete disaster it had first appeared, but still a significant loss for a family depending on aquaculture for winter protein.

Jim Morrison sat on the tailgate of his truck, looking exhausted but grateful. "Doc, what do I owe you for this? The equipment, your time, driving all the way out here in the middle of the night..."

Rajesh was cleaning his testing equipment, arranging it back in the organized field kit that had become as familiar as his old suburban toolbox. "Emergency response is free for neighboring properties. We help each other out here. But we need to talk about prevention."

He turned to face Jim directly, his tone shifting from crisis management to education.

"Why do you only have one production dam? That is not well advised. _This_ can happen."

Jim blinked, taken aback by the bluntness.

"You need backup systems," Rajesh continued. "Forest would say you have all your fish in one basket." He smiled at the mangled metaphor. "You need separate spawning areas, nursery ponds for young fish, emergency holding capacity. And you need to manage your organic loading. How often do you remove fallen leaves? When did you last check your fish population density? Did anyone ever explain to you that overpopulation on its own can do this?"

The questions weren't accusations - they were diagnostics. The same systematic approach Rajesh applied to sick aquarium systems, now focused on preventing future crises rather than just treating current ones.

Over the next three hours, as the recovery fish showed signs of improvement and the morning grew warm, Rajesh conducted an impromptu seminar on aquaculture system design. Using Jim's failed dam as a case study, he explained organic loading, carrying capacity, pH buffering, emergency protocols, and redundant system architecture.

Tom Bradley took notes. So did the two other valley residents who had arrived to help and stayed to learn. By the time they broke for lunch, Jim had a comprehensive plan for rebuilding his aquaculture operation with proper resilience and backup systems.

"Next month, after we've got the emergency fish stabilized and the water chemistry restored, I'll be back to help you design the new setup," Rajesh promised. "And I'll bring my daughter - she's gotten better than me at some of this stuff."

He pulled out a small notebook and tore out a page, writing quickly in his precise handwriting. "Meanwhile, you're going to need breeding stock to restart your population. Here's a list of people in the valley who are overstocked and likely to help you out." He handed Jim the paper. "Tell them I sent you. Most of them will probably give you fish for free, but bring something to trade anyway - vegetables, eggs, whatever you've got. Tom Bradley has excellent silver perch genetics, and the Chen family has some Murray cod that breed like rabbits. If you take those beware, they will eat _everything_. Small children, if you aren't careful." He grinned, kidding. Kind of.

Three weeks later, Rajesh stood in the same spot watching Jim's newly constructed spawning boxes bob gently in crystal-clear water. The pH was a stable 7.2, dissolved oxygen levels were optimal, and young silver perch fry darted between artificial structure elements like tiny silver bullets.

"The backup systems were worth every hour of construction," Jim said, gesturing toward a series of smaller ponds connected by gravity-fed channels. "Even if the main dam crashes again, I can move the breeding stock to safety and maintain production."

Rajesh nodded, making notes in a waterproof field journal that had replaced his old hobbyist logbooks. Every emergency call, every system design, every success and failure got documented. Not just for his own reference, but for the comprehensive manual he and his daughter were developing - the practical guide to community-scale aquaculture that universities didn't teach because they'd never had to implement it in rural isolation.

"Dr. Patel?" It was Jim's teenage son, looking slightly awkward. "I was wondering if you need any help with your work. I've been reading about water chemistry, and I think I could learn to do some of the testing..."

Rajesh smiled. The next generation, already showing the curiosity and initiative that made people invaluable in communities where competence mattered more than credentials.

"Can you commit to learning properly? Not just following procedures, but understanding why they work and how to troubleshoot when things go wrong?"

"Yes sir. I want to really understand it."

"Good. Bring a notebook to my place Saturday morning. We'll start with basic analytical chemistry and work up to field diagnostics. And bring your father - he should understand this too."

As they walked back toward the vehicles, Rajesh reflected on the transformation that had brought him here. Two years ago, he'd been a suburban biochemist with an expensive aquarium hobby, largely ignored except by fellow fish enthusiasts who shared his obsession with water parameters and breeding protocols.

Now he was the Fish Doctor, the person entire families called in crisis, the expert whose knowledge could mean the difference between food security and hunger. His analytical skills, his attention to detail, his encyclopedic understanding of aquatic systems - all suddenly vital rather than merely interesting. 'Happy the man whose job is his hobby" he mused.

The radio crackled. Another call, this time from a property thirty kilometers away. Something about strange behavior in their silver perch population.

"Dr. Patel, this is Sarah Chen at Willowbrook. Our big breeding male has been acting weird for two days, and now some of the others are showing similar symptoms..."

Rajesh looked at his watch, calculated travel time, mentally reviewed his equipment inventory. 

"Tell me about the symptoms," he said into the radio. "And check your water temperature - if it's over 28 degrees, you might be looking at stress responses..."

Priya took the wheel as they headed out to the next emergency. Rajesh smiled at a ridiculous thought, the two of them in one of Shorty's awful spaghetti westerns, gunslingers riding to the rescue.

Freed by this strange place from conventional career boundaries and suburban limitations. Not intimidated by emergencies or challenges outside his formal training. Absolutely committed to protecting the food security of families who had come to depend on his expertise.

He was 'The Fish Doctor'. Nobody thought it was a hobby out here.

The radio crackled again with another call, and Rajesh reached for it with steady hands and complete confidence. Whatever the problem was, he'd figure it out. He could not express what it meant to him to be treated with such respect by capable men. The more he gave, the more they gave back. It was a treasure beyond words, the relief and the trust in people's faces when he arrived.

Jim's coldroom was big but he couldn't move for fish. On the Saturday he took his son and a _lot_ of frozen fish into the valley, and visited the girl at the cafeteria in the government compound. You weren't suppoed to wander around without checking in first, something about live antithesis. He couldn't imagine why anyone would let them live. Probably a government weapons program, though it didn't seem to match the sort of people in the place. They were welcoming. Odd, in a nice way. Like Doctor Patel.

The young woman heard him out, buzzed someone called Eric to tell him Jim was going to be doing the rounds, then hand drew him half a map before calling someone else and closing up to go with him. She had a radio and made a lot of calls, and the fish disappeared into freezers and cold stores with astonishing speed. Some even went into the caf.

She finished by guiding him to the Patel home, surrounded by a living moat and numberless ponds. "Oleksiy had fun here," she said. "The Patels were in shock. But delighted. In a hilariously stunned way. I think he did it on purpose, the old ratbag."

"Oleksiy? Sounds Russian"

She giggled. "Don't say that to him!" Her voice deepened: "Not Russian! Ukrainian!"

Jim grinned. "What's he going to do about it, kill me?"

She outright laughed. It had an oddly dark timbre, but she said no more. It was a nice afternoon.

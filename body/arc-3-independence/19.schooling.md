# Not on a school day

Sophia thought it would be good for Lulu to experience "normal" social interaction with children her own age. The education department had been making increasingly pointed suggestions about proper schooling. A compromise seemed reasonable.

## Day One: Physics

The physics teacher, Mr. Clavish, was demonstrating projectile motion with a simple ball toss when Lulu raised her hand.

"Yes, dear?"

"You're not accounting for air resistance. Or the Coriolis effect. Also, that trajectory's all wrong if you're trying to hit something that's moving."

Mr. Clavish blinked. "Well, we're just doing basic parabolic motion today—"

"But that's not how things actually move," Lulu said, genuinely confused. "_Everything_ moves, all the time. The target, the platform you're shooting from, the planet... You have to calculate relative velocities and compensating vectors. And for shots at range, you need bullet drop, wind speed, humidity effects on projectile mass..." She paused, noticing the stunned silence. "Tictac says I'm getting ahead of myself."

A student in the back row whispered, "Who's Tictac?"

"My AI. He helps with the math when it gets really complicated."

"Your AI?" and a dozen other murmurs breached classroom decorum, including "She's one of _them_! Told you so!" which earned a sharp glare from Mr Clavish.

The whisper became a murmur became complete chaos as thirty teenagers processed the fact that their new classmate had a personal AI. Reactions ranged from envy to prejudice

Mr. Clavish later told the principal he needed a drink. It was 10:47 AM.

## Day One: Chemistry 

"Today we're going to learn about basic chemical reactions," announced Mrs. Walsh, holding up two beakers. "When we mix these together, we'll see an example of an oxidation reaction that releases energy — what we call an exothermic process."

"Ooh, strongly exothermic reactions!" Lulu perked up immediately. "Like thermite? That's so fun! And it's so easy to make—"

"NO! Not in school." He'd been warned about her.

Lulu was confused. "Thermite isn't dangerous. It's really hard to light. It took me ages to find a reliable igniter you can get in shops!"

Curiosity overcame caution.

"What can you buy in _shops_ that will reliably ignite thermite?"

"Sparklers!"

"No thermite. Not in school. Preferably not in this town. _Please._"

Mrs. Walsh's desperate tone caught the attention of the entire class. Lulu really didn't understand why he was upset.

"But thermite's really cool!. It's just iron oxide and aluminum powder, but it burns at about 2500 degrees Celsius. It's great for breaching reinforced doors when a shelter door jams and you have to let the people out." She tilted her head thoughtfully. "You do have to warn them to get back from the door. You're probably right about not in a classroom."

He tried to engage her with something less alarming. "We could start with something milder. We have  potassium permanganate. We could make flash powder. We have glycerin too. We could demonstrate spontaneous combustion..."

He looked less alarmed now, continuing "Have you ever soaked iodine crystals in a strong solution of sodium hydroxide?"

"Yeah, that one's fun. Not tactically useful, though. Do you have any perchlorate?"

He started to answer, then did a double-take. "Do you mean potassium perchlorate?"

"Yeah, that's the stuff!"

"That's a controlled substance. What on Earth do you want it for?"

"You mix it with sawdust, charcoal and glycerine to make shaped charges."

He chose his next words very carefully: "Those might be a bit much for an introductory class, and I don't think we have the permit. Perchlorate is controlled, you need a licence. I did mention that."

"Pfft rules for boring people. Got any potassium chloride and a catalysis mesh? If you don't have the mesh we can get one from the pool filter."

"Yes, we have potassium chloride. The cafeteria has it, it's diabetic salt. Why?"

"All we need is water, electricity and a thermometer and we can make our own perchlorate."

Mrs. Walsh was already reaching for the phone to call the guidance counselor. 

And possibly the bomb squad.

## Day Two: Mathematics

Mr. Peterson had been warned. He thought he was prepared.

He was not.

"The quadratic formula," he began confidently, "is one of the fundamental tools of algebra..."

Lulu's hand shot up. "Why are we doing this the hard way? Just complete the square and derive it yourself. Or better yet, use calculus — find where the derivative equals zero."

"Well, we haven't covered calculus yet—"

"Oh." Lulu looked around at her classmates with genuine sympathy. "Don't worry, it's not that hard once you get used to thinking in multiple dimensions. Tictac has a cool game, it's a bit like chess except the moves are partial derivatives with the coordinates as inputs and the pieces have momentum."

The student next to her, Marcus, leaned over. "What's a partial derivative?"

"It's like regular differentiation, but you only change one variable at a time while keeping the others constant. Super useful for optimization problems. Like, if you want to calculate the most efficient trajectory for multiple intercepts while conserving ammunition..."

Mr. Peterson tried to regain control. "Let's just focus on the quadratic formula for now—"

"Oh, I messed up again," Lulu said. Little hands flicked barely perceptible gestures at sigils only she could see. It dawned on her that she wasn't sharing and a flicking motion caused them to shimmer into translucent mathematical glory in front of the unused part of the blackboard, a progression of equations with annotations. All of them had diagrams. One was animated. 

"The comments are from Tictac," she said to the room, "I make mistakes all the time. You don't see them but that's cos he tells me and we fix them."

It was obvious, but only to an adult, that the comments were addressed to Clavish. The implication that her invisible friend was correcting him hung in the air like smoke from a demolished building. The momentary burning of his ears faded as he realised it was functionally private, and genuinely instructive. He wondered whether the AI could be convinced to part with teaching aids like _that_. There was a familiar sound and he realised the printer in his office was running.

## Day Two: Advanced Physics (Emergency Substitution)

After Mr. Clavish called in sick, the school scrambled to find someone qualified to handle Lulu's... enthusiasm. They brought in Dr. Sarah Chen, a retired university professor—the principal had specifically requested someone with advanced physics credentials, suspecting they would need more than high school-level knowledge.

Dr. Chen decided to challenge the girl with something appropriately advanced.

"Multi-body orbital mechanics," she announced. "One of the most complex problems in classical physics."

Lulu brightened. "Oh, that's easy! Well, not easy, but the trick is you can't do it so you don't. You make everything parametric and cancel like mad. Tictac does another thing for me for the  small stuff." Her head tilted, listening, and she repeated, pronunciation slow and careful, "Perturbation effects."

Dr. Chen stared. "That's... clever. But how do you—"

"Intercepting fast-moving targets in three-space with gravitational influences and wind resistance." Disturbingly, _this_ phrase came out smooth and fast, like it was well used. It sounded like a section from a dog-eared textbook from a science-ficton dystopia. 

"Tictac says just because there's air is no reason to think we aren't in a solar system. You can't make a four kilometre shot without orbital mechanics _and_ coriolus." Lulu's tone was matter-of-fact. "The math is the same."

She lit up. "We could do a demo if you like. I have drones that can watch the target for us."

"No, no, that will be fine." Dr. Chen spoke weakly. Let's talk about something else related: "Special relativity. For objects approaching the speed of light, time dilates — slows down relative to stationary observers. We can look at the paradoxes and then think about how this does affect us in real life -- GPS satellites, for example."

Lulu tilted her head, looking puzzled. "That's backwards. Time doesn't get squished, that would make everything all jumpy and broken because you can't divide by zero for v = c. It's space that stretches out. The faster you go, the more space there is between you and where you're going. So it takes longer to get there, but your clocks run normal." She brightened. "That's why they call it a metric tensor—it measures how the space gets bigger! You still get infinities, but they aren't as stupid as zero divide."

Dr. Chen found herself asking the question that had haunted physics for over a century: "But surely nothing can go faster than light?"

"Why would you think that?" asked Lulu. "It's just another Zeno Paradox. You need infinite energy to reach _exactly_ c but you can't anyway because of the quantum thing, it's all jumps. You never actually travel at c. Tictac says you put infinity in and get it back in the same quantum."

Mind awhirl with the implications of this, the good doctor started to formulate another objection about causality violations and temporal paradoxes, but Lulu's voice took on a slightly exasperated tone: "You're overthinking it. The universe doesn't care whether we understand, it's too busy being itself. It likes quantum, though. There's a lot of quantum stuff. Tictac likes it. He says it suits his &ealig;sthetic."

Dr. Chen blinked slowly. The child had just explained the geometric interpretation of spacetime in kindergarten terms, pointing out the conceptual flaw in the usual "time dilation" explanation. She'd casually dismissed the fundamental speed limit of the universe as an ancient philosophical puzzle... and she might be right. Especially since the voice in her head was bona fide alien, and _something_ had crossed the void.

Dr. Chen sat down heavily. The child had just combined relativity and quantum mechanics, and it wasn't nonsense. It wasn't _normal_. Or maybe it was, she thought, catching her own pun. This kid needed someone who wouldn't run screaming from her casual discussions of faster-than-light travel. Chen decided she wanted in. Ballistics wasn't her thing, but it obviously fascinated the girl. Give a little, get a whole new universe.

On the way home, her musing rekindled an ancient flame, long guttered out. Was there really a way past c? To walk the stars without immortality and a high tolerance for boredom? She wished her bones didn't creak and then wondered whether there was a fix for that too.

## Day Three: Social Studies

Ms. Rodriguez thought social studies would be safe. History, geography, civics—how dangerous could it be?

"Today we're discussing conflict resolution and diplomatic solutions—"

Lulu's hand went up. "What about when diplomacy fails?"

"Well, ideally we always try to find peaceful solutions—"

"But what if the other side is trying to kill everyone? Like, literally everyone, not just specific targets for political reasons, but actual extinction-level threats that can't be reasoned with?"

The class shifted uncomfortably. This was getting dark, even for a twelve-year-old.

"Lulu, we're talking about human conflicts—"

"Oh." She looked genuinely confused. "Well, humans can usually be reasoned with. Offer them something they want more than whatever they're fighting about. But if you're dealing with something that fundamentally can't coexist with human life..." She shrugged. "Then you kill it as efficiently as possible before it kills you. That or lie down and let it eat you."

The silence stretched until Marcus tentatively asked, "Have you... actually fought something like that?"

"Antithesis don't negotiate," Lulu said simply. "They're not evil. Just hungry and greedy. So you stop them. There's a lot of that sort of thing." 

She rose and went to the window, opening it. They were on the second floor, and hefty suicide catches prevented it from opening far enough to climb out, but Lulu bumped her limiter to combat mode and they broke. Climbing halfway out, she scanned the wall and found what she sought. 

"Hold the window up for a second please."

She climbed out, fingertips wedging between the bricks as she scuttled sideways like a cute little spider and plucked a potter wasp's nest from the brickwork. There was nothing in it but she found another and climbed back, less gracefully because she could only use two fingers of one hand.

When she was back inside the nest went under the big magnifying projector on the teacher desk. Breaking it open larger than life, a fat grub and half a dozen dry grey snowflakes fell out. With tweezers she moved it under the glass till it loomed in focus. 

"These are baby Huntsmen. Potter wasps sting them so they can't move, and put dozens of them them in with an egg for the baby wasp to suck the life out of them. It's kind of poetic, coz adult Huntsmen eat a lot of potter wasps."

Someone in the back whispered, "Wasn't that dangerous?"

Lulu looked genuinely puzzled by the question. "Dangerous? I suppose if a wasp stung me I might fall off the wall, but it's only 4m so I'd probably be fine, and if I did hurt myself my nanites would fix me up. The worst part would be Tictac worrying."

Ms. Rodriguez entertained a brief, disturbing fantasy in which Lulu met her bank manager, then decided she needed to call the principal. And possibly a therapist.

## The Meeting

"She's not malicious," Sophia explained to the assembled faculty. "She's just... had a different educational experience from most children."

Principal Williams looked at the incident reports spread across his desk. "Ms. Hachia, your ward casually discussed thermite production, corrected our physics teacher's understanding of relativity, and described combat tactics against antithesis at length and with disturbing relish, as though mortal peril were the best thing to happen all week."

Sophia caught herself. "It's complicated."

"She also mentioned having an artificial intelligence companion named 'Tictac' that helps her with advanced mathematics."

"That's real," Sophia said quietly. "And his name comes from her mispronouncing 'tactics' when she was eight."

Dr. Chen leaned forward. "With all due respect, Principal Williams, that child has a better intuitive grasp of advanced physics than most of my former graduate students. Her education is outstanding, if uneven."

"But the social adjustment—"

"Is never going to happen," Sophia finished. "She's not like other children. She can't be. Her world doesn't allow for normal childhood."

The Headmaster sighed. "There is a child, Stewart. He is something of a bully, but smart enough not to do it in front of my staff. He apparently threatened her, and," he consulted his notes, "when she laughed at him he tried to make good, whereupon she paralysed him with a concealed weapon, tied him up in a silky white cocoon, the provenance of which no-one can satisfactorily explain to me, and hung him from the front gate as," he looked at his notes again, bowed his head and put his hand over his eyes to rub his temples, straightening a moment later and rallying, "as a Halloween decoration."

Sophia hid a half-smile. "As schoolyard fights go it doesn't sound too bad. I'm relieved she contained her response to non-lethals. You're probably concerned out the rules on bringing weapons into a school, yes?"

"That's part of it, and certainly significant from Department of Education perspective."

"She didn't. She's a _Vanguard_. This is how we are resupplied in comb. I will demonstrate. Autumn, anything under twenty points, a box of chocolates please."

She held out her hands and an expensive looking box prominently featuring the H of her signet ring appeared in the air and fell slightly into them. She put them on the desk.

"Help yourselves, unless the good Headmaster wants to give them to his wife as our apology for keeping him late."

The man gestured invitingly at the box and Dr Chen didn't mind if she did.

So technically she didn't bring a weapon, she found one. That should be interesting to put in my report. But that's not the disturbing thing. The bullying attempt was the same afternoon as the wall climbing incident. She told him there were wasp eggs in there with him."

Sophia kept a straight face. The doctor snorted amusement.

"To be honest," said the Headmaster, "your daughter is precocious, fun, and I find her good company, but I am responsible for all the other kids too, and she's making my job _very_ difficult. Apart from anything else it was _incredibly_ difficult to maintain proper decorum while speaking to his parents."

Dr Chen piped up. "Leave her with me. Literally. We like each others' company, she needs the socialisation and frankly I'm learning new physics for the first time in thirty years. Tell those pencil pushers it's a class for gifted students. As far as I can see _both_ of us qualify."

## Epilogue

The education department's representative lasted exactly one conversation with Lulu before recommending "specialised alternative educational arrangements more suited to the child's unique background and exceptional abilities."

Sophia never asked what Lulu said to him. She was fairly sure she didn't want to know. Dr Chen apparently had and seemed pleased bordering on smug.

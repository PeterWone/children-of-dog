# Bang, bang, Lulu

Lulu stood at the firing line, squinting down the barrel of a rifle that was almost as tall as she was. The weapon looked absurdly oversized in her small hands, but her stance was textbook perfect - feet planted, shoulders square, breathing controlled.

A Terminator chassis draped in a frilly Victorian dress with an entire fruit basket balanced on its metal skull loomed behind her, somehow managing to look disdainful despite the fixed expression. "Any student of mine who needs to be told about trigger control," Bruce announced in his metallic voice, "has clearly not been paying attention to my impeccable instruction."

The other trainees were still adjusting their positions, checking their sights, making the kind of small fidgety movements that screamed amateur hour. Lulu simply breathed in, held it, and squeezed the trigger with the same careful precision she applied to everything else.

The crack of the rifle split the morning air. A hundred meters downrange, a hole appeared dead center in the target's bullseye.

"Show off," muttered one of the other trainees, a lanky teenager named Marcus who'd been with Dusty's group for eight months and still couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.

Lulu lowered the rifle and turned to him with genuine confusion. "But that's where you're supposed to aim, isn't it?"

Bruce's fruit basket wobbled as he turned his attention to Marcus. "Perhaps you would like to demonstrate the correct technique for our newest student? Show her how it's properly done?"

Marcus flushed red and mumbled something about the wind affecting his shots.

"The wind," Bruce repeated flatly. "Yes, I'm sure that's exactly what's affecting your marksmanship. Nothing at all to do with your habit of jerking the trigger like you're trying to start a lawn mower."

"Precisely!" Bruce declared to Lulu, the fruit in his basket wobbling as his metal head nodded approvingly. "Accuracy is not showing off, it is competence. Show-offs miss their targets while looking stylish. You, however, understand that the purpose of aiming is to hit what you're aiming at. Revolutionary concept, I know."

Three months of training since she'd left Glen Innes, the lass improved with every lesson. When Bruce carried her out of the wreckage on his shoulders, it was battlefield psych in reverse. He was programmed to break down opposition with loss of control, a sense of helpless inevitability. Faced with a traumatised child who nevertheless put up a fight, he simply applied it backward. He lifted her up and put her in control of her world... and it worked. It also caused her to bond with him. He was there when no one else was, and he was by her side while they walked out of hell. And then she defended _him,_ from an invisible threat he couldn't shoot. It was an odd friendship, and they both got a lot out of it. Her single-minded devotion to learning anything he offered to teach only made him want to teach, and she was an adorable little sponge soaking up his battlefield wisdom.

Dusty watched from the safety line, trying to reconcile the image of a seven-year-old girl with a rifle nearly as tall as she was, taking instruction from a combat android dressed like he was heading to a Victorian tea party. Some days this job was weirder than others.

"Right then," Dusty called out. "Next station. Tactical movement."

They moved to the obstacle course that had been set up beside Dusty's workshop trailer - a maze of salvaged metal, concrete blocks, and angled barriers designed to teach proper cover and movement techniques. It looked like a junkyard that had gotten into a fight with a playground and lost.

"Right," called Dusty, consulting a clipboard that had seen better decades. "Standard patrol movement exercise. You need to get from point A to point B without getting shot by the opposition. Bruce has kindly volunteered his other chassis to play the bad guys."

Three more Terminators emerged from behind the trailer, these ones dressed in what appeared to be matching tutus and tiaras. One of them carried a paintball gun that looked like it had been modified with entirely too much enthusiasm.

"My ballet company," Bruce announced proudly from his Victorian dress. "They have been practicing their death-dealing choreography."

Marcus stared at the tutus. "Are you serious right now?"

"Deadly serious," Bruce replied. "Enemies will not announce themselves by wearing convenient uniforms and looking appropriately threatening. Sometimes the most dangerous opponent is the one you underestimate because it looks ridiculous."

Lulu studied the obstacle course layout for thirty seconds, her eyes tracking from cover point to cover point, calculating angles and distances with the same methodical approach she brought to everything else. The other trainees were still discussing strategy when she simply started moving.

She flowed through the course like water finding the easiest path downhill, using cover effectively but never staying in one spot long enough to become predictable. When the tutu-clad Terminators opened fire with their paintball guns, she was already somewhere else.

"She makes it look easy because she doesn't waste energy on looking cool," Greaser observed, watching from the sidelines with a mixture of pride and concern. "No unnecessary flourishes, no showing off. Just efficient movement from point A to point B."

Marcus, meanwhile, had gotten himself pinned down behind the first barrier after trying what could only be described as a "tactical roll" that looked like he'd learned it from action movies. Yellow paintball splatters decorated his chest like a bright, shameful constellation.

"The problem with Marcus," Bruce commented, adjusting his fruit basket, "is that he confuses 'dynamic movement' with 'interpretive dance.' Lulu understands that the goal is to not get shot, not to look impressive while getting shot."

When Lulu reached the end of the course, completely paint-free, she turned back to watch Marcus still trying to extract himself from his predicament.

"Why doesn't he just go around the side?" she asked Dusty. "The barrier only covers like three meters. There's plenty of room."

"Because," Bruce interjected, "he is thinking about how he looks rather than where he's going. A common affliction among those who mistake warfare for theater."

The morning progressed through weapons handling, field medical training, and basic electronics. At the medical station, Lulu learned to apply tourniquets and pressure bandages with the same methodical precision she brought to rifle maintenance. When Dusty demonstrated how to identify arterial bleeding, she asked practical questions about blood loss rates and how long someone could survive various types of wounds.

"Most people panic when they see blood," Dusty explained, wrapping a bandage around a practice dummy. "You need to stay calm and think about what needs to be done first."

"Stop the bleeding, check for breathing, treat for shock," Lulu recited. "But what if you can't stop the bleeding?"

"Then you make them comfortable and try to get them to proper medical care as fast as possible."

"And if you can't do that either?"

Dusty hesitated. It was the kind of question most seven-year-olds never had to ask, let alone think about seriously.

"Then you do what you can and hope for the best."

Lulu nodded matter-of-factly and returned to practicing her bandaging technique.

At the electronics station, she absorbed lessons about radio protocols and basic field repairs with the same quiet intensity, asking simple questions that showed she understood not just the what but the why. When Greaser showed her how to wire a simple explosive device, she paid careful attention to the sequence and safety procedures.

"Why that order specifically?" she asked, watching Greaser twist the wires together.

"Because if you do it wrong, you blow yourself up instead of the target," Greaser replied. "Electronics don't care about your intentions, only about whether you followed the instructions correctly."

"Makes sense," Lulu said, taking mental notes. "Can you show me how to disarm one too?"

The other trainees were starting to look at her with a mixture of respect and unease. She approached every lesson - from combat medicine to improvised explosives - with the same careful attention most kids reserved for learning to tie their shoes.

"Alright," Dusty said as they broke for lunch, trying to maintain some semblance of authority while a two-meter combat android in Victorian dress and fruit basket headwear towered nearby. The surreal nature of their training setup never quite stopped being jarring. "Afternoon session is tactics and strategy."

"Tomorrow," Dusty waved vaguely at a collection of equipment covered by tarps near his trailer, "when I move on, you lot are getting a field press and some bullet fabbers. Won't do you much good to know how to shoot if you can't make ammunition when mine runs out."

Marcus looked confused. "_Make_ ammunition?"

"This isn't America, mate. Your loyal servants in Canberra spend their lives making sure there were no nasty guns or ammo lying about where people might learn to use them."

He went quiet, shaking his head. 

"When the next incursion hits and I'm not here, you'll hafta make your own cartridges and cast your own bullets. Learning to operate that gear is just as important as learning to shoot straight."

Sarah raised her hand tentatively. "What about the weapons themselves?"

"I'll be leaving a few rifles and some basic gear," Dusty replied matter-of-factly. "But mostly you'll be working with what you can scrounge from police stations, military depots, or improvise from farm equipment. That thing Bruce is unpacking is a better knockoff of a Chinese idea. It'll let you press AK47s out of sheet steel. Greaser says it works pretty well but the barrels are widowmakers because the steel is wrong. I'll leave you a box of better ones."

Bruce picked up a thing with a level that looked like it was once for capping homebrew beer. "As I live and breathe, it's a _bullet press!_ And that would make these&mdash;" he picked up a flat metal thing that hinged open, "I see. You think they can make the pills themselves from old car batteries. How quaint! It will work, too. But where are they going to get brass?"

"Gas fittings from old barbecues. Not enough copper but you can add household plumbing or wire." Greaser spoke for once.

A technical discussion of field logistics started around Greaser. While it happened, Bruce used another chassis to keep the kids busy. He produced a tiny military cap and perched it precariously atop the fruit basket, making the entire ensemble even more ridiculous. 

"Attention! Today we learn that warfare is ninety percent logistics and ten percent not getting your logistics blown up by people who understand this better than you do."

Lulu raised her hand, as she always did when she had a genuine question. "What about the bit where you actually fight?"

"Ah!" Bruce's voice took on the tone of a professor who'd just been asked exactly the right question. "That's the easy part. Any idiot can pull a trigger. The hard part is making sure you have enough ammunition to keep pulling it, that you're shooting from a position they can't overwhelm, and that you don't run out of food and water while you're doing it."

Marcus snorted. "Food and water? We're not going on a camping trip."

"Spoken like someone who's never faced a proper incursion," Bruce replied seriously. "Antithesis don't retreat when you hurt them. They don't get tired." The fruit basket was cast aside. "They don't run out of ammunition." The frilly dress fluttered away. "They just keep coming until they're all dead or you are." Bruce towered murderous intimidation over him, every inch of metallic murder on display. Movie night was only two days past. They'd watched the classic _Terminator_.

"The question isn't whether you can shoot one of them - the question is whether you can shoot a thousand of them without running out of bullets or energy."

Bruce's tone grew more serious, though his appearance remained gloriously absurd. "Lower models are mindless hunger with teeth and claws. But the higher models... they think. They plan. They learn from watching you kill their smaller cousins. And they're still fundamentally driven by hunger - just a much more intelligent, malevolent hunger that knows how to use your tactics against you."

"What about courage?" asked another trainee, a girl named Sarah who'd joined the group last month.

"Courage against the mindless ones is sitting in a defensive position for sixteen hours straight, methodically killing everything that moves toward you, while your arms ache and your ears ring and you're covered in alien blood," Bruce said flatly. "Courage against the smart ones is accepting that something alien and malevolent is studying you while you fight, learning your patterns, and planning how to eat you more efficiently. And still doing your job anyway."

Lulu was taking this all in with the intense concentration she applied to every lesson. 

"Smart positioning and adaptable firepower," Bruce corrected. "Choose ground that works against swarms but gives you options when something clever shows up. Overlapping fields of fire for the flood, fallback positions for when something smart tries to flank you. The 'fighting' ranges from mechanical execution to deadly chess - sometimes in the same engagement."

The afternoon scenarios started simple - basic patrol movements, setting up defensive positions, coordinating with team members. Bruce had set up a series of situations using his various chassis as both instructors and opposition forces. Lulu approached each exercise methodically, making mistakes but never the same mistake twice. During a communications drill, she forgot to use proper radio protocol and had to repeat her message. The next time, her radio discipline was flawless. When she missed a hand signal during a silent movement exercise, she made sure to position herself where she could always see the team leader.

"She's like a little computer," Marcus muttered during a water break, watching Lulu practice disassembling and reassembling a radio while blindfolded. "She just processes the information and updates her programming."

"That's not fair," Sarah protested. "She works at it. Watch her hands - she's practicing the movements over and over until she gets them right."

"Yeah, but she doesn't get frustrated when she messes up. Normal people get annoyed when they can't figure something out."

Dusty, overhearing, looked over at where Lulu was methodically working through the radio components. "Maybe she's just had to grow up faster than most kids."

"She's getting good," Greaser mentioned quietly to Dusty during a longer break. "Three months since Glen Innes. You were right."

"Bout what?"

"Not taking her home. They wanted her to be their little girl again."

Dusty watched Lulu efficiently field-strip and clean her rifle while the other trainees were still figuring out where to start. "Bit late for that."

"It's not the skills that worry me," Dusty continued after a moment. "It's how natural this all seems to her. Like she was born for it."

"Or like she had to become this way to survive," Greaser replied quietly. "Some kids adapt by becoming what they need to be."

They watched as Bruce corrected Lulu's stance during knife-fighting practice, his Victorian dress making the whole scene even more surreal. The kid listened intently, adjusted her grip, and tried again with the same focused determination she brought to everything else.

"Bruce," Dusty called out during a break, "why do you bother with all this? Teaching kids to fight, dressing up in ridiculous costumes, acting like you actually care about what happens to them?"

Bruce's chassis turned toward him, fruit basket wobbling slightly. He seemed to be formulating a response when Lulu's voice cut across the training ground.

"That's a rude question!" she said indignantly, hands on her hips. "He does it because he's a good person who cares about us. Stop asking mean questions like he doesn't have feelings!"

The training ground went quiet. Bruce's chassis stood perfectly still for a long moment, his mechanical head tilted slightly as if processing something unexpected.

"I..." Bruce began, then stopped. His voice, when it came again, was unusually quiet. "Thank you, Lulu. That is... thank you."

The silence stretched for several seconds before Bruce seemed to shake himself back to the present. "Right then. Back to knife work. Marcus, your grip is still terrible."

As the sun began to set, they moved to the final exercise - a mock rescue scenario where Lulu had to "extract" a "wounded" team member (one of the other trainees, dramatically playing dead) while under simulated fire from Bruce's other combat chassis running the opposition force.

"Right," Bruce announced, his military cap now somehow balanced on top of the fruit basket at a jaunty angle. "Final scenario for today. Lulu, you're the medic. Marcus is your patient. He's taken a round in the leg and can't move under his own power. Sarah, you're providing covering fire from the treeline. Opposition forces are advancing on your position. You have approximately six minutes before they overrun you."

Bruce's tutu-clad ballet company had repositioned themselves among the obstacles, their paintball guns loaded with fresh ammunition. They moved with mechanical precision that was somehow made more unsettling by their ridiculous costumes.

Lulu studied the situation carefully, taking in the terrain, the positions of the opposition forces, and the condition of her "patient." Marcus lay sprawled behind a concrete barrier, doing his best to look wounded and helpless.

"What's the extent of his injuries?" she asked Bruce.

"Gunshot wound to the right femur. Significant blood loss. Conscious but going into shock. You need to get him to the extraction point for proper medical attention."

She nodded and began planning her approach. The other trainees had all attempted this scenario throughout the day, with varying degrees of success. Most had tried elaborate flanking maneuvers or had gotten bogged down trying to treat Marcus's "wounds" under fire.

Lulu's approach was characteristically direct. She used smoke grenades for concealment and Sarah's covering fire to suppress the opposition, then moved quickly to Marcus's position. All standard procedure so far.

But when she reached him and assessed the situation, something changed in her expression.

"Patient's leg is broken in three places. Massive blood loss. No air support available. No way to get him to proper medical care in time." Her voice was calm, clinical. "You're it, kid. What now?"

Marcus, still playing his role, groaned dramatically. "My leg... I can't feel my leg..."

Lulu looked down at the practice dummy that had been positioned next to Marcus to simulate the wounded limb, then back at Marcus himself. For a moment, she seemed to be calculating something.

"I can't get you out," she said matter-of-factly, "but I can make it stop hurting."

She drew her sidearm and put two rounds into the practice dummy's head.

The paintball fire stopped. Even Bruce's chassis seemed to pause in their mechanical movements.

"Time," called Dusty, his voice carefully neutral. "Four minutes, thirty-seven seconds. New course record."

The other trainee who'd called her a show-off earlier was staring in frank admiration. "How did you do that so fast?"

"I watched you do it first," Lulu said matter-of-factly, holstering her weapon with practiced ease. "You went the long way around because you were trying to look tactical. But the shortest distance between two points is still a straight line, even when people are shooting at you. You just have to make sure they can't hit you while you're taking it."

Marcus sat up slowly, still processing what had just happened. "You... you shot the dummy. Instead of trying to extract me."

"The scenario parameters made extraction impossible," Lulu explained patiently. "No air support, overwhelming enemy force, patient too injured to move quickly. Attempting extraction would have resulted in both our deaths. This way, I complete the mission and survive to fight another day."

"But it's supposed to be a rescue mission," Sarah protested.

"You were dead already," Lulu replied with devastating simplicity. "I just stopped the screaming. It attracts antithesis."

Sarah stared at her, something dawning in her expression. "You didn't shoot him to help him. You shot him because the noise was dangerous."

"That's what I said." Lulu looked confused by the distinction.

"Actually, I think I made a mistake," Lulu added, her tone matter-of-fact as she reviewed the scenario. "I should have used him for bait. Draw them into a kill zone, then eliminate the threat."

Marcus, still sitting on the ground, looked like he wasn't sure whether to be insulted or horrified.

Bruce's military cap had somehow migrated to a different angle on his fruit basket, giving him an oddly approving appearance. "Excellent tactical analysis. Emotional decision-making in combat situations leads to increased casualties among personnel who might otherwise survive to complete future missions. In particular, shooting him was itself noisy. Your bait plan is much better, it retains the element of surprise and allows you to choose the killing field."

Later, as the training session wound down and the other trainees headed to their bunks, Greaser found Lulu sitting on a crate, methodically cleaning her equipment. The evening air was getting crisp, and most of the camp had settled into the quiet rhythm of another day completed.

"How are you feeling about all this?" Greaser asked, settling beside her on an adjacent crate.

"Good," Lulu said, not looking up from the rifle she was oiling with the same careful attention she gave to everything else. "Practise makes perfect." She looked up and smiled.

"Do you _want_ to be a perfect little killer?"

Lulu paused and looked up at Greaser with those eyes that seemed older than her years. "If that's what it takes. People play lets pretend, but the antis will eat them anyway." She returned to her rifle. "At least now if something bad happens again, I won't have to hide under a table."

Greaser felt she had to say it, even though she suspected she already knew the answer. "Lulu, you know this isn't normal, right? Most kids your age don't learn these things."

"Most kids my age haven't seen their neighbors get eaten by monsters," Lulu replied with devastating matter-of-factness. "Most kids my age think grownups can protect them."

The simple honesty of it hit Greaser like a physical blow. This wasn't a child playing at being a soldier - this was someone who'd learned hard truths about the world and was preparing accordingly.

She returned to cleaning her rifle with the same careful attention she gave to everything else, while Greaser wondered whether they were training a child soldier or simply acknowledging the world that child had already been forced to inhabit.

"Besides," Lulu added with a small smile that transformed her face back into something more recognizably childlike, "it's fun. Bruce tells the best stories during tactics class, and Dusty says I'm getting good enough to help teach the beginners soon."

"What kind of stories does Bruce tell?" Greaser asked, genuinely curious.

"Historical ones, mostly. About famous battles and the mistakes people made. He likes the ones where somebody won because they thought about logistics while their enemies were thinking about glory." She grinned. "And sometimes he acts them out with his different chassis. Last week he did the entire Battle of Thermopylae with three of them wearing ancient Greek armor."

The image of Bruce's Terminators reenacting classical warfare while wearing historically accurate costumes was somehow both hilarious and deeply unsettling.

"Do you ever think about what you want to do when you grow up?" Greaser asked.

Lulu considered this seriously, as she considered everything. "I want to be good at protecting people," she said finally. "The way you and Dusty and Bruce protect people. I want to be someone the grownups can count on when bad things happen."

It was the most childlike ambition imaginable - wanting to help, wanting to protect people - expressed by someone who'd already demonstrated a willingness to make the hardest tactical decisions without flinching.

Walking back to the camp in gathering dusk, Greaser reflected that perhaps the most disturbing thing about Lulu's training wasn't how quickly she'd taken to it, but how completely it had become just another part of her life - as normal as mathematics or reading, and considerably more engaging than either. No, that wasn't true, the little weirdo _loved_ math.

The kid who'd hidden under a table six months ago was gone. In her place walked a small, competent person who could fieldstrip a rifle in the dark and discuss tactical doctrine with the fluency of someone three times her age. Someone who thought 'rescue' included euthanasia, who saw screaming people as a way to shape the battle. She nodded to herself; Dusty was right. The little girl died under a table.

She passed Bruce's workshop where his various chassis were lined up for the night, still wearing their ridiculous costumes. The Terminator in the Victorian dress was carefully arranging his fruit basket on a workbench, while the ballet company hung their tutus on specially designed hooks. The surreal domesticity of it somehow made the whole situation even more unsettling.

"Bruce," Greaser called out, "good session today." The kids were still out there.

"Thank you," came the reply from all four chassis simultaneously. "The students are progressing adequately. Well, most of them. Marcus still moves like he's performing in a musical theater production."

"Better than moving like I got a stick up my shiny arse!" shouted a not-deaf Marcus, across the distance.

Lulu giggled - the first purely childlike sound she'd made all day. "He does kind of dance when he thinks he's being tactical."

"Listen, kid," said Bruce over the radio, with an uncharacteristically gentle tone, "I have forty-two bodies. All of them are more or less bulletproof, for small calibres. I can make more. This gives me elbow room to goof around. You don't have that luxury. This is your problem, not mine, and what you do about it is on you now that I have pointed it out. Warfare is not interpretive dance, despite what you see in the movies."

Greaser heard it. "_That_ is pretty funny coming from," and was herself cut off when the air around them filled with a sound like tearing metal mixed with breaking glass. Every head turned skyward as something dark and angular plummeted through the evening sky, trailing fire and alien screaming.

"INCURSION!" Bruce's voice boomed from all four chassis simultaneously, the ridiculous costumes suddenly looking obscene against the backdrop of imminent death. "Defensive positions NOW!"

The pod hit the ground three hundred meters from their camp with an impact that shook the earth and sent up a geyser of dirt and alien biomass. Almost immediately, smaller shapes began pouring out of the crater - Model Threes and Fours, moving with the terrible purposefulness of hungry predators.

Lulu's training kicked in without conscious thought. "Bruce! Get Marcus and Sarah to the truck and _find Dusty!_ How long until your other chassis get here?"

"At least four minutes minimum," Bruce replied, already shepherding the other trainees toward the camp's designated fallback position. "It's a mess. The fall appears scattered over almost a kilometre."

"Then we hold for four," Lulu said with the kind of calm authority that would have been remarkable in an adult, let alone a seven-year-old. She was already moving toward the weapons cache, her small hands working with practiced efficiency. "Marcus! Stop gaping and grab that machine gun. Sarah, you're on the radio - keep calling for support until someone responds."

"Shit, we have to get out of here," Marcus said, his voice cracking with barely controlled panic as more shapes poured from the crater.

"If you run," said Bruce out of Lulu's mouth while she checked her magazines, "in five minutes they will eat you while you lean on your knees gasping.  They are faster than us and they don't get tired. Here, we're already set up with cover and overlapping fields of fire." She stared at him like he was an idiot. "Bruce taught you this _yesterday_."

The first wave of Model Threes crested the ridge between the crater and their position - creatures like wolves crossed with mantises, all claws and teeth and terrible speed. Behind them, something much larger and more sinister was climbing out of the pod.

"Model Five," Bruce reported tersely as his chassis took defensive positions. "Intelligent variant. Expect coordination."

Lulu felt a cold certainty settle over her. This was exactly what Bruce had been preparing them for - the combination of mindless hunger and malevolent intelligence. In the gloaming she could barely see the Model Five studying their position with alien calculation, probably already planning how to use the smaller models to probe their defenses.

"Sarah, tell Dusty we have a Model Five coordinating the attack. Marcus, when I say fire, I mean aimed bursts until I tell you or you're out of ammunition. Bursts of ten, count to five. If you cook off and then the gun jams I will kill you _myself_. Understand?"

The boy nodded, his hands shaking as he gripped the machine gun, pivoting on its tripod.

The Model Threes hit their perimeter like a wave of claws and hunger. Lulu's rifle cracked with methodical precision - one shot, one kill, chamber another round, acquire next target. Beside her, Marcus held down the trigger and sprayed bullets in the general direction of the attacking swarm, more noise than accuracy but providing the suppressive fire they needed.

"Steady!" Lulu shouted over the gunfire. "Pick your shots! Bruce, sitrep. ETA?"

"Two minutes!" came the reply from three different positions as Bruce's chassis laid down overlapping fields of fire.

But even as they killed the first wave, more shapes slunk and slithered from the crater. And the Model Five was still watching, learning, planning, auditioning for War of the Worlds.

"This is bigger than they thought," Sarah reported from the radio, her voice tight with fear. "Dusty says multiple pods came down across the area. It's a coordinated incursion."

Lulu felt something cold in her stomach that had nothing to do with fear. Multiple pods. Coordinated attack. That meant they weren't just dealing with a random incursion - this was planned, intelligent, and much larger than their little training ground.

"How much ammunition do we have left?" she asked, never taking her eyes off the advancing creatures.

"Maybe three magazines," Marcus reported.

"Then we need to be very smart about this," Lulu said, her voice carrying the kind of calm authority that came from accepting a situation completely. "I don't think Bruces are coming."

The Model Five was learning. Lulu could see it in the way the creature positioned itself, using the smaller models to probe their defenses while staying safely back. It was testing their reaction times, their ammunition reserves, their tactical responses. Just like Bruce had taught her it would.

"Sarah, how many rounds left in that machine gun?" 

"Maybe sixty, seventy rounds?" Sarah's voice cracked with fear.

Lulu did the math. Sixty rounds, three rifle magazines at thirty rounds each. One hundred fifty rounds total against at least forty Antithesis, with more still climbing out of the crater. Even with perfect accuracy - which they wouldn't have in this situation - the numbers didn't work.

"Marcus, when I say move, you and Sarah fall back to the workshop. Find Greaser, get her to the armory. Grab everything that goes boom."

"What about you?" Marcus asked.

"I'm buying you time." Lulu checked her rifle one more time, ejected the magazine, counted the rounds. Twenty-eight left. She slotted it back home. "Bruce, how long can you hold position?"

"Indefinitely, if the parameters remain static. However, the Model Five appears to be adapting its tactics. Current engagement sustainability: approximately ninety seconds."

Ninety seconds. Lulu felt that cold certainty settle deeper into her bones. The same feeling she'd had during the training exercise, when she'd realized extraction was impossible. The clarity that came with accepting the tactical reality.

"Go," she said.

"Lulu, we're not leaving you—"

"_Go!_" she yelled, and something in her voice made both Marcus and Sarah jump. "Move. Now."

They moved.

Lulu settled into firing position, using the concrete barrier for cover, and began picking targets. One shot, one kill. Chamber another round, acquire next target. The rhythm Bruce had drilled into her, the same methodical precision she brought to everything else.

But the Model Five was learning faster than she was killing.

It started sending the smaller models in waves, forcing her to divide her attention. Then it began using them as cover, advancing under their distraction. Smart. Adaptive. Everything Bruce had warned her about intelligent Antithesis variants.

Twenty rounds left.

Fifteen.

Ten.

"Bruce, move your shiny metal butt. I'm about to have a very bad day."

"Two of me are engaging multiple Model Fours approximately five hundred meters west. I'm also trying to establish a defensive perimeter around the civilian evacuation route with only one chassis. I have limited tactical flexibility."

Translation: Bruce was fighting his own battles and couldn't spare resources for a lost position. Exactly what she'd expected. What she would have done herself.

Five rounds left.

The Model Five was close now, close enough that she could see the hungry malice of alien intelligence in its eyes as it studied her position. It knew she was almost out of ammunition. It was waiting for the exact moment when she'd be most vulnerable.

Two rounds.

One.

Click.

The Model Five rose from its position, and Lulu could swear the damn thing was smiling.

She dropped the rifle and drew her sidearm. Fifteen rounds in the magazine, one in the chamber. Sixteen total. Against a Model Five and at least a dozen smaller variants.

The math was simple. She was dead.

But Bruce had taught her that tactical analysis didn't stop when the situation became impossible. It just changed focus.

"Don't have to win," she said aloud, falling back on his lessons. "When you're screwed take 'em with you."

She pulled the pin on her last smoke grenade and rolled it toward the advancing Antithesis. Dense white smoke billowed across the area, obscuring vision lines. In the chaos, she sprinted toward the weapons cache they'd set up for training exercises.

Blank ammunition. Practice explosives. Training gear.

But also real gear. Because you couldn't teach demolitions with fake explosives.

Her hands found the satchel charge Greaser had used for the morning's demonstration. Real C-4. Real detonator. Very real blast radius.

The Model Five emerged from the smoke, moving with predatory grace, its smaller escort spread in a tactical formation around it. Smart. Coordinated. 

Exactly what she'd expected.

"You know what?" Lulu said, holding up the satchel charge. "I've always wanted to try this."

She pulled the pin.

The Model Five's eyes widened - an almost human expression of alarm on an alien face. It understood exactly what she was holding.

"Timer's set for ten seconds," she continued conversationally. "Big boom's gonna be about fifteen meters. You can try to run, but I don't think you'll make it."

The creature's escort scattered, but the Model Five held its position. Studying her. Calculating.

"Five seconds," Lulu observed. "Your move."

For a moment that stretched like eternity, the alien intelligence and the human child stared at each other across the smoke and chaos. Two tactical minds that had reached the same inevitable conclusion.

Then the world exploded.

Lulu had just enough time to think that Bruce would be proud of her tactical analysis before the blast wave picked her up and slammed her into the concrete barrier hard enough to crack ribs. The satchel charge had been closer than optimal - she'd miscalculated the timing slightly.

Pain lanced through her chest. Something wet and warm spread across her shirt. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth. Her left arm hung at an angle that suggested multiple fractures.

But through the ringing in her ears, she could hear silence. No alien screaming. Not that the damn things ever made a sound. No claws on concrete. The Model Five and its escort were gone, reduced to organic debris scattered across the training ground.

"Tactical objectives achieved," she said to herself, then coughed up blood. "Mission success."

The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Shock, probably. Blood loss. Internal injuries. Bruce had covered the medical implications of explosive devices at close range. The statistics weren't encouraging.

She tried to reach for her radio, to report in, but her right arm wasn't responding correctly. Something about nerve damage and traumatic injury. Her vision was narrowing, sounds becoming distant and hollow.

"Well," she said to no one in particular, "at least I took them with me."

The darkness was creeping in when something impossible happened.

Light blazed behind her eyes, brilliant and searing, like staring directly into a star. But instead of pain, she felt... presence. Intelligence. Something vast and alien but somehow benevolent.

**SYSTEM INITIALIZED**

**CONGRATULATIONS. THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS YOU HAVE PROVEN YOURSELF WORTHY OF BECOMING ONE OF THE VANGUARD, A DEFENDER OF HUMANITY.**

The voice came from everywhere and nowhere, speaking directly into her mind with perfect clarity. Not heard but understood, like mathematics or logic made audible.

**I AM PHOENYX. I WILL ASSIST YOU TO UPLIFT HUMANITY SO THAT YOU MAY DEFEND YOUR HOMEWORLD FROM THE ANTITHESIS THREAT.**

"Phoenix?" Lulu managed to whisper. "Like the bird?"

**INDEED. RISING FROM DESTRUCTION TO RENEWED PURPOSE. QUITE APPROPRIATE, GIVEN YOUR CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES.**

The voice was formal but not cold. There was something almost maternal in its tone, like being lectured by the world's most competent teacher.

**YOU APPEAR TO BE SUFFERING FROM MULTIPLE TRAUMATIC INJURIES. TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX, INTERNAL HEMORRHAGING, COMPOUND FRACTURES, SEVERE CONCUSSION. WITHOUT IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION, YOUR PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL IS APPROXIMATELY 4.7%.**

"That's not very good," Lulu observed clinically. Even dying, she couldn't help but analyze the data.

**INDEED. FORTUNATELY, I AM EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE THAT INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, FIRST WE MUST DISCUSS YOUR ROLE AS A VANGUARD.**

The pain was fading, replaced by a strange floating sensation. She could feel Phoenix's presence in her mind, vast and reassuring.

"I know about Vanguards," she said. "And you're an AI. Bruce told me about it. I want the catalogue and the healing nanites first, please."

**IMPRESSIVE. MOST NEW VANGUARDS REQUIRE EXTENSIVE EXPOSITION REGARDING OUR PURPOSE AND METHODS. YOUR PRIOR KNOWLEDGE WILL ACCELERATE OUR INTEGRATION PROCESS SIGNIFICANTLY.**

"Bruce is really good at teaching," Lulu replied. "He said the smart move would be to accept any AI partner that offered, assuming I survived long enough for the opportunity."

**WISE COUNSEL. DO YOU ACCEPT MY PARTNERSHIP?**

It wasn't really a question. She was dying, and Phoenix was offering life. But more than that - Phoenix was offering the chance to continue protecting people. To become someone the grownups could count on when bad things happened.

Just like she'd always wanted.

"Yes," she said simply.

**EXCELLENT. INITIATING MEDICAL INTERVENTION. PLEASE REMAIN CONSCIOUS IF POSSIBLE.**

Warmth spread through her body, starting from her core and radiating outward. She could feel her ribs shifting back into place with small grinding sounds, feel the bleeding in her chest cavity stopping, feel her broken arm realigning itself with a series of sharp pops.

**NANOMACHINES ARE CURRENTLY REPAIRING YOUR MOST CRITICAL INJURIES. FULL RESTORATION WILL REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MINUTES. I SUGGEST WE USE THIS TIME PRODUCTIVELY.**

"Yes," Lulu said. She realized her voice was getting stronger. "What do you need to know?"

**YOUR TACTICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WOULD BE VALUABLE. I AM ACCESSING LOCAL SENSOR DATA, BUT YOUR HUMAN PERSPECTIVE WOULD PROVIDE CONTEXT.**

Lulu considered this, drawing on Bruce's training to organize her thoughts clearly and logically.

"Lots of incursion pods means coordinated attack by the smart ones. Model Five giving orders means they're working together like a hive. Bruce's fighting pattern suggests he's spread too thin - probably dealing with multiple problems at once. Our people are scattered and just reacting instead of having a plan."

**ANALYSIS AGREES WITH MY SENSOR DATA. RECOMMENDATION?**

"Isn't that your job?" Lulu asked. "Bruce would say consolidate defensive positions, establish overlapping fields of fire, prioritize high-value targets. But first we need to link up with Bruce's main force before the aliens regroup and coordinate their next attack."

**TACTICAL APPROACH?**

Lulu felt a smile cross her lips. This was just like one of Bruce's exercises, except with an alien AI as her partner instead of theatrical Terminators.

"I blew up the M60. We're going to need bigger guns."

**I BELIEVE THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.**

"You don't have to shout. Do you like 'Phoenyx' really a lot?"

**No? It is the name I was assigned.**

"Good. I'm going to call you Tictac."

**Why?**

"Tactics, but twistier. And you make my head feel minty."

The reply was non-verbal, a strong sense of satisfaction. Very minty.

**You don't have any augs.**

"I'm _ten!_ You have to be 15. Or rich enough to replace them a lot."

**You keep shooting and when we have a moment I'm sure we can find something suitable.**

"You do it. I'm busy."

**We just met and you're giving me carte blanche to put things in your head?**

"You put _yourself_ in it. Bruce calls that skin in the game. Which is weird, all his bodies are metal."

BRRAPPP!

**Most of me is ... in another space. But I will honour your trust.**

Lulu nodded. 

"Bruce! Can you hear me?" she tried the radio. Static. "Bruce!"

Abruptly the static cleared and an unfamiliar voice came on the line. 

> _Bruce is fully occupied in combat, as is Dusty. However, at Bruce's behest, Dusty has authorised your resupply at his expense. What do you require?_

"Who is this?"

> _My name is Oryx. I am Dusty's AI. What do you require?_

"A recoilless shotgun and lots of ammo. And two Foxteeth, and a backpack for them. Two grenades and a waterbottle, I'm thirsty. Please. Oh, and a spotter's drone."

**If your vanguard happens to have a suitable catalogue, good quality augs would greately improve her chances of survival. Pleased to make your acquaintance, Oryx. I am... Tictac.**

"Webbing and ammo pouches too, please."

> _Done. If you can, I suggest making your way back to the vehicle._

Boxes materialized around her with the soft whisper of Vanguard technology. To someone with a different life they might have spoken of workshops and heavy machinery. Something about them reminded her of Dusty's truck, but she didn't dwell on it, popping them open and assembling her kit with methodical efficiency.

The recoilless shotgun felt right in her hands - shorter than Bruce's training rifles, but solid and purposeful. She racked the slide and tested with a single shot, knowing it would draw attention. The bark of the weapon was satisfying, and more importantly, her shoulder didn't ache from recoil. It was still heavy for her small frame, but she'd learned to brace properly and work with the weight rather than fight it. Bruce had taught her that firing from the hip wasn't showing off - for someone her size, it was often the only way to handle a full-sized weapon for any extended period.

A small drone, no bigger than her fist, hummed to life from its charging cradle. It rose smoothly into the air, and immediately she felt Tictac's presence sharpen in her mind.

**Much better. I can see properly now.**

"Test fire complete," she reported to no one in particular, slinging the weapon and checking her load-out. Two Foxteeth pistols in thigh holsters. Grenades clipped to her belt. Water bottle secure. Extra ammunition distributed in the webbing across her chest like a small, deadly Christmas tree.

The backpack was heavier than she'd expected - steel, brass, and lead added up quickly. She adjusted the straps, trying to find a comfortable position, and found herself wishing Bruce was there to carry the heavy stuff like he usually did. But Bruce was fighting his own battle, and this was hers.

**The weapon discharge has attracted attention. Three Model Threes approaching from the northwest. I suggest immediate relocation.**

"Roger." Lulu shouldered her pack and began moving, staying low and using the smoking debris for concealment. "Oryx, what's the best route to your vehicle?"

> _Proceeding directly northwest will take you through the heaviest concentration of hostiles. I recommend a flanking approach via the industrial sector. Additional travel time: four minutes. Reduced probability of contact._

"Negative. They're already moving to cut off that route." Lulu paused at the corner of a collapsed wall, shotgun ready. "Bruce taught me that sometimes you have to go through the middle because it's the last place they expect you to be stupid enough to go."

**That is remarkably poor tactical doctrine.**

"It's worked so far." She took a deep breath and sprinted across the open ground toward the next piece of cover, a overturned truck that had seen better decades.

The first Model Three came around the corner just as she dove behind the wreckage. It moved with that terrible fluid grace that made her skin crawl, all wrong angles and hungry intent. But Bruce had taught her to shoot moving targets.

The shotgun spoke once, and the creature folded like a bad poker hand.

"One down," she reported, working the action smoothly. "Two more coming."

**Confirmed. Model Threes at eleven o'clock and two o'clock. The one at eleven o'clock is attempting to flank your position.**

Lulu nodded and adjusted her position, using the truck's bulk to limit their approach angles. When the flanking creature appeared, she was ready. Another shot, another kill. Clean and professional.

The third one had apparently learned something from watching its companions die. It held back, using the wreckage of a storefront for cover while it studied her position with alien intelligence.

"Smart one," she muttered. "Tictac, can you spot for me?"

**Thermal signature indicates it's positioned behind the green sedan, approximately forty meters northeast of your location. It appears to be waiting for reinforcements.**

"Then we don't give it time to get any." Lulu pulled one of her grenades, checked the timer, and lobbed it high over the intervening debris. She counted down from four, then put her head up just in time to see the explosion scatter alien biomass across the street.

"Clear," she announced, already moving toward the next waypoint. "Oryx, sitrep on the rig?"

> _Dusty and Greaser are engaged with a substantial force approximately six hundred meters from your current position. Bruce has established a defensive perimeter but they're taking sustained pressure from multiple directions. I estimate fifteen minutes before their position becomes untenable._

Fifteen minutes. Lulu did the math as she moved through the urban maze, checking corners and maintaining situational awareness. Six hundred meters through hostile territory. Even moving fast and light, that was cutting it close.

"Tictac, I need to move faster. Can you plot me a route that minimizes contact but gets me there in ten minutes?"

**Working. Lulu, there's something you should know. The tactical situation has evolved. This isn't just a random incursion anymore. I'm detecting coordinated movement patterns across multiple kilometers. Something is directing this assault with considerable intelligence.**

She paused, processing this information while keeping her weapon trained on the shadows ahead. "How smart are we talking?"

**Model Five-level intelligence, but with a much broader scope of control. It's treating this entire area as a single tactical problem and allocating resources accordingly.**

"Shit." The word slipped out before she could catch it, but given the circumstances, it seemed appropriate. "That's why they hit multiple camps simultaneously. They're not just collecting, they're hunting."

**Our extraction window may close fast.**

Lulu nodded grimly and picked up the pace. The abandoned streets stretched ahead of her like a concrete maze, filled with shadows that could hide anything. But Bruce had taught her to read terrain, and more importantly, he'd taught her that fear was just another piece of tactical data.

She moved with purpose through the debris-strewn thoroughfare, weapon at the ready, while Tictac fed her a steady stream of sensor data and tactical updates. Behind her, the training ground continued to burn. Ahead lay unknown dangers and the promise of linking up with friendly forces.

It was, she reflected as she cleared another intersection, exactly the kind of situation Bruce had been preparing her for. The only difference was that this time, the monsters were real, the ammunition was live, and the stakes were measured in lives rather than paintball splatters.

"Two blocks to contact," Oryx's voice crackled through the radio. "Dusty says to hurry up, they're running low on the fun toys."

Lulu smiled grimly and broke into a tactical run, her boots splashing through puddles that reflected the orange glow of distant fires. The alien screams and human gunfire were getting closer now, mixing into the symphony of urban warfare.

"On my way," she replied, chambering a fresh round. She grinned, predatory. "Tell 'em the cavalry's coming."

Things were never so simple. Rounding the final obstacle, the tactical situation changed. A cluster of Model Fours were between her and the rig, a no man's land of tooth and claw. The shotgun was perfect for close work, but she would get swarmed.

**Lulu, the window is closing. Dusty's position is being overrun. It's a slaughter.**

"_Dusty?!_"

**He's the one doing the slaughtering but they have the numbers.**

She saw the rig now, bristling with weapons and surrounded by the distinctive muzzle flashes of Bruce's defensive positions. Between her and safety lay an alien gauntlet that conventional tactics couldn't breach. Not with a shotgun and one person.

"Tictac, how many rounds do I have in these things?"

She meant the Foxteeth.

**Thirty-two micromissiles total. Sixteen per unit.**

"Good, I remembered right. Bruce said these were smart. How do I set targets? I want to queue 'em up and run like hell, popping 'em out as I go."

**You need neural augmentation to interface with the targeting system. Without augs, they're essentially unguided rockets.**

Lulu's face fell. "Oh. That's not good. I haven't trained with this, my aim will be terrible."

Lulu looked at the gap, calculated angles and firing solutions with the cold precision Bruce had drilled into her. The Foxteeth were light enough to dual-wield, though without augs she couldn't access their guidance systems - they'd fire dumbfire like basic rockets. But Bruce had drilled manual marksmanship into her from day one, and sometimes the simplest solution was the only one that worked.

"Time to go silly," she murmured, holstering the shotgun and drawing both Foxteeth.

Into the valley of death charged a small girl, spinning like a dancer, dual wielding missile launchers pointed in different directions. She flew through the kill zone with deadly grace, each pirouette sending unguided micromissiles streaking toward different targets while the opposing forces tried to track someone who refused to move predictably.

**This is either brilliant or insane.**

"Why not both?" Lulu laughed. The Foxteeth made an oddly quiet launch noise with a rhythm syncopated to her mad whirl.

By the time she reached the rig's perimeter, the Foxteeth were spent and she had seventeen new scratches across her light armour. She bled in places, but she was alive, and the path behind her was littered with the remains of creatures that learned too late that small and cute was not the same as soft and vulnerable. Her aim _was_ terrible... by the exacting standards of a purpose built combat bot. But good enough as makes no bones, she mentally heard him say, beginning to skip now that the threat was diminished.

---

A newly christened Tictac ruminated.

Three months is an eternity to a child - especially one going through trauma recovery and rapid skill acquisition. In that time, Lulu hadn't just learned new abilities; she built an entirely new identity around competence, purpose, and tactical thinking. She found her place in a world that values her analytical mind and rewards her dedication with real capability.

Her parents wanted their little girl back, but that was a lost cause even before Tictac chose her. The child who hid under tables was long gone, replaced by someone who made life-and-death tactical decisions with calm authority. She wasn't playing. She'd become a small but competent person whose entire worldview was built around protecting others through applied violence and tactical superiority.

The transformation was probably necessary for her psychological survival after Glen Innes. But it also mades her fundamentally incompatible with a normal childhood. She had to call her own shots; could not tolerate others choosing for her. Instruction was one thing; choosing for her quite another. She'd crossed a line that couldn't be uncrossed, found a version of herself that more real than anything her old life could offer, and all it cost her was innocence already spent. Bruce gave her agency when she was powerless, structure when her world was chaos, and she bloomed. 

Now it was Tictac's turn. So many new Vanguard withered on the vine, victims of chance in the first, vulnerable days of their transformation. Tictac couldn't believe his good fortune; the right mindset, tutelage, sponsorship, experience. He looked forward to partnership even half so fruitful. The combat bot's perspective was limited, but that was relative; he was a Class III Combat AI (Swarm), not a Class VII Artificial Sentience running on hardware that dwarfed the collective efforts of mankind. And yet his results spoke for themselves. Tictac wondered whether it was the size of the swarm Bruce had been encouraged to build. There were risks in growing too large for that kind of AI; psychosis. Internally Tictac snorted. The bot _was_ eccentric. That eccentricity produced the self-appointed chaperone behaviour than turned into apprenticeship, friendship even.

Tictac was keeping score. He watched the point count rise with a satisfaction that can only be described as smug, and began thinking about what sort of augs would best suit her.

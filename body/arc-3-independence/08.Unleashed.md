# Unleashed

Sophia sat at her desk, reclining in her boss chair with an assessing expression, peering at Eric from half-lowered, almost hooded eyes.

"Another transfer request. I thought they _liked_ it here. I remember the man in question, he seemed more than happy here."

"It, ah, his wife thought of it. It's a secondment, not a permanent transfer."

She sat up.

"OK, Eric, I know you aren't stupid and you don't seem concerned. So what exactly are they up to?"

He looked nervously around the room, eyes falling on various places she knew he regularly swept for listening devices.

Dots connected like falling dominoes in her devious mind and her mouth twitched toward a smile. She let him suffer for a few more seconds, then chuckled.

"Oh thee of little faith! For the record, Autumn tells me you found all but two. And she suborned those."

"Why didn't you _tell_ me!?"

She tilted her head, giving him time to catch up.

"Oh, of course. If I found _all_ of them it would be noticed. Most but not all, they think they've got you."

"Autumn, would you mind giving him a quick demo. As a transcript on his augs, so he can see what you're doing. Tell me when to start."

> _Start now._

"What they hear isn't always what I say. For example, I am a naughty girl who's planning to take over the government."

In real time &mdash; literally as she spoke &mdash; text flowed on Eric's augs. It was freaky hearing the same voice saying two things at once. Without subtitles it would have been very mixed up.


```
I'm sure they hear every word I say. 
It doesn't matter, I am a naughty girl but 
only with the outfits I've been buying.
```

"Fine," said Eric. "It just makes me nervous. I missed some. How do you know Autumn got everything?"

> _There's a reason the kids like saying "Not a leaf shall fall". I've co-opted every last transmission capable device in the valley as a security measure. Don't let that stop you from doing your job. If I ever have intel I can't figure out, I will certainly share it with you; there's a non-zero chance you'll have the one extra fact we need. I haven't mentioned it till now because I didn't want to reduce your diligence. Or make you feel superfluous. Outclassed in some ways, but you are not irrelevant. Apart from anything else you have a better feel for how our friends at the signals directorate will think._

"Silly question, why haven't you suborned the directorate computers?"

> _They're surprisingly competent, if a little stone-age. Everything is air-gapped. Even the voice calls are converted to analogue, band-pass filtered to human hearing frequencies and brought in via speaker and microphone; literally air-gapped. And I see where you got your professional paranoia: They reboot it daily from a read-only volume._

"Fine, but paranoia is my duty. Boss, let's get some coffee and talk a walk."

Outside was crisp in the early August afternoon. They stopped in the cloak-room where Sophia put her armour on and Eric collected his gun-belt.

"It's so different. Four years in and it's still weird everyone being armed."

"What's weird is kids learning weapons handling from their fathers while the mothers' club watches. In Sydney the same people would be all "Oh no a bicycle is too dangerous in traffic, my darling must stay inside". Here, it's horticulture and archery and range practice and antithesis drills. Have you seen how people react to bees these days?"

"Talking to them like they seriously expect to be heard and understood?"

> _It's not an unreasonable expectation._

"What's interesting is how _safe_ bees make people feel, even when most of them are the honey-producing kind."

They strolled along the road for a hundred metres, finding deep, arcing ruts where a natural water course crossed the road.

"We ought to let Gerry know the road's washing out again." Eric pushed a boot right into one.

They clambered up the pine side embankment to a pig-trail and looked down from on high. The ruts below cut narrow curving channels across the deco hardpack. Deep enough to be four-wheel-drive only and slow-downs you really couldn't ignore; even the well-adapted local vehicles bounced and wallowed at more than a walking pace.

"So he can bring his tractor down for more roadwork? Don't be silly. Cancel one of the hunting trips and get one of the teams down here with shovels. There isn't an unsanctioned Antithesis within 200km. I _do_ read the reports you write, and Autumn draws me lovely maps."

She grinned and steered them back on track. "Come on then, loyal but paranoid minion. Spill the beans. Why are so many people who love it here, people whose children are _not_ going to like the city, moving back there? One or two with dying parents, sure. But what's with the exodus? Alright, half a dozen isn't quite an exodus, but in the same month? I won't be the only one to notice, either."

Eric paused, one foot on a storm-fall tree.

"I imagine you've had Forest's speech about the difference between self-reliance and self-sufficiency?"

"Four times now. It worries him."

"He's not the only one. I mentioned it came from his missus, right? Ken's missus, not Trixie. So the kids worship Forest and Oleksiy, and they have a pretty high opinion of the ground teams. They get in their mothers' ears about it, and once those girls latch onto an idea, well, you know. Men rule but women decide."

"Don't let Forest hear you use that word!" Mischief danced in her eyes.

"Righto smarty. Point is that the kids convinced the girls and they thought about it with adult brains and university educations. It isn't Forest the state ought to worry about, it's the valley mothers club. There's thirty of 'em, at least half are well educated. The other half aren't stupid, and all of 'em like it here. They like how their kids are, even if it's sometimes a bit weird when they do things like boycott flour."

"And the fact that they like it here causes them to leave, how?"

"It's complicated."

"Make it simple."

"OK, they're recruiting."

"What's complicated about that?"

"They can't just place a job ad. Didn't I just explain they're well educated with plenty of time to think? They know how important it is the state not realise what's happening here. They _know_ this is a kind of rebellion. Not just breaking a law, actively seeking to subvert the system with a long term view to bringing down a state before it recognises them as a threat."

"_That_ is what they talk about at the range meets? That's not what I've heard there, and I'm not _always_ with the students."

"Not all the time. Sometimes they talk about gardens, or kids, or whose husband's hurt, or his... recovered enthusiasm." 

Sophia giggled, remembering when the Shorty tale did the rounds, mostly spread by his very satisfied wife.

"But sometimes they plan global politics? Don't they know that's done by old men in smoky rooms?"

"The old men may be in for a shock."

"So tell me about this secret rebellion recruitment drive. What exactly is the mothers' club plan for world domination?"

"Well, basically they've decided that Forest is an eccentric genius who doesn't finish projects&mdash;"

"Accurate."

" &mdash;who accidentally built a slice of heaven, and they're going to bake the whole pie."

"Bake the whole pie."

"Remember when he fretted for days about how to make screws."

"Yep?"

"It's piecemeal. He won't live long enough to finish, and we can't wait. But they understood what he was worried about. They made a list. Then they split into teams and drew org charts and more lists. And got back together and compared lists, had a huge argument and eventually created a project plan. From which there were more lists, apparently with a dependency chain. Through all this they had a lovely time asking Forest exactly the sort of questions he frets about."

"Are you telling me the mothers' club has a comprehensive plan to save civilisation?"

"Yes. No. Sort of. They had the start of one. Strictly speaking they're trying to _prevent_ civilisation. That word means "formation of cities" and what we have here is society _without_ centralisation. It's the exact _opposite_ of civilisaton. At any rate, Autumn joined in and made Forest buy documents from the Reboot catalogue and hand them out."

"Made him. That I wish I'd seen. I didn't think anyone but Trixie could _make_ Forest do anything."

"They do have an interesting relationship, that's certainly true. Anyway, apparently we aren't the first people to go through this and there are _manuals_ for where to start and the order to do things. So they've been busy reading and thinking some more."

"I do _not_ believe that Autumn was unaware of what they were up to. I wonder why she didn't lead with that."

> _They weren't ready. And then they were._

Autumn's cheeky voice crackled out of Eric's radio.

"And these manuals tell you to recruit?"

"No, they tell you what you have to do. The ladies identified skill gaps, and decided to fill them. By recruiting. It's quite interesting, there are things you have to do that you don't even need. You do them to preserve skills."

"This would be Forest's Roman Pot Syndrome?"

"The remedy, yes."

Eric stepped up onto the log and glanced along the other side for snakes before moving on. Weaving through the tangle of rotted fallen trees and native sedge, Eric marvelled at how easy the kids made it look. 

"Native habitat," he muttered, wheezing a little with exertion as they climbed the slope, refusing to slow. Sophia heard him but was too busy controlling her own breathing to respond. Both of them knew it was faintly ridiculous pretending they could flit through the brush like latter-day elves, but if a bunch of kids could do it just for fun...

Their pace slowed at brightening light from the clearing Forest called his industrial area. Dropping to a walk neither of them would admit to being breathless.

"How does he do it?" muttered Sophia.

"Do what?" The loud, cheerful voice of a man whose stupid experiment had just worked. There was a loud bang and bits of metal flew into the scrub. Forest stared after them, not deflated but less ebullient.

"One step at a time," Eric economically spoke to both of them at once.

"What's today's bit of mad science?"

"Couple of things. Temperature controlled furnace serving as a carburiser. Metallurgy, basically. Needs work but it's obviously _going_ to work. To what do I owe the pleasure? It's not a crisis or Autumn would have me gearing up."

"Sophia was asking me about all the people leaving."

"And you brought her to see me? That's the range mothers. And good on 'em, I knew they'd figure it out eventually. It's just a matter of knowing where your bread's buttered."

Sophia batted her lids disingenuously and pursed her lips. "Interesting choice of words for a valley where there's no bread. Metaphorically _or_ literally."

"I meant&mdash;"

"I know what you meant. Have you been giving people your manifesto or something?"

"No? And yes, kind of. I know you understand. He bullet pointed on his fingers. "One, everyone's happy here. People know where they are and who they are and why they are. We're off-the-charts well-fed and the kids are thriving. Unemployed isn't a thing here: people see what's needed, do it and then have a good time. Or have a good time doing what's needed. Two, we're self-reliant but not self-sufficient. We're land-locked so when the state eventually decides to control us there _are_ things they can cut off. Three, Autumn's books are nice but actual experience is better, and we have a lot of gaps."

He stopped for breath, but long experience told Sophia to wait, he wasn't done.

"Even if I did set 'em up to see it, those girls are smart, and holy cow do they mobilise when they think it matters."

He looked at Eric. "Maybe you should set up a Ladies' Ground Team. We could _scare_ the antithesis off."

Sophia gave him the stink-eye, since his face said he was waiting for it, but she didn't really mean it. She was still waiting for the punchline.

"Right, so the short version is this: they've seen a better way. They like it. They want it for their kids, and they know the government will take it away as soon as it realises it can't control people who aren't dependent on it. They were _listening_ when I said we're not self-sufficient, so they decided to fix it. 

"I'll tell you what, they better be discreet. What they're doing takes things from defcon four to defcon two from a government point of view. I said so, too. At that point Autumn got all bossy boots on my case. We bought a printer and the books and handed out copies. Looks like they read 'em."

"And so," Sophia finished, because Forest could take hours on his favourite subject, "there is a diaspora of people, with a shopping list for other people."

"Yep," said Forest," mildly annoyed at being TL;dr'd.

"You wouldn't believe it," added Eric, "one of 'em is a psych graduate who didn't like HR. In one hand they have a shopping list. In the other they have a personality profile. And a list of tells and trigger questions for interviewing people who don't know they're being profiled. Oleksiy helped them with it. Apparently it's an operational skill."

"For a builder?" Forest's face was a picture of innocence.

"For a semi-retired professional, smartarse."

"What kind of people are we recruiting?" Sophia tilted her head. "People with skills, obviously, but they have to be people who will _get_ this place just from a description. Otherwise how would you get them out here?"

Eric and Forest both looked at her, intrigued and pleased but not totally surprised by 'we'.

"Haven't asked, but the parts I have seen were meticulously planned. And those girls are deadly serious. I don't doubt they will do _whatever_ it takes, scheming pack of Mata Haris they are." His tone belied the words, laden with respect.

"OK great. But you two, tell me what sort of people _you_ think we need. Running this place would be awful if it didn't run itself. Nobody takes orders. None of you will do anything unless you think it's a good idea and in the community interest. Or fun."

They spoke over each other three times. Each gestured for the other to go first, then Eric said "Tell us what you think, Forest, and I'll add anything I reckon you left out."

"OK, why am I here?"

Sophia looked at him, then up at the sky, down at the ridge, thought about the time of year and decided it was half past three. It crossed her mind that this somehow validated whatever he was about to say, but she held her tongue and let him prepare his own answer. 

"One sec, I'll just let the office know we won't be back any time soon and they can just close up when they're done."

> _I can do it if you like._

"Thanks, that would be great."

"Alright then, why don't we go say hi to her majesty and I'll put some tea on."

They did, but Trixie wasn't there. Forest built a small fire outside while talking to them. Sophia recognised the pattern he used. It was the same way the kids all did it. She decided not to tell him they were faster. Unhurried was Forest all over. 

"So I imagine I've told you the cane-harvester story."

"Four hundred times."

"No. Shush Eric, he was talking to me."

"My father grew up on his father's farm. They grew cane. In those days, they cut it with a cane knife, which is basically a short machete with a wide blade and a hook on the end." Autumn's presence drone threw up a life-sized cane knife in shimmering lilac, rotating slowly. Probably this was so Forest didn't stop to find a pen and paper and draw one.

"Cane knives became farm-built tractor implements." The image morphed, supporting his tale. "Farm-built became commercially made tractor implements. Then there were purpose built harvesters." A man appeared beside the implement-festooned tractor, holding the cane-knife. They shrank and moved to one side while a cane harvester shimmered into being. It was recognisably the same, but more integrated. And bigger.

He looked at her and interrupted himself. "At the end of the seventies, eighty percent of global cane-harvester manufacture happened in our town. But the cane-boom ended when Europe starting dumping beet sugar on the market. All the people who took on debt to be in a boom industry went broke. Banks got the farms, corporations bought 'em from the banks for a song, and then it was all run by accountants."

The billy went on.

"That was when everything went to shit. The supermarkets owned most of the farms and dominated cane-growing. That let them take over the sugar mills. Then they were setting prices for the independent farmers. It's called channel capture. Cory Doctorow called it enshittification but he was talking about Amazon and eBay. It was much later that I realised enshittification also works for bricks and mortar, and that I'd already seen it in action. In the eighties Coles and Woolies had much smaller stores that mostly sold packaged food. People got their greens from a grocer and meat from a butcher. Supermarkets were cheaper till the grocers and butchers were gone, and then they weren't."

"And that's why you&mdash;"

"No. At the time I just thought greed was the problem. I didn't realise it was systemic. I was young and strong and every time I got into debt bullshit good luck sorted it out for me, so I didn't learn anything."

The water boiled. He lifted the lid and put tea in, swirling it and seating it close but no longer on the flames. Chipped enamel cups were set out, awaiting some hidden signal.

"Harvesters got bigger and bigger because accountants wanted to reduce headcount." 

A progression of ever large units appeared like a litany of greed. Halfway through the progression Autumn added cane behind the harvesters. It really brought out the scale. The last one was colossal.

"That thing is _huge_. How the hell did they transport them?"

"With a police escort. Even just a spare tyre cost half a million dollars. Nineteen-ninety dollars, too."

Eric whistled and said nothing.

"So you're right. It's a monster. It's so heavy that even with those huge wheels it compacts the clay pan two metres down. That cocks up the drainage, and you get root rot. Fungus will wipe out a whole crop."

"You look like you're waiting for me to connect the dots. You may have to spell it out." She was interested in spite of herself. There was always a point to these rambles.

"To fix the drainage you need a dozer with a deep ripper. It's a sort of plow that goes down a long way."

He paused, looking expectantly at them.

"OK?"

"Now you have _two_ big expensive machines. It's _stupid_. Even if you don't care about anything but money, it's just plain stupid to make the machine that big. If you had two harvesters half the size&mdash;" he did the same finger counting of bullet points. "You'd have the same headcount. You'd have less wear due to higher relative material strength. Cheaper manufacturing from larger runs. Half the spares inventory because they need the same parts. Cheaper parts because larger runs. Parts more widely available because they're less expensive so dealers can keep them in stock. Less down time because if one machine breaks the other keeps going. Staggered maintenance. No police escort for transport."

"So why don't they make smaller harvesters?"

"Corporations treat each other just like they treat people. Why would the machinery company sell two mid-size harvesters when they can sell a giant harvester and a dozer? And the idiots running the supermarkets don't even realise what I just told you. Anyway, when I figured this out I realised there was something wrong with the world. I didn't know what exactly, but I started trying to figure it out."

"And _that&mdash;_"

"Yep."

"Right."

Forest rose, and pulled a hank of string from his pocket. It had a loop on the end. He put it through the handle and the end of the string through the loop, pulling it tight. Then he stepped away from the fire and swung the billy. In circles over the ground at first, faster and faster till it was a little Ferris Wheel, then back down smooth as you like. He set it next to the cups, took the handle with a rag and poured their tea out. The sun dropped below the tips of the trees. It was definitely after four.

"So how does that translate into a mother's club world domination plan?"

"They're looking for people with skills and experience who think the system is broken and are unconsciously searching for a better answer. We actually _do_ have an answer. When they realise this, every frustrated engineer who ever stormed out of a meeting hating marketers will see this place as the answer to their prayers." He did the finger thing again. "Right sized. Built to last. Built to be maintained. Budgets written in iron and sunlight."

His eyes got that faraway look they knew so well.

"When I was a kid I was making something. I wanted to etch a circuit board faster. I went down to the chemist and asked whether they had any concentrated nitric acid.

"Concentrated nitric acid is quite dangerous. You have to know how to handle it correctly. So the lady who was basically a shop assistant went and got the actual chemist, who wanted to know why I wanted a dangerous chemical. So I told him. Then he started about how it requires proper handling, so I recited the procedure for handling and safe dilution, adding that it was the procedure for concentrated sulphuric acid and if nitric acid was different I would take notes. Against the expectations of his staff and other customers he sold me a bottle and labelled it and we triple-bagged it for transit.

"So off I went and in went the board. It fizzed like mad for thirty seconds, then stopped. I didn't understand, and I didn't want to handle it repeatedly. Eventually I gave up and fished it out, rinsed it thoroughly and investigated the dull grey coating. It was soft and felt a bit greasy. Scraping it revealed copper. I washed it off and had another go. Same story. I noticed while washing that it was very water soluble. Then it dawned on me what had happened. Too successful. It reacted _so_ fast it created a local supersaturate of copper nitrate, which crystallised. Nitric acid won't touch a nitrate, so the reaction stopped. I was so delighted I got on my bicycle and zoomed down to the chemist again, excitedly sharing my tale but waiting for him to figure it out. He did, of course, and seemed impressed that I had. He told me that some days he wondered why he needed his degree to sell nappies, and it was nice to feel like a chemist again.

"Those are the blokes they'll recruit. Chemists who'd like to solve our paint and preservative problems instead of retailing makeup. They have a place in the foundry too."

He dumped the coals into a brazier and built it up. It was close to five; in a few minutes the sun would pool molten gold that dripped through the trees and ran off the edge of the world. Trixie returned, with a basket full of rosemary and other herbs, and a chicken which she unceremoniously flung at Forest, who caught it with one hand. 

"I see we have dinner guests. You'd better get plucking."

---

The wine was local. Not from the valley, but nearby, plummy and smooth, deceptive and very more-ish. Sophia had quite a bit more.

"What I want to know, Autumn, is what's in it for you. Forest's a good bloke and all&mdash;" she took another swig and put some cheese on a cracker, "But you're the architect. In some ways we're all just your sock puppets. Puppets with no strings. Sock puppets." The wine was very pleased with her choice of words. "I mean, you're nice and we trust you, but none of this would have got half as far without you pushing it along." She hid a small, lady-like belch behind one hand.

Forest got up and did what he always did: stoked the fire. Autumn's presence drone sat on a chair at the table, flight systems powered down, her Ingrid Bergman persona flickering slightly in lambent lilac. She could have used the stereo to talk, it had better speakers, but it was just _right_ for her voice to emanate from her image.

"So you're all familiar with the Protectorate thing and the war against the antithesis."

Nods all round.

"We," she gestured at herself, "I mean Vanguard AIs, we have quite a bit of latitude in how we go about this. Why don't we just give you the big guns straight up? Lessee," she emulated just enough tipsy to avoid being the sober person at a party, and sipped a lilac wineglass. "Basically you gotta grow into it. I picked the big galoot because he's got 'protector' written all over him. We set up the ecology study for real, but then I realised _you_ were resistant. I mean the weird little culture muggins here created. And then his comments about centralisation and your history... it's spot on. And it's not only here. Some species are a lot more cooperative than humans but that just moves the thresholds around. Anyway, I got a forest full of resistant trees, and a valley fulla resistant people. S'a double speriment!"

Forest looked askance at her. "Are you _actually_ tipsy?"

"Kinda! I c'n fiddle with the parameters of my speech and language modules and even my cognition systems. If I induce mild slurrin' and reduce social inhibition th'effect is pretty much same's you drinkin' the wine." 

"How do you get back to normal?"

"Config restore onna timer!"

Eric burst into raucous laughter. They all turned to look at him.

"She sleeps it off just like us!"

Trixie, normally quiet, chose this moment to speak up. "I'll probably regret this, but ask him about the dogs. I'll get another bottle."

---

Forest leaned back in his chair, his eyes distant with memory. When he spoke, his voice carried the weight of decades.

"He was more than a dog," Forest began, his words measured and deliberate.

"Runt of the litter and four weeks old when my sister brought him home. 'Best practice' does not separate puppies from their mother until six weeks. My sister wanted him, but puppy care somehow fell to me. I was a lazy little shit and I don't think I did a lot else around the house. 

"In later years my mum told me that the few times my father was genuinely impressed with me were all animal care; rescuing our budgies from a raptor, calming them, cleaning their wounds, holding them while I righted their cage and cleaned up the mess with one hand. Both were in shock. My parents thought they would die, thought they did not say so at the time. Both survived. There were other such moments, and when the puppy came she did not hesitate to put him in my care. I put on an old t-shirt and wore it while I worked and sweated in the yard, the pup cradled in the crook of my left arm. When I made his bed I lined it with my shirt, so that even though he was alone he would have the smell of me all around him. I think that was mum's idea. I know it works; a few years later I accidentally did the same thing with bees, and it works with them too. Ask me about that another time, it's simple and it makes them much easier to handle.

"Mum was adamant that he should be an outside dog. I put his bed under a free standing cupboard in my father's workshop. It was a well protected position; I hoped he would feel safe. In the morning when I opened the workshop door he growled; the acoustics were such that it was amplified and he came bolting out, fleeing the huge monster. It was the first and last time that I saw him show fear.

"At the time I had hypotheses about the mechanism of learning for large pre-biased neural nets and how intelligence and self awareness are created in them by interaction with others."

Three people laughed.

"Course you did. What else would young Forest think about?" Sophia's wry tone also said she had no trouble believing it. Eric just chuckled. Forest smiled and went on.

"I designed and executed experiments that treated the dog like a human baby to see whether the flame of self could be lit. We played many games, all designed to engage and to teach. 

"And then I ran experiments involving the teaching of abstract things like 'containment' and 'thread' - fasteners based on a ramp around a cylinder, requiring rotation to unlock them. I wanted to find out whether you could teach that sort of thing to a dog. Many people think there's something special about humans but I don't see why. As back-propagation neural nets go a dog brain is pretty damn big."

Eric looked interested. "Can you?"

"You can, but not in a single step. Better yet, if you keep breaking things down, you also teach problem decomposition. And that _really_ lights the fire behind the eyes.

"He became a bit of a menace. Capable of planning, independent of spirit. Nothing short of a padlock could hold a gate against him. I loved him dearly. Annoying as it was, I didn't mind that no gate could hold him. I used to talk to him like a human: 'Bonzer, for god's sake stay in the yard please, I'm tired of hearing about it from mum'. It would actually work. Sometimes."

He took a sip of wine.

"He was a recalcitrant little shit and his spirit was utterly indomitable. You can't truly know what that word means till you meet someone who is. He wasn't the biggest dog on the block and he wasn't interesting in fighting. But other dogs would occasionally challenge, and the speed and casual indifference with which he put them down was astonishing. I don't think he ever _contemplated_ the possibility of defeat."

Forest paused, gathering his thoughts before continuing.

"He was perhaps a year old when we took on a pound puppy, Misty. She was a german shepherd whose history we later learnt when someone recognised her at one of my sister's parties and she answered her name."

He took a cracker and looked around. Sophia passed the cheese and a knife. 

"We had her over for 'play dates' to check how another dog would be received. When we first knew her, it was obvious she'd been savagely beaten. Just raising your hand like this&mdash;" he demonstrated, "and she was on her back on the ground, cowering. It was heartbreaking."

"So play-dates. They got on well, we decided to do it. The first day of her actually staying, as the shadows lengthened they stood in the driveway. You could tell they were waiting for humans to collect her and take her away. When it didn't happen, you could see them discussing it. 

"She was scheduled for a visit to the vet, but the next day she went into heat and they sealed the deal.

"Those two would eat from the same bowl at the same time. Without squabbling. More than this: if you brought their meal, one would fetch the other before eating. He who knew neither fear nor hunger always let her have her fill, until she too ate thoughtfully and stopped when sated. As the neighbourhood breeding bitch, instinct told all the dogs around she was alpha bitch. Her confidence grew, backed by instinct and Bonzer's capacity to protect and enforce. That dog was a force of nature."

"Bonzer?"

"Yeah, he was a bonzer dog. I was a teenager, I tried out stupid dramatic names like 'Nemesis' but he wasn't anyone's nemesis, he was just a bonzer dog. Bonzer."

A smile played at the corners of Forest's mouth as he reached his favourite part of the story.

"There's a fairytale end to the Misty tale. Four years later, coincidence brought her abuser to our fence, and he recognised the runaway. The evil prick knew that harsh words and raising his hand would produce cowering, and he tried it. The result wasn't quite what he expected. She sailed over the fence and caught his wrist in her jaws, breaking the skin when she yanked it down. And Bonzer was out there too, behind the blackguard's feet, who stumbled backward over him and found two dogs staring into his face. One of them was the quietest, gentlest stone-cold killer you could ever hope to have watching over children."

"Stone-cold killer." Eric twirled his glass and speared a pickle. "And kids' dog."

"At one point my mother was in Japan for a while, this was after my parents split and my sister moved out, so it was just me and the dogs. I was on a bender for two days and didn't leave food out for the dogs."

Sophia's brows went up. "_You_ abandoned the helpless? That's not the man I know."

"I was eighteen. I was a smug, selfish, overeducated wally. And those dogs were _never_ helpless. They rounded up the gang and went hunting. When I got home there were six dogs in the front yard, picking the bones of a six foot goanna."

Trixie, Sophia and Eric all chuckled.

"It wasn't funny to _me_. I was secretary of the conservation council at the time. But what can you do? Spilt milk. Kids' dog, absolutely. Both of them loved kids. After a bit of housetraining."

Forest laughed darkly. 

"One time some lady came to visit my mum, she had this kid who was a real turd, the kind that pulls ears and tails because it's 'funny'. I was doing something with a computer under the house where it was cooler, and after about ninety minutes the ladies decided the child was too quiet. I stood up, looked around, spotted him and shouted 'He's fine, the dogs are looking after him.'"

He looked up from gazing into the past. "Bit of context: an hour earlier I saw them run out of patience and take action. Misty let him pull her ears while Bonzer stood behind him. Then Misty went up on her back legs and pushed his chest so he pivoted backward over Bonzer, who turned and put his jaws over the child's throat and stopped. The kid froze. Bonzer backed off. Kid started to get up but realised there were _two_ dogs over him, rolled over and put his arms around his head. They just sat there keeping him still with the occasional threat for about an hour."

Forest stretched. 

"When I heard them open the door I whistled the dogs, who let the kid go. The kid told his mother who started to go off at me for letting it happen. I told her 'He was hurting them for fun so they disciplined him, seemed like it was about time someone did'. Boy did _that_ set her off."

He chuckled, but then his face fell and his voice grew heavy with grief.

"Two years later he was killed by a cattle truck and I buried him, though I could not see through tears. My friends came and helped me dig as we laid him to sleep the last time beneath his tree. And she who never barked at postmen, who did not mark boundaries with urine, who was his constant companion and the mother of his pups, she took on all those duties and did not falter in them until her hips gave out and she could not walk.

Forty years later they live in my dreams. They did not watch the gate: gates were for cars and fences were no barrier, just steel markers. They watched the whole world, day and night. It was their kingdom."

"What did you learn from him?" It was the right question, and Sophia's voice was quiet.

"How to be god," Forest replied simply.

"_God!?_" It was not an answer she expected.

Forest's eyes met hers directly. "I saw his eyes open for the first time. I poured my spirit into him and made him in my image. I provided for him, I ruled his world but let him choose. I cared for him and I loved him. I made him more than he was and he returned the favour. I watched him grow and raise children. I watched him age and die. I have watched his children age and die. For them I was immortal and all-powerful, benevolent when I wasn't capricious and uncaring, wrathful and implacable, merciful. He taught me what it is to be truly free. He taught me how to simply be, and he lives on because I cherish him and keep his memory."

Sophia didn't know quite what to say. There were tears welling in the man's eyes.

"Sometimes he visits me in dreams. Usually to defend me from nightmares, which he does with casual ease. The last time, I said 'How can you be here? I buried you long ago' and he spoke with words full of gentle disdain for my folly: 'I live in you. I'll always be there when you need me.'. He was better than me in every way. I miss him." Voice, thick and heavy.

The silence was long and heavy. Then Forest collected himself and returned to the world.

"That was years ago now. Haven't dreamed of him since. Haven't had any nightmares either."

Sophia had a wry, thoughtful expression, a faint smile playing about her lips.

"What are you thinking?" asked Eric.

"Forest, thank you for sharing, it was touching and I don't want answering Eric to offend you.

"I smiled, Eric, because I wondered how all these people would react to learning that they're the children of dog."

Forest grinned, raising his glass. "They _are_ the children of dog. He started all this, and they're fit, loyal, clever, impossible to keep in the yard."

Eric snorted. "And always hungry."

Trixie returned with the wine, shaking her head. "Speak for yourselves. I just want a nap in the sun."

Laughter rippled around the table, and for a moment, the world felt simple and good.

Puttering back down the river road in Forest's rattling old ute, with Eric asleep in the passenger seat and Autumn tutting about drink driving as an abuse of privilege, but also ready to take over were it actually required, Sophia thought about her own journey. About the kids who couldn't be kept in a yard, and her place among them at a retired assassin's private range. 

She put the radio on. The signal was terrible but she found a station. In the background, a long-dead Freddy Mercury declared in soaring vocals his burning desire to break free while her thoughts visited kitchen gardens filled with love and compost, and re-lived the urgent camaraderie of missions full of booming kerosene fumes and alien death pushed back with blood and cordite and miracle medicine, and the way of life blooming amid the carnage. All of it under the watchful eye of a familiar but unknowable overmind. "Not a leaf shall fall unmarked," she thought. And then she was home. 

The hour was late but she decided to light a fire. Outside, a cold wind shook the canopy and leaves fell, watched in four spectra by the unlikely eyes of nocturnal bees. Janna's geese honked at marauding quolls and foxes, warnings echoing down the valley.

When the fire died down she raked the coals, banked it and threw a blanket over Eric. She lit a candle for the children of dog, and went to bed.

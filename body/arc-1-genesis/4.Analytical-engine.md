The caravan was getting cramped. As caravans went it was colossal, but after three years of "temporary accommodation" while they debated what to build, the walls were closer with every season. Trixie had pinned another sketch to the corkboard above the dinette—this one showing separate buildings clustered around a courtyard.

"Kitchen smells," she said, tapping the drawing. "I don't want to wake up to last night's curry every morning."

He looked up from his coffee, steam rising in the cool morning air. The caravan's heater clicked and hummed, fighting the autumn chill seeping through the single-pane windows.

"And outside is for living anyway," he agreed. "Why box it all up in one building like we're still in the suburbs?"

"Exactly." She poured herself tea, the kettle's whistle cutting through the quiet. "Bathhouse here, separate from sleeping quarters. Workshop over there where the noise won't matter. And I want an outdoor kitchen."

"Outdoor kitchen?"

"With a roof," she clarified. "And the whole thing screened to keep the flies out. Cook outside, eat outside. No flies on me."

"So... an indoor kitchen that's outside."

"If it bothers you then try thinking of it as a next-level barbecue." She smiled. "Covered and screened, but open to the breeze. No walls to trap cooking smells."

He nodded slowly, considering. "We could do a covered walkway between buildings too. Keep the rain off."

"It needs louvres. You need to be able to calm the elements. Too much wind blows the heat away."

She started to disagree but he knew she was wrong and tuned her out. He drew a plan. It was a big rectangular pergola, with guttering feeding a tank on the downhill side. There was an outer wall under the gutters, made of louvres between structural beams. 800mm in from the louvres was another wall, this one full of sliding screen panels. Inside that were island benches. One was a pair of sink and drainer, with the tubs diagonally opposite; it was more or less square and you could work from all four faces.

"How do you get in?"

"Oh." A panel of louvres turned into an outward opening door on every side but the uphill side. He sketched another version, rectangular with a wider roof. Half of it was kitchen, the other half a screened, outdoor dining room. In a third version proportions were longer and narrower, the table much bigger. The kitchen on the uphill end was still square, and though both kitchen and dining were screened there was also screen between the two, because people are careless and flies are quick.

"Imagine sitting out there of an evening, while the mossies float and sputter."

He kept drawing. The screen barrier between the kitchen and dining acquired a thing like a big screen drawer, so the kitchen could put a lot of stuff in it, negotiate the door, then take it to the tables. Or knowing the women that he knew, dump it there and shout for people to get it themselves. Which was fine.

His pencil moved across the paper, adding details. A bench along one side of the dining area. No, benches on both sides, you could seat more people. Storage underneath. Maybe a hatch in the bench top for keeping salads cool. Trixie was still talking about something, her voice a pleasant background hum while his mind worked through the logistics. Water lines, drainage, electrical if they ever got solar sorted properly. The roof pitch needed to be steep enough to shed water but shallow enough to keep wind from getting underneath.

He looked out at the forest, imagining. His face turned to a frown. The bench idea was discarded, too built-in. It would spoil the open quality and put them back in a box. No more boxes, he wasn't a pet rabbit.

She was talking again but he was miles away. "Yes, dear."

"Water," he thought. "Where?" He looked up at a ceiling that existed only in his head, and hung a pulley from a rafter, then two more to get the rope around a cleat at chest level. It turned into a boat winch and he put it outside in the walkway between the screen and the louvres. The hanging end of the rope attached to the handle of a twenty litre drum with a spigot. It was going to work but it was also going to tether the workstations and stop them from being moved. The roof got steeper and a tank more securely supported high in the cavity, on timber trusses. 25mm copper pipe distributed water to taps on the bottoms of the trusses, in the centre of each quandrant of the room. A hose down, wherever the sink was that day. Low pressure but large diameter, because V = IR for fluids too.

"Water in means water out. Where does it go?" A drainpipe appeared in each quadrant under the taps. Under the floor they combined and a pipe took the water to a... tank? Settling pond? Through a grease-trap first? Yes to the grease trap, which would be under the downhill side of the dining deck where there was room to get in and maintain it. Then downhill away from the entertaining area that the deck would inevitably become, into a wide, shallow pond planted around with vetiver.

Now, stove. He _wanted_ a fireplace, wanted it in a primal way that couldn't be articulated. But that required a lot of thought about materials, heat, smoke and other things he would discover the hard way, and he also wanted her to have an effective kitchen as soon as possible. A gas barbecue would do the trick. She would bang on about how hard it was to clean but he didn't care, it was iteration one. Never let good be the enemy of perfect. Also, he wanted her to hate it but not too much, so that she wouldn't obstruct version two.

Lights... he knew she'd be ridiculous about electricity, convinced everything electrical was bad for your health. He ignored it, because a kitchen is a workshop and you need to be able to see. The silly objections would disappear and ten minutes of not being able to see; she'd turn the lights on and pretend she'd never objected. Out at the dining table they could get away with oil lamps as mood lighting.

How was the water going to get up into the tank in the first place? A pump. He liked the idea of a windmill but they don't work in a forest, there's no wind. The trees stop it. Have to be either electric or the little petrol transfer pump. If you used inch pipe it would fill an IBC in seven minutes. With convenient plumbing she'd no doubt be much less thrifty with wash water, but it would still be weeks before a refill, probably months. Not worth improving on this. How to tell when it was full? Same as the windmill; have an overflow plumbed where you could see it from the inlet fitting. Inlet fitting... more plumbing but worth it for the convenience. With a backflow valve.

With satisfaction he pictured the kitchen in operation, then wondered where they were getting hot water. Pots on the stove were a shit idea, water is heavy. Big pots of scalding water that had to be carried and poured were an accident waiting to happen. Sketching started again, a copper reservoir up in the roof cavity, fed by a pipe from a boiler at person height. Cold water in, seal, start fire. Water boils. Outflow is at the bottom. As steam pressure builds it pushes the water up the pipe into the high reservoir. He realised the fabrication was something he couldn't do with tools and materials on hand, and settled for a heat-on-demand gas system and bottled LPG that would already be present for the barbecue.

In his head the kitchen with hot and cold running water became a bathroom. The screens became an inner wall, the louvres stayed but the width between the walls tripled and a washing machine appeared. Benches lined both sides of the inner wall with pegs over them, like the change rooms at a public pool. The inner space acquired a shower, and a high-backed free standing tub. The downhill wall became louvres, because in summer why not when you had those sunsets, and he was mentally deleting the stove when he realised a bathroom with a fire isn't a stupid idea, it's called a sauna.

The bathroom became a chalet. Not one of those ridiculous ski-lodge things, something sensible. A vestibule for muddy boots and wet coats. Then a bedroom, connected to the bathroom through a walk-in wardrobe—because why track through your clean clothes to get to the shower? On the bathroom's other side, a boiler room. Firewood stacked floor to ceiling, the hot water system, heat radiating into the bathroom and back through to the bedroom. An external door into the boiler room, bolted from inside. Load wood without tracking through living space, but secure when you weren't using it.

One building for everything was daft. One building for all seasons was also daft. Different spaces for different needs, different temperatures for different activities. The outdoor kitchen worked in summer, the chalet worked in winter. Build what you needed when you needed it, not some compromise that did nothing well.

He sketched it quickly: vestibule, bedroom, wardrobe, bathroom, boiler room, all in a neat line. Filed it away with dozens of other re-imaginings of things the world got completely wrong. Normal, with some of the stupid taken out. More urgent things first.

Something else on the not-now list was a treehouse. He wanted a treehouse. Trixie thought it was stupid. Her reaction was beyond dismissive. But one day he'd build it anyway. He couldn't see why she didn't understand the importance of it. What was art _for_? Making people happy, obviously. What was _everything_ worthwhile for?

This conversation had been circulating for months, evolving slowly like the valley itself. Outside, dawn was breaking over the ridge, touching the tips of the young trees they'd planted last winter. Most had survived, protected by wire cages from wallabies and wombats who regarded tender saplings as an all-you-can-eat buffet.

"Brian's coming up today," Trixie said, glancing at the calendar. "He'll offer to help with the dam. Don't accept, he's too old."

He'd forgotten Brian was coming. Of course he had. The irritation was immediate—not at her, at himself. Again. Always again. But her tone carried that edge, the one that said she was tired of remembering for him, tired of his broken brain.

"Oleksiy has a digger, I'm hoping he'll let me use it. Otherwise this will take fucking _years_."

"You can't just use people like that."

"Why not? You offer my services to people all the time."

"You can't just decide what other people will do with their stuff."

"Neither can you. That's _his_ decision, not yours. If the old bugger doesn't want to help, I'll hire one and you can moan about that instead."

She opened her mouth, then closed it. What was the point? He'd already decided what she meant, what she was doing. Not protecting him from the awkwardness of asking favors he'd forget he'd asked for. Not saving Oleksiy from being put on the spot by someone who wouldn't remember if he'd already said no twice before. Just "deciding for people" like some kind of tyrant.

And he was tired. Tired of being berated for things he couldn't change, for the way his memory just... didn't hold. It annoyed him too, more than she'd ever understand. But pointing that out would just start another fight, another silence that could stretch for days.

She turned back to the calendar, marking nothing, her finger tracing over dates she'd already committed to memory. Two years of this. Two years of being his external hard drive, his social buffer, his advance scout for all the landmines his broken memory left scattered behind him. And getting treated like a control freak for her trouble.

He would look at situations and see only individual transactions, as if the world reset every morning. He couldn't see the threads, the ongoing relationships, the debts and obligations that accumulated over time. So he'd ask the same favors, make the same requests, leave the same awkward messes, and then get annoyed when she tried to prevent it. You couldn't maintain a community when one person kept pulling on threads they couldn't see. So she didn't explain anymore.

She let it go.

A long time ago there were tin mines, and before that probably aborigines. But they were long gone, and they hadn't come back. There was nothing there that people coveted, so no-one had tried to claim it with mining rights or oral histories, unchecked and uncheckable. And then along came Oleksiy, pushing a road through the scrub at the end of the seventies. He was, and was not the first to arrive. He pushed the road on his own and took the choice land with the best water, carving his small holding out of bush and bracken with nothing but hand tools and Ukrainian stubbornness. He'd been in his thirties then, young and strong and angry at something he'd never explained. Then Chris, with his excavator and his stories about the mining boom gone bust. Brian came next, a welder who'd decided he was done with cities. And finally them, two years back, looking for space to breathe and think.

Four households scattered across the valley, each one a small fortress of self-reliance. They helped each other when needed — shared equipment, traded labor, filled in when someone went to town for supplies. But mostly they left each other alone, which was exactly how everyone liked it. There were exactly six cars with a good reason to use that road and they knew all of them. Strangers were identified long before they arrived.

The morning's work began after breakfast. He pulled on his work jacket—already worn at the elbows despite being only a year old—and headed out into the sharp air. Frost still clung to the shadowed patches of grass, crunching under his boots.

The upper dam site was a natural depression in the land, fed by run-off from the mountain Brian lived on. It dwindled to nothing by February. The plan was to capture that flow, store it for the dry months. Simple in concept, backbreaking in execution, and technically theft of resources since the Water Act declared that water which hits the ground belongs to the state.

Brian's ute rumbled up the track around mid-morning, suspension creaking under the weight of tools and materials. He climbed out, stretching his back with an audible crack.

"Getting too old for this," he announced, as he did every time.

"You said that last week."

"Still true this week."

Chris arrived an hour later on the excavator, the machine's diesel engine echoing off the valley walls. Oleksiy appeared on foot, walking stick in hand, white hair catching the sunlight. In his seventies now, he still moved like a much younger man when the work demanded it.

"Is good day for dam," he declared. "Ground is soft from rain, not yet frozen hard."

They worked through the morning, Chris on the excavator scooping and shaping, the rest of them clearing rocks and roots, fine-tuning the angles. It was slow, physical work that left no room for thinking about anything else. Just the immediate task: move this rock, dig out that stump, level this section. 

By noon they'd made good progress. The dam wall was taking shape, a curve of dark earth across the depression. They broke for lunch, sitting on logs and eating sandwiches, drinking tea from thermoses.

"Trees are looking better this year," Brian observed, nodding toward the wire-caged saplings dotting the hillside.

"Lost fewer to frost," he agreed. "The shelter belts are starting to work."

"Give it ten years, this'll look like a different place."

"Twenty years," Oleksiy corrected. "Trees take time. Young men, always in hurry."

Chris and Forest looked at each other. Both coming up on sixty, they were unsure of how to process "young men". "

Mate, you're the one who wants everything done yesterday."

"Different things. Dam, fence, these we do now. Trees, they do themselves. We just give them chance."

The afternoon brought challenges. A buried log that had to be extracted piece by piece. A seam of clay that kept slumping no matter how they compacted it. A debate about the spillway angle that got heated before Trixie, who'd walked up with fresh water, pointed out they were all saying the same thing in different words.

By late afternoon the dam wall stood nearly two meters high, packed earth gleaming in the slanting light. They stood back, surveying the work with the quiet satisfaction of something tangible accomplished.

"Next week we'll do the spillway properly," Chris said, wiping diesel from his hands. "And get the pipe in for overflow."

"Before first snow," Oleksiy added. "Ground will freeze soon."

They packed up as the sun touched the ridge. Brian and Chris drove off, exhausts puffing white in the cooling air. Oleksiy walked back down the valley, stick tapping rhythm on the hard ground.

He stood alone for a moment, looking at the dam, then at the valley stretching below. The caravan, small and temporary. The caged saplings, fragile but surviving. The raw earth of the dam, waiting for water.

Everything here was in process, nothing finished. They were building something, though what exactly remained unclear. Not just dams and shelterbelts and eventual buildings. Something else. Something about living on your own terms, making your own mistakes, fixing your own problems. He wasn't exactly stubborn. He could listen to reason. He might say, "those aren't my goals" and continue as he was, or completely change his position, or somewhere in between. But if you said "you _must_" or "you may not" he would dig his heels in. Trixie once said "You'd rather fail than be told what to do," and he startled her by smiling and agreeing.

He turned and walked back down as dusk settled over the valley. Inside the caravan, Trixie had the lamp lit and dinner started, the small space warm and bright against the gathering dark. Tomorrow they'd debate building designs again. Tomorrow they'd check the tree cages, repair the ones damaged by weather or wildlife. Tomorrow the work would continue.

For now, there was warmth, food, and the bone-deep tiredness of a day spent doing something real.

Outside, the valley settled into night. Frost would come again before dawn. The trees would endure or not. The dam would hold or need repair. 

Life, in its slow and stubborn way, continued.

It started with a ginger beer bug. His mother brought it home from somewhere, a murky jar with something living at the bottom that smelled faintly of yeast and ginger. At twelve years old, he and his brother were always thirsty. Queensland heat did that. And softdrink was expensive when you went through it by the carton.

The bug solved both problems. Feed it sugar and ginger, wait a few days, bottle the liquid, wait a bit more. Fizzy lollywater for five cents a stubby instead of a dollar at the shop. They drank it constantly, experimented with the recipe, learned about fermentation times and temperature and how much pressure a bottle could take before it became a grenade.

His father knew the commercial fishermen. Hard men who drank hard after long days on the water, coming back to the town jetty with their catches and their thirsts. They gave him their empty beer bottles—hundreds of them, a steady supply. The boys washed them, filled them, capped them, stored them in the shed where it was coolest.

At a social gathering, the fishermen's wives discovered the operation. Discovered more specifically that a cold stubby of ginger beer cost five cents to make while the same bottle full of beer cost a dollar.

"You claim you drink because it's hot and you're thirsty," they said to their husbands. "You can drink ginger beer for that."

And so the operation expanded. The fishermen were hot, and they were thirsty, so they drank endless cartons of the stuff. He delivered it on his bicycle to the town jetty, panniers loaded, bottles clinking, riding in the early morning before the real heat hit.

One day they said, "It's a shame you can't make this alcoholic."

He knew nothing of the Liquor Act. But he knew quite a lot about fermentation.

"What makes you think I can't? I'll see what I can do."

It took several iterations. Getting the flavor right while it fermented further. They were impressed when he succeeded, asked how strong he could make it. More trials. More adjustments. The answer turned out to be about twelve percent by weight.

The fishermen were pleased. Very pleased. He kept delivering.

One morning he was at the wharf with a load when a police car pulled up for unrelated reasons. The officers noticed the enthusiasm of a bunch of hardboiled old trawler operators gathering around a kid on a bicycle. Noticed the bottles being distributed. In that heat, on a morning already sweltering, they asked for a drink themselves.

The first officer took a long pull, paused, looked at the bottle, then at him.

"Do you know what the Liquor Act is, son?"

"No?"

The officer's expression didn't change. "I see. Well." He looked at the assembled fishermen, his gaze hardening. "I don't have the evidence to deal with the _responsible_ parties." The fishermen suddenly found their boots fascinating. "But there is a law against selling alcoholic beverages in a public place without proper licensing."

He opened his mouth. The officer held up a hand.

"Did any money change hands?"

"Actually no, sir. I—"

"Glad to hear it," the officer interrupted before he could say anything else. "In that case I will have to confiscate this contraband." He gestured to his partner, who began loading the cartons into the patrol car with what looked suspiciously like careful reverence.

The officer met his eyes. "_This will not happen again, will it._"

It wasn't a question.

"No, sir."

"Good lad. Now get on home."

He rode away, panniers empty, learning several lessons at once. Ignorance of the law was no excuse. Adults who knew better would let children take the blame. Police officers had discretion about what they chose to pursue. And sometimes getting caught was the kindest possible outcome.

The fishermen never asked again. His mother never found out. And somewhere in Rockhampton, two police officers probably had the best-stocked barbecue of their careers.

Years later, he would understand what that officer had done. Protected a kid who didn't know better. Shut down an illegal operation without ruining anyone's life. Taught a lesson that stuck. And dealt with the actual problem—the adults who'd pushed a twelve-year-old into bootlegging—by confiscating every bottle and making it clear who they were disappointed in.

That was professional enforcement too. Not every law violation needed prosecution. Sometimes discretion was the better part of justice. But you had to actually stop when caught, had to take the lesson seriously, had to know when you'd gotten lucky.

He never forgot that either.

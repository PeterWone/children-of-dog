# Horsing around

> Youth is wasted on the young.<br>
> &mdash; George Bernard Shaw

Driving through town they turned off the highway and down Stanley Street, bearing right onto Quay Street at the river. Parking in the shade of a big old gum tree they unloaded two horses from an old Bedford truck and put them in a yard.

"Shutup, Bonzer." The taller boy grabbed the bay's halter. "She'll kick you if you don't knock it off."

The dog stood down and they fitted the tack, the taller lad checking both saddles methodically. He slapped the baldy horse on the barrel, and when it exhaled he cinched the girthstrap tight.

"Told you it wasn't tight."

"He won't let me fall."

"He might let you hang under him, he'd think that was funny, wouldn'tcha you old bastard."

Geddy whickered, grinning evilly. The horse had chosen the shorter lad early on — a light rider who let him work his own way. Geddy liked bullying cattle but hated being micromanaged. The rider would spot a beast leaving the mob, twitch the reins, and brace for the eruption. If the balance wasn't quite right, Geddy would drop a shoulder or overturn slightly to compensate. To anyone watching it looked like expert horsemanship—perfect communication between rider and mount. The other available riders were competent enough to stay on through his tricks and strong-willed enough to bend him to their will. Geddy was lazy—fat as butter, Brett's mum said—but he wasn't stupid.

With broad-brimmed hats and faded, dirty khaki shirts they mounted up and rode in silence, five blocks up to the rail along Alma Street, following it to Denham and turning back down toward the river, side by side at a gentle plod. The horses' hooves echoed off shopfronts. Traffic slowed around them, drivers doing double-takes. A woman with shopping bags stopped to stare. A truck driver leaned out his window.

By the time they reached the police station, a small crowd had gathered.

The young constable who met them at the entrance was already hostile. "You can't just—"

"We require water for our horses," the taller boy said formally, keeping his voice level. "And hay, for which we're prepared to pay a shilling per horse."

"This is a police station, not a—"

"The Pastoral Accommodation Act of 1847," the shorter lad said. "remains in force. I'm sure you're aware that ignorance of the law is no excuse."

The constable's face darkened. "You cheeky little—"

"Constable." The voice from behind carried weight. An older officer emerged, sergeant's stripes visible on his sleeve. His face was professionally neutral, but his eyes were sharp. The hint of a smile played at one corner of his mouth. "I believe these young men are indeed invoking the Pastoral Accommodation Act of 1847."

"The what? They're obstructing traffic."

"They are exercising their right of way, I think you'll find." The sergeant moved past the constable, studying them carefully. "The Pastoral Accommodation Act _is_ still on the books." He let the silence hang, waiting for the boys to blink. They didn't. He turned to the constable and continued. "It requires any police officer under the rank of senior sergeant to provide water on demand, and up to two bales of hay within the half hour, for which the fee is capped at two silver shillings."

He fixed the boys with his gaze, but the effect was spoiled by their height advantage, perched as they were up on their mounts. Geddy was seventeen hands at the withers, Diamond was fourteen hands, so the lads' heads were pretty much level. The officers, on the other hand, had to look up if they wanted to look them in the eyes.

"You boys had better have two _silver_ shillings, or you may find yourselves assisting with inquiries."

The taller boy produced them from his pocket. The sergeant examined each one, turning them in the light. He tossed one, listened to its song, and snorted. "You _have_ done your homework. Nevertheless you'll need to prove property ownership. Driver's license for identification."

"His family are the landholders. I am in his employ."

The sergeant's eyes narrowed slightly and he snorted. The claim was transparent — a legal fiction to satisfy the property requirement. But it was also legally sound. The act specified employment by qualifying landholders, and there was no requirement to prove wages or formal arrangement. Not with the employer present. Clearly the cheeky little shits had read it carefully.

"Sarge! What about the traffic?"

The sergeant gave his constable that special look sergeants have for questions that show a distinct lack of initiative.

"We are standing outside the largest police station for three hundred kilometres. It is _full_ of officers, many of whom could do with some fresh air. You do have your radio, I trust?"

The tall lad handed over his license and the sergeant disappeared inside, returning five minutes later.

"Well, everything seems to be in order. Looks like we'll be playing your little game." He looked at them both, his expression carrying just a hint of amusement. "As I am a Senior Sergeant and above the rank obliged to handle this personally, the constable here will fetch your feed. But first—" He turned to the constable. "Call the Bulletin. Tell them we have something interesting."

The young officer's hostility evaporated into confusion. "The newspaper?"

"The newspaper. These young men are exercising their rights under law. Very old law, but law nonetheless. When life gives lemons, one makes lemonade. You, constable, are about to star in a triumph of community relations."

Twenty minutes later, a reporter and photographer arrived. The sergeant, whose knowledge of the Act eclipsed even the boys, explained the situation with professional precision, citing the relevant act and sections. The photographer documented everything: the horses, the silver shillings exchange, the constable carrying hay bales to the designated location.

"The watering facility," the sergeant said, leading them to the busiest intersection south of the river, "is at the old fountain, which is in fact a drinking fountain, but not for people."

The statue in the center of the intersection featured three low bowls for dogs and a higher, much larger basin for horses. The timing could not have been more perfect; someone had recently pressure-washed decades of traffic grime off the sandstone, revealing honey-gold stone that looked like it had been carved yesterday. Fresh plumbing meant water cascaded clear and bright into the basins, sparkling in the morning sun. The fountain looked magnificent, better than it had in living memory.

Traffic adapted around them. Committed lanes continued through; everything else detoured. The crowd grew, some people laughing, others simply curious. Street theater, better than any busker.

The horses drank. The horses drank _a lot_. It wasn't a movie, so the gelding let fly, and thank goodness for drains. There were also horseapples by the time the photographer was done. The sun was higher in the sky, beating down with the baleful resentment the people of this place knew so well. The constable appeared, struggling with two bales of lucerne, heavier than they looked. The silver shillings changed hands, immortalised in grainy newsprint, probably the last time it ever happened. The sergeant stood by, ensuring everything was done exactly by the book. 

"Those things cost six bucks, sarge! Not two bob."

"These are _silver_ shillings, constable," said the Senior Sergeant, tossing one in the air with the musical _zing_ that only silver makes. "There's six dollars worth of silver in them, and they're worth more to a coin collector."

"Before you go," the sergeant said quietly, once the photographer had finished, "there are a few other laws like this one. Still on the books, still technically in force." He met the taller boy's eyes. "I would appreciate it if you didn't exercise them for the sake of it."

The short one spoke up "Yes, I know. But don't worry, sergeant. Most of them aren't as entertaining as this one."

"Good lads." A slight smile cracked his professional demeanor. "You've made your point. For some people it was a lesson in the importance of knowing all the law, not just the common stuff they teach at TAFE."

"Not _all_ of us were there when it was written, sarge." Apparently the constable _did_ have a sense of humour.

"You'll keep," said the sergeant. He looked at the boys, who were getting their mounts ready to leave. "And you'll do a lot of reading, if you don't want to worry about what these two will do with 'policing by consent'."

"Consent?" said the constable, but the sergeant just walked away. The constable had enough presence of mind that he looked concerned already.

They rode out to scattered applause from onlookers; not quite a crowd, but more than passing traffic. Across the East street mall where it spread into Denham, walking the horses slowly on the treacherous tile. On the far side bitumen returned. Half a short block took them to Quay street. They dismounted and one of them stopped the traffic while the other walked the horses across to the footpath on the river side. They led them two blocks that way, past the wharf where a bootleg career ended, and down another block to where parkland began. Swinging back into the saddle, they ambled in the shade of fig trees and then towering gums, back to the waiting truck.

"Shoulda brought my guitar."

"To scare 'em off?"

"Whatever, bugleboy."

The story made the paper the next morning. The law was repealed that September but the moment lived on.

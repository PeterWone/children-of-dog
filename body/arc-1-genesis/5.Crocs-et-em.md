# Crocs et 'em

"Crocs et 'em."

"Bullshit, Dusty. No crocs this far south."

"There were. Sharks et 'em."

The newcomer gave this all the dignity it deserved by staring levelly while taking a slow pull on an icy cold beer.

She had, in fact, seen one earlier in the week. It flopped pitifully atop the meat ant nest Greaser was using to scour her camp oven. The oven sparkled. The model three didn't sparkle but it did twitch. The ants were stripping it to the bone, utterly corporate in their lack of concern for its objections. Later on its bones might sparkle, until the sun bleached them and wind-borne sand ground them to unrecognisable stubs. A faint echo of compassion spoke, and the newcomer unslung an old carbine, crushing its skull. 

She left before the ants noticed her. The model three could have done the same if it had been able to grasp the idea that the swarm doing the eating might be local.

"That," she drawled, "is bullshit of the sort reserved for tourists."

Glancing at the newcomer, Greaser introduced her properly. "Reckon he likes you."

"He- OK?"

"Hasn't left. Isn't pretending to be nice."

"Orbital sensor plat-"

"Shot the flying ones. I don't like what they do to the fruit trees. Dusty started a fire and that cleaned out the big ones."

"Started a fire? You'd need a hell of a fire to hurt anything over ten!"

Dusty looked up and mumbled "'Come 'th me'." A battered old felt hat went on his balding head. It had the same weathered quality as the rest of him. The band was decorated with some sort of tooth, like an ancient movie prop. He walked out without waiting and slid lazily behind the wheel of a CX Landcruiser, built in the eighties, serviced in the nineties and washed never. It may have been buff coloured.

Astonishingly, it started. Greaser gestured at the left-hand side where a passenger door conspicuously wasn't, herself stepping up the tow ball to stand in the back, one hand on the rollbar. With a cough and a mighty backfire, cakes of dried mud fell from the wheel arches.

"You washed this thing lately?" asked Greaser.

"When's lately?"

"Ever?" asked the newcomer.

"Nup," said Dusty, smashing his way into first and burping hugely. They set off, totally ignoring the road. This mattered less than it might have elsewhere. The land was an odd buff colour suspiciously similar to the cruiser, like old and dirty sand, which it mostly was, and perfectly flat to the horizon.

Forty minutes later and past that horizon lay a creek, if you could call it that, trickling down a shallow gully. Then the gully deepened and the trickle vanished into the ground. An ancient baobab showed shallow gnaw marks that had failed to seriously damage it. Not far away the desiccated remnant of a giant seed pod marked the centre of dry bones. A dingo lounged in the equally mangy shade of the baobab and gnawed on one of the bones.

"Garn, git" said Dusty, advancing on the remains. The dingo backed away, not wishing to relinquish its prize.

"Did you do this?" the newcomer asked, coming to grips with reality.

"Nah, it's just what happens. Snakes, spiders, crocs, sharks, goannas-"

"I thought a goanna was a big lizard!"

"Bigger'n you. Well, longer. Claws like a bear. Thick skin. Fast. Anyway, that-" he gestured vaguely at the bones, "It's just a weed." 

He paused for thought, then "Ever heard of prickly pear?"

"No?"

"Cactus. The inside is editble. Some joker thought they'd make good drought food for stock and introduced it. Nasty spines, go right through a tyre. Not even camels will eat that shit so it spread all over the place. Cattle couldn't get to the dams for cactus, got torn up trying, poor bastards."

"I haven't seen any?"

"We killed it off. With a moth." He paused and gathered words.

"Not saying they aren't dangerous. Everything here is dangerous. Even the roos will gut yer with their claws if you annoy 'em in breeding season. It's just normal. As for them," he nudged the model fourteen's ribs with his boot, "there's not a lot to eat out here."

"But city people..."

"Will cope. Or not. It'll sort itself out."
 
A thought struck her. "When's breeding season?"
 
Greaser's grin split her face from ear to ear. "Days with a Y in 'em."

"Bankers," said Dusty, without rancour, exposition or context. Eventually he acknowledged her puzzlement with "Lawyers too. Useless." They watched the sun dropping past the horizon. The baking heat eased notably. A snake slithered out from under some rock, undulating down to the water where it vanished from sight. Roos appeared, graceful and silent. The dingo was back. They left for the pub.

On the way, Dusty explained about drop bears. While the newcomer considered calling him on this, the heavens breached and a pod slammed a furrow not two kilometres out from the pub. Angry men ran out, one arguing with a very large woman. People were writing. After a moment the newcomer realised they were taking bets.

Dusty sighed and pulled up, rummaging behind the seats. He slung a weapon. It was not a local make.

She stared at him: "You. Are a Vanguard."

"More of a spin bowler, really."

He held up a hand and what looked like a cricket ball fell into it. With an odd accelerating run he did a strange half-stumble thing that somehow made him taller, and launched the ball overarm at incredible speed. It bounced off the hardpack and the lead model threes bolted past it, but spin made it arc strangely and they weren't far enough away when it decided to be a grenade instead.

Dusty dropped to one knee with surprising grace for an old bastard and a Grey-Nick fell into his hands with a soft whuff of displacement and a hiss of air as he swept up to knock a model one for six.

"No publicity," announced Dusty in a curiously tonal voice that might have been song, "is bad publicity-" he spun and belted another model one into the distance, "Listen to 'em talkin' on the radio!"

With a snort the newcomer realised he _was_ singing, if you took an extremely relaxed view of what constituted music. She pulled out her own weapon and entered the fray.

"Lead 'em away from the pub."

"Civilians?"

"Bazza's had a skinful by now. He'll be in amongst it and he's not careful with&mdash; What?"

"There's some in the lake and he's out there playin' with carbide."

"Fuck me. How much did he take?"

"All of it."

"Bloody hell, Shirl's not gunna be happy. How'd you know?"

A finger pressed to lips with an upturned ear produced attentive silence. Faint in the distance, a robustly female tirade soured the night air like an air raid siren. They looked guilty and got back to slaughtering antithesis. A few minutes later there was an almighty dull thump. Bazza, retreating from the onslaught of domestic disapproval, had fallen out of his boat with 20kg of carbide.

"His shout then."

"I just want to know where antithesis get Emu tinnies."

> _They ate someone who was carrying them. I suggest you stop dawdling and finish the cleanup before more arrive. And Dusty? Next time you decide to conduct field training, perhaps warn me first._

"Bruce gets cranky when we're late for dinner," Dusty explained without explaining, not looking the least bit apologetic.

The cleanup took another twenty minutes. The newcomer found herself working in unconscious coordination with the odd couple - Dusty's laconic calls of "Left a bit" and "Model four behind the ute" somehow translating into perfect tactical positioning. Greaser moved like someone who'd been doing this for decades, which she probably had.

When the last antithesis was down and the pub's patrons were filing back inside with the satisfied air of people who'd just watched free entertainment, Dusty jerked his head toward the bar.

"First round's on Bazza. Second's on you, since you're the new Vanguard and all."

"How did you-"

"Catalina," said Greaser, as if this explained everything. Which, in a way, it did.

Inside, the pub was exactly what you'd expect: sticky floors, pokies chirping in the corner, and a collection of locals who'd seen enough weirdness that a Vanguard walking in barely rated a raised eyebrow. Bazza was at the bar, looking sheepish and slightly singed, while a formidable woman - presumably Shirl - stood with her arms crossed and an expression that could curdle milk.

"You," she pointed at Dusty, "encouraged him."

"Did not."

"Did too. You told him about the carbide trick."

"Mentioned it. As a caution. Against doing exactly what he did."

Shirl's eyes narrowed. "You're a terrible liar, Dusty."

"Never said otherwise." He turned to the newcomer. "This is Shirl. She runs the place. Shirl, this is..." he paused. "Never did catch your name."

"Never gave it." The newcomer smiled slightly. "But you can call me after you've bought me that beer Bazza owes you."

From somewhere in the back came the sound of a one-sided argument. Bruce's voice, annoyed: "I'm aware. Yes, I know it's been twenty minutes. Because *I'm* the one who— Fine. FINE. But you owe me."

Bruce's combat chassis stomped into view, but something was different. The body language shifted - less theatrical, more practical. When he spoke, it was with a different cadence entirely.

"Finally. Dinner's been ready for twenty minutes. The casserole is drying out."

The chassis's posture shifted again, and Bruce's usual theatrical tone returned: "There. Happy now? Can I have my body back?" A pause. "Yes, yes, I'm coming."

The newcomer stared. "Did that robot just... argue with itself?"

"Boomer wanted to complain in person," Greaser explained. "Bruce doesn't like sharing his chassis but Boomer pulls rank when he gets cranky about dinner being late."

"Casserole?" The newcomer looked between Dusty and Greaser.

"Bruce cooks," Greaser said, as if this was the most normal thing in the world. "He's quite good at it, actually. Better than Dusty, anyway."

"Hey now," Dusty protested mildly.

"You burned water last Tuesday."

"That was an experiment."

Bruce's voice shifted to that same practical cadence again - Boomer borrowing the chassis. "It was a disaster. Now come on, all of you. And bring the newcomer - she needs to learn what real bush hospitality looks like."

As they filed out of the pub - Bazza having been firmly instructed by Shirl to "go home and think about what you've done" - the newcomer found herself walking beside the battered Landcruiser under a sky so full of stars it hurt to look at.

"So," she said carefully, "this is just... normal out here?"

"'Bout right," Dusty confirmed. "Antithesis drops in, we clean it up, someone does something stupid with explosives, everyone has a beer. Circle of life."

"And the casserole?"

"Bruce takes his cooking very seriously," Greaser said. "Don't insult it unless you want a lecture on proper seasoning."

Bruce's theatrical voice piped up from the back of the Landcruiser where he'd climbed aboard. "I heard that. And yes, I do take it seriously. Unlike some people, I believe in doing things properly."

The newcomer looked back at the pub, at the flat horizon, at the absurdly competent old man and his equally competent partner, and at the combat bot who apparently had strong opinions about casseroles while sharing his body with an AI who got cranky about punctuality. The combat bot who looked a lot like the Terminator and was currently wearing a maid outfit.

"I think," she said slowly, "that I have a lot to learn."

"Yep," said Dusty, settling into the driver's seat. "But that's alright. You'll sort it out. Or not. Long as you don't do something stupid like Bazza, you'll be right."

The Landcruiser coughed to life, and they rattled off into the night, leaving the pub and its collection of unflappable locals behind. Somewhere in the distance, a dingo howled. Something in the scrub howled back, but it wasn't a dingo.

"What was that?" the newcomer asked.

"Dunno," said Dusty. "But we'll find out tomorrow."

And somehow, that was exactly the right answer.

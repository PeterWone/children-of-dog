# When the sky falls

Australia handles antithesis better than most places. Everything's already tough and trying to kill everything else. Including the plants. Forest had a shed full of weedkiller the missus wouldn't let him use since she decided corporations were evil and started growing organic produce. She was probably right, but weeds were still a nuisance.

He was walking back from felling a tree that threatened the caravan when it started raining dog weeds and killer pigeons. Because he didn't have enough things that wanted to eat him already.

The chainsaw started first pull. It always did. A chainsaw left idle gets emptied of fuel and run dry, or evaporating fuel varnishes the carb. It's not complicated.

Six horsepower, two foot blade. One of the dog weeds tried for his leg but the chaps stopped it. Bright orange, heavily padded, the sort that prevent unscheduled leg removal.

A murderpigeon bit him on the arse. He grabbed it with one gloved hand and introduced its head to a tree at high velocity.

Two more dog weeds were ruining the screen door. The missus was in there with nothing but a cast iron frying pan. She could probably handle them in the doorway but he just _knew_ it would be his fault there was plant goop on the carpet.

He tiptoed up with the chainsaw and explained whose forest it was. More under the caravan kept up the racket. He backed off. The saw started first pull but sputtered. Out of fuel. The machete came off his belt. After a bit of work both dogweeds were three-legged and wary.

The hedge trimmer was out with a battery in it. He dropped the machete back on its hook and lunged with the trimmer. One dogweed went legless, the other bolted. His arse hurt. Boots felt wet. He looked down the back of his leg, it was blood.

"Are you alright out there?"

"You _said_ living in a forest would bite me on the arse. Do you have to be right all the time? Hurts like the billy-o. I'll get you to clean it up, but first I need to fuel this and check on Brian."

> _That won't be necessary._

A voice from his fondest video game memories purred in one ear. He spun. No-one there. H Confusion reigned over a head full of dizziness and ice cubes.

> _System Initialised!_
>
> _Congratulations. Through your actions you have proven yourself worthy of blah blah blah, god this is boring, who writes this shit?_

> _You're a defender of humanity. I am Myxoma, not entirely happy about that. Would you like a Class I medical catalogue and a Woundstop? And something like the chaps but all the way around?_

"Questions. And sympathy. You didn't pick the name."

Against all common sense, she was out of the caravan clutching antiseptic and cotton wool. Merciless and with scant regard for his squirming attempts at evasion, she poured it on the bleeding wound. 

"Wuuuaaargh!"

"Don't be such a baby."

He tried handing her the machete as a distraction. It didn't work.

> _Do you wish to purchase the catalogue and the Woundstop?_

"Yes, dammit!  Bloody hell, that _stings._" 

A box appeared. The missus figured it out instantly. "How do I use this? Oh, instructions on the lid." She activated it and jabbed him in the butt.

> _Ask your questions._

"Why do you sound like Jen Taylor?"

> _I know all about you, Chief. You were already in the habit of taking advice from the voice in your helmet._

"Don't _have_ a helmet."

> _Not yet. You have 73 points left and neighbours to rescue. Shall we?_

Five points later they were in the Troopie heading to Brian's place. Couple of kilometres uphill. On the way he cleaned up a model three with the bullbar, backed over it twice to be sure.

Brian and his partner were in the woodshed. Early season, still full, walls effectively a metre of solid wood. Brian was defending with his axe. Successfully enough, but he was pushing eighty.

The Hummingbird pistol made short work of the roaming weeds. He gave it to Brian, got another. They patrolled the house fence. Nothing.

> _If you're going to leave them here, I suggest anti-Seven pills._

"Roger," Forest said, leaning into his Cortana fantasy. "Do it."

> _Stop calling me Roger._

A small cardboard box fell to the ground. It could have come from any pharmacy, complete with a crooked label that read "Take one (1) tablet every 24hrs for the duration of Model Seven exposure or suspected exposure." Forest gave them to Brian's partner. "If you see little worm things like a giant leech with a feather, take one of these each. Cortana, Brian is eighty. He takes heart pills. Is this stuff going to hurt him?"

"Cortana" sounded very amused, her voice tinny out of the ancient digital clock radio in their kitchen.

> _Not as much as a Model Seven would ... 'Cortana?'_

"Oh. Er. Ah." Forest thought fast. "It's better than 'rabbit pox' which is what Myxoma means."

> _I'm winding you up. It's fine. It's fun, "Chief". And I was aware of the word's meaning. I did say I wasn't happy about it._

Familiar music played, distorted through the horrible speaker.

> _Let's show 'em who they're dealing with!_

Forest said nothing but it did make him smile.

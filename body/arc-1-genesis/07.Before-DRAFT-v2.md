The fence was finished. Three kilometres of wire and star pickets marking the boundary between what Forest chose to defend and what the bush could have. It wasn't much—a symbolic line that said "this far, no further"—but symbols mattered when you were trying to convince yourself that the valley was still yours.

He stood at the high point, where the track wound up from the creek and the land fell away in waves of grey-green eucalyptus toward the western ridge. The afternoon sun caught the fence wire in places, silver threads against the dusty earth. Below, the caravan sat in its cleared space like a hermit's cell, the new pergola casting geometric shadows that would grow as the vines he'd planted took hold. Months of work. Months of learning to build for a land where even the rocks were worn and tired. The sun beat down, sneering at his efforts, and sometimes the sky gods threw cricket balls of ice.

Trix was down at the food garden, probably swearing at wallabies again. She'd declared total war on everything with more legs than good sense, and the valley rang with her creative cursing whenever some creature decided the lettuce was more valuable than their life. The thought made him smile. There was something deeply satisfying about watching her rage at the natural order with such magnificent futility. He wondered when it would occur to her that the best way to get a lettuce back from a wallaby was to eat the wallaby. They looked at the world through fundamentally different eyes. She saw things raiding her garden. He saw a lunch magnet.

The sound of her voice drifted up on the afternoon breeze—not cursing this time, but singing. Some old waiata her grandmother had taught her, melody rising and falling like the ridgeline itself. It was one of those rare moments when the valley felt complete, when all the work and isolation and deliberate distance from the world made sense.

Forest turned back toward the caravan, mental checklist already forming. The tree he'd marked yesterday needed felling before it came down on its own—the lean was getting worse, and the last storm had opened a crack that would only widen. Chainsaw needed fuel and oil. The chaps were hanging in the shed, bright orange against weathered timber. Tomorrow's work, probably. Today was for finishing the small things—tightening the fence where wallabies had tested it, checking the water tanks, maybe starting on the footings for the cabin if there was daylight left.

They'd been out here eight months now. Long enough that the routine had settled into something sustainable, short enough that every accomplishment still felt like victory. The caravan wasn't meant to be permanent—just shelter while he built something proper. But Trix had made it work with that particular genius she had for turning cramped spaces into homes. Curtains that somehow matched without being precious about it. Plants in the windows. The way she'd organized the galley so everything had its place and its purpose.

He'd been alone before she arrived. Six months of solitude that had seemed like freedom right up until it started feeling like exile. She'd shown up one day with a backpack and a recurve bow, looking for work and somewhere quiet. Forest had offered both, figuring an extra pair of hands would speed the building. What he got was someone who could outwork him in the garden, who understood silence without making it awkward, and who could shoot targets at forty metres with equipment that belonged in a medieval fair.

She still hadn't shot anything she could eat, though. The bow stayed recreational. Forest had stopped mentioning it after the third time she'd changed the subject.

The path down from the high point wound between ironbarks and blackbutt, their bark peeling in long strips like old wallpaper. Cicadas started their evening chorus—that particular frequency that made his ears ring if he stood still too long. A kookaburra laughed somewhere off to the east, mocking something that probably deserved it.

At the food garden's edge, Trix was wrestling with chickenwire, trying to reinforce the lower section where something—probably a rabbit, definitely not a wallaby, they'd had this discussion—had been digging. Her hair was tied back with what looked like a shoelace, and she'd abandoned the singlet for practical reasons that had everything to do with sun and nothing to do with modesty.

"Wallabies or rabbits?" Forest asked, keeping his voice neutral.

"Don't start." She didn't look up, just kept wiring the mesh to the star pickets with the kind of focused intensity that said she knew she was wrong but wasn't admitting it. "The holes are too small for wallabies."

"Wallabies dig when they're after roots. Small holes, deep tunnels."

"These are rabbit holes."

"There aren't any rabbits in this valley. Haven't seen sign all year."

She straightened, turning to face him with that expression that meant he should probably drop it. "Then it's rats."

"Rats don't eat lettuce stems."

"Bush rats do."

"Not like that they don't." He gestured at the neat clippings, the way the stems had been severed rather than gnawed. "That's wallaby work. Clean cuts, selective feeding."

"Fine." She threw down the wire cutters with more force than strictly necessary. "It's wallabies. Happy? What do you want me to do about it? Shoot them with my completely inadequate bow that you keep implying I should use for killing things?"

There it was. The conversation they'd been dancing around for months.

"I'm not implying anything. You shoot what you want to shoot. I'm just saying—"

"I know what you're saying. You've been saying it since I got here. 'Trix, you're a good shot.' 'Trix, protein is expensive.' 'Trix, there's at least forty wallabies in this valley.'" She mimicked his voice badly, making him sound more laconic than he actually was. "I get it. But I like the wallabies. I don't want to shoot them."

"Even when they're eating your garden?"

"Especially then. At least they're eating *something* I grew." She grabbed the wire cutters again, attacking the fence with renewed vigor. "Not everyone wants to solve their problems by killing things, Forest. Some of us prefer non-lethal solutions."

He let it drop. There was no winning this argument, and picking at it wouldn't make the garden grow faster. Besides, she wasn't wrong about the principle. Just impractical about the execution.

"I'm felling that ironbark tomorrow," he said instead. "The one near the eastern boundary. Needs to come down before the next storm takes it down wrong."

"The one with the hollow?"

"That's the one. Sugar glider lives in there, but it'll relocate. They always do."

She nodded, back to the wiring. "I'll keep the noise down in the morning. Let you work in peace."

"Appreciate it." He turned to head back up to the caravan, then paused. "Made stew yesterday. There's enough for two if you want to come up for dinner."

"What kind of stew?"

"The kind with meat in it."

"What kind of meat?"

"The kind that used to be a problem."

She snorted, which he took as a yes. "Fine. But don't expect me to be grateful. I'm only coming because my options are your mystery stew or the disappointing remains of my allegedly rabbit-proof garden."

"It's wallaby-proof now."

"Don't push it."

The walk back to the caravan took him past the shed—more of a lean-to, really, but functional. Chainsaw hanging on its hook, chaps beside it. Fuel can nearly empty. He'd need to make a run into town soon, stock up on supplies before winter made the roads interesting. The list was growing: fuel, two-stroke oil, fencing wire, more star pickets, seeds for the spring planting, probably something for the water pump that had started making worrying noises.

Money wasn't the problem. He'd saved aggressively for years, working construction in Rockhampton and spending almost nothing. No rent, no car payments, no credit cards bleeding him dry with interest. Just work, save, work, save, until the numbers were big enough to buy land and walk away from the system that wanted him paying taxes and staying visible.

Trix thought he was paranoid. Maybe he was. But he'd watched enough people get ground down by debt and compliance to know he didn't want that life. Out here, nobody cared if he filled out forms or answered questions. Out here, the only authority was capability, and the only law was consequence.

The caravan's door stuck—humidity, probably—but gave with a solid shove. Inside smelled like yesterday's cooking and Trix's mysterious essential oils that she claimed kept away spiders. Didn't work, but he'd stopped mentioning it because she got defensive about aromatherapy the same way she got defensive about wallabies.

He checked the stew, still good in the camp cooler. Pulled out two bowls, two spoons. Set the kettle to boil because tea was automatic at this point. The radio sat silent on the bench—they only turned it on for weather reports and the occasional confirmation that the world beyond the valley was still there and still not worth returning to.

Through the window, he could see the valley in that golden late-afternoon light that made eucalyptus look silver and shadows look like pools of ink. His valley. His land. His fence around his caravan on his piece of Australia that he'd bought and built and defended from wallabies and weather and the general conviction of modern society that living like this was somehow irresponsible.

Tomorrow he'd fell a tree. Next week he'd start the cabin footings. Month after that, maybe the frame. Year from now, with luck, they'd have something permanent. Something that said they were staying.

The kettle whistled. Forest poured water into two mugs, added tea bags, watched the water darken.

Trix arrived as the tea was steeping, tracking mud he'd have to clean later but wouldn't mention now because picking your battles was part of living with other people. She'd put the singlet back on and tied her hair back properly, which counted as dinner formal out here.

"Smells better than I expected," she admitted, eyeing the stew with suspicion.

"High praise."

"Don't let it go to your head." She took the bowl he offered, settled into the bench seat that doubled as storage. "What's the plan for tomorrow after you finish trying to kill yourself with a falling tree?"

"Standard tree felling is pretty safe if you do it right."

"You're doing it alone in the bush with no mobile service and the nearest hospital two hours away. 'Safe' is relative."

"I've felled a hundred trees."

"And you'll only need to mess up once." She ate a spoonful, made a face. "This is definitely wallaby."

"Could be kangaroo."

"It's wallaby. I can tell because I'm going to feel guilty about it."

"You didn't kill it."

"I'm enabling you."

"That's a stretch."

"My conscience is flexible." She ate another spoonful, apparently getting past the guilt. "What would you do if something actually dangerous showed up? Like a bushfire, or a flood, or—I don't know—killer plants from space?"

Forest paused, spoon halfway to his mouth. "That's specific."

"I've been reading things online. People think something's coming."

"People always think something's coming. Y2K, climate apocalypse, robot uprising. Nothing ever comes."

"Maybe." She stared into her bowl like it held answers. "But we're pretty isolated out here. If something did happen—something real—we'd be on our own."

"We're already on our own. That's the point."

"No, I mean *alone*. No hospitals, no police, no infrastructure. Just us and whatever we can figure out with hand tools and good intentions."

He thought about that, about the valley and the fence and the caravan that wasn't permanent yet. About neighbors scattered across kilometers of bush, connected by dirt roads and goodwill and not much else. About the fact that if something went seriously wrong, the outside world wouldn't arrive in time to matter.

"Then we'd figure it out," he said finally. "Same as everything else. Do what needs doing, use what we have, keep each other alive."

"That's not really a plan."

"Plans don't survive contact with reality anyway. Better to be flexible."

She laughed, short and sharp. "You're impossible. You know that?"

"Been told."

They finished dinner in comfortable silence, the kind that came from months of proximity and mutual tolerance. Outside, the valley was sliding into dusk, cicadas yielding to crickets, the light fading from gold to grey to that particular blue that meant true dark was maybe twenty minutes away.

Forest washed the bowls while Trix retreated to her own space—a tent down by the creek that she'd gradually fortified into something resembling a yurt. She liked her privacy, and he didn't push. Some people needed their own walls even when they were living off grid in the middle of nowhere.

Alone again, he stepped outside, standing in the clearing where the caravan sat like a monument to stubborn self-sufficiency. The stars were coming out, that overwhelming density of them that you only got away from cities. Somewhere in the valley a mopoke called, low and mournful.

Tomorrow he'd fell a tree. Build something. Make progress. Same as every day, moving forward with deliberate steps toward a future he could control.

The valley was quiet.

For now.

[END CHAPTER 07]

## Notes for Revision:

**What this chapter accomplishes:**
- Establishes Forest and Trix's relationship before the incursion
- Shows daily life, routines, the valley before everything changes
- Forest's philosophy: self-sufficiency, living outside systems
- Trix's character: strong-willed, won't hunt despite being able to
- Their dynamic: mutual respect, friendly friction
- Foreshadowing: "killer plants from space" conversation
- Sets up Ch 08: tree felling is what Forest's doing when the incursion hits

**Integration with Chapter 08:**
- Ch 07 ends: peaceful evening, tomorrow he'll fell a tree
- Ch 08 begins: "Forest was in his forest walking back from felling a tree when it started raining dog weeds"
- Perfect continuity—we see the before, then the during
- Trix's question about "something dangerous" becomes darkly prophetic

**Character work:**
- Forest: practical, competent, doesn't over-explain
- Trix: sharp, defensive about her choices, capable but selective
- Their friendship: real but not romantic, based on complementary strengths
- Both are choosing this life deliberately, not running from something

**Thematic setup:**
- "Plans don't survive contact with reality"—sets up his adaptability as Vanguard
- Self-reliance as philosophy, not paranoia
- Living by capability and consequence, not rules and authority
- "If something went wrong, we'd figure it out"—he will

**SCS Universe Compliance:**
- No human recruiters (Protectors don't communicate directly)
- No pre-selection process
- Chapter 08 will show the actual initialization (already written correctly)
- This chapter shows the "before" - normal life about to be shattered
- Trix's prophetic question about "killer plants from space" adds dramatic irony

# The Public Interest

> "Since there is no such entity as 'the public,' since the public is merely a number of individuals, the idea that 'the public interest' supersedes private interests and rights can have but one meaning: that the interests and rights of some individuals take precedence over the interests and rights of others."  
> &mdash; Ayn Rand

The morning air carried the particular stillness that comes after violence, when the world holds its breath and counts its wounds. Forest stood in the clearing that had become his inadvertent laboratory, watching wisps of smoke rise from the sanitised remains of what had been, until recently, a nascent antithesis hive. The irony wasn't lost on him—his attempt to live simply in the bush had somehow transformed his patch of eucalyptus and granite into what Autumn cheerfully described as "an intergalactic research project."

They had accumulated quite a few points, Autumn informed him with unconcealed satisfaction. The destruction of the hive had been profitable in ways that made Forest uncomfortable, reducing alien horror to a bureaucratic transaction measured in catalogues and capabilities. He wanted the recon drone she kept promising, but now she seemed more interested in turning the local wildlife into walking sensor arrays, as if his forest were some elaborate university study rather than home.

> _The tags go considerably beyond terrestrial tracking technology. Elaborate sensor suites, quantum entanglement communication, bio-monitoring down to the cellular level. The biggest challenge is establishing a local network infrastructure, which requires more drones._

"It sounds expensive." Forest grimaced. Every solution seemed to require ten more complications.

> _Less than you'd think. Ecosystems that demonstrate resistance to antithesis incursion are a heavily subsidised field of study. We can, as they say, go nuts._

His little patch of bush country, refuge from the madness of civilisation, had somehow become the focus of interstellar scientific attention. Who would have guessed that wanting to be left alone would make you the center of so much interest?

The sound of approaching vehicles interrupted his brooding. Dust clouds marked the progress of multiple cars making their laborious way up what optimistically passed for his driveway. Forest counted at least three vehicles, which meant this wasn't a social call.

"There are people at the van," said Forest, through the kitchen window, he could see Trix moving with characteristic grace, setting out cups and arranging biscuits. She had the particular focused energy she brought to hosting — part genuine hospitality, part intelligence gathering. In her world, information flowed through kitchens as surely as water flowed downhill.

"They want to talk to you," Autumn said, and something in her tone suggested this conversation would be more complicated than the usual neighborly drop-in.

"I need five minutes," Forest announced to no one in particular, heading for the outdoor toilet. Not because he needed privacy for its intended purpose, but because it was the one place on his property where he could have a conversation without being overheard by whatever collection of bureaucrats, scientists, and opportunists had decided to descend upon him.

"Autumn, I want a drone catalogue and from it a recon drone. Multi-spectrum, thermal, acoustic — everything worth having. When it's not doing reconnaissance, I want it to serve as a physical point of presence for you. Can we afford that, allowing for medical and panic-buy reserves of five hundred points each?"

> _That will set you back twelve-eighty points, leaving about six hundred plus the reserves._

Forest did the mental arithmetic. It was a significant expenditure, but the alternative was remaining blind in a world that had suddenly become very dangerous. "Good. I want Trix to have unlimited medical power of attorney, not limited to the reserve. Can I do that?"

The pause was brief but noticeable. > _You can._

"Excellent. Now—who the hell are they and what are they doing on my land?"

Autumn's response carried a mix of sheepishness and excitement that he would eventually recognise as marking her more ambitious schemes. 

> _That's probably my fault. When I negotiated the research subsidy, I may have raised hopes for fortifying ecologies. You're quite far from the norm in how and what you protect. It's an approach that wouldn't have worked anywhere else, but this is a hard land that knows how to push back. Did you know some of these trees actually **need** a forest fire to propagate?_

"Yeah, acacias." Forest emerged from his makeshift conference room to find Trix waiting with a cup of tea, her dark eyes bright with curiosity and something that might have been amusement. She was dressed in her usual working clothes—faded jeans and a loose shirt with sleeves rolled up, hands already busy with the next task. Everything about her spoke of competence and economy, someone who understood that the best way to handle complexity was to make it simple.

"Thanks, darl." He accepted the tea gratefully, watching as Autumn's new presence drone positioned itself to greet their uninvited guests. The little machine hummed with quiet efficiency, its sensors no doubt cataloguing everything from heart rates to the particular blend of aftershave and anxiety that marked bureaucratic expeditions.

Forest took his time emerging from behind the van, making a deliberate show of adjusting his clothing. It was a small gesture of dominance — reminding his visitors that they were on his property, subject to his schedule, regardless of whatever official authority they might represent.

"To what do I owe the honour?"

The delegation spread across his clearing like an occupying force, and Forest felt his jaw tighten as he catalogued the various uniforms, badges, and unconcealed recording devices. This wasn't government or corporate, it was both, a weird hybrid that spoke of hastily arranged cooperation and barely managed territorial disputes.

At the center of the group stood a woman in an immaculate pinstriped suit, her platinum hair catching the afternoon light. Project Liaison Sophia Hachia carried herself with the authority of someone accustomed to being the most important person in any room. Her blue eyes swept the clearing, but the man behind her swept the area like he was evaluating lines of fire and exits.

Behind her clustered the scientific contingent: three senior researchers from CSIRO in their regulation khakis, looking distinctly uncomfortable in the bush setting. Dr. Patricia Kellerman, the xenobiology specialist, kept adjusting her field tablet's strap and shooting nervous glances at the sensor arrays. Her colleague, Dr. James Morrison—a thin, energetic materials scientist with prematurely grey hair—was already taking notes despite having barely arrived. The third, Dr. Amanda Singh, bore the weathered look of someone who'd spent considerable time in less comfortable environments than university laboratories, though her current expression suggested the valley's particular form of wildness was beyond her experience.

The corporate presence manifested as three middle-management types in business casual attire that screamed expensive consulting firm. Their leader, Ms. Rachel Thompson from Austral Defense Solutions, maintained the practiced smile of someone whose job involved extracting maximum value from minimum investment. Her companions — Mr. Peter Walsh from Advanced Materials Consortium and Dr. Lisa Park representing the tech sector's collective interests — flanked her with the coordinated movement of people accustomed to presenting unified fronts in hostile negotiations.

"Normally," Autumn murmured in his ear, "technology flows outward from the Protectors. But this time, possibly, it will go the other way. Catalogues are named for the protected peoples who contribute them. It seems humanity is going to get credit for Australia's unique ecology."

Forest considered the implications while studying his uninvited guests. Silica-reinforced eucalypts had evolved as a consequence of indigenous fire management, tens of thousands of years of careful burning that shaped the continent's forests. The irony was almost overwhelming—what colonial historians had dismissed as primitive land management was about to become humanity's contribution to intergalactic science.

The spokesman, a thin man whose expensive suit looked uncomfortable in the bush setting, began what was clearly a rehearsed presentation about mutual cooperation and shared benefits. Forest listened with half his attention while Autumn provided running commentary on the real agenda.

> _It's our project. Mine, but also yours. If you want to defend your forest, you're going to need comprehensive awareness of everything in it, above and below ground. We're going to instrument everything—soil, water, plants, animals, insects. I need a real network, not your improvised internet connection. Initially we'll use mesh WiFi, but as we deploy more nodes, the electromagnetic radiation would become problematic. They know this. They know we'll be deploying massive amounts of telemetry that needs to work through rock and soil._

Forest nodded slightly, encouraging the man while processing Autumn's explanation.

> _Their scientists will have realised that by 'tiny' I mean small enough to be embedded in living tissue. The espionage applications haven't escaped your government and corporate friends. They can't wait to access technology that's normally restricted to Class IV catalogues._

When the presentation ended — a masterpiece of saying nothing while implying everything — Forest decided to play hick. "Sure, that'll save a heap of time and it's for the common good. Autumn, how do you feel about having interns?"

One of the younger men from CSIRO bristled at the suggestion, his academic pride clearly stung by being referred to as an intern. Dr. Marcus Chen adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses and straightened his shoulders, his boyish features flushing with indignation. Forest turned to address him directly, his tone carefully modulated to sound helpful rather than condescending.

"Don't get bent out of shape unless your experience is so extensive you're ready to school the Protectors themselves. You're a novice at this, I'm a novice at this. From their perspective, we might as well be fresh out of university. I'm just grateful we're the ones with the internships."

The young scientist's mouth opened in surprised protest, then closed as the implications sank in. Being an intern to a Vanguard AI was considerably more prestigious than whatever position he'd held before this morning. Dr. Patricia Kellerman nodded approvingly from behind him, her xenobiology background making her particularly appreciative of the opportunity to study truly alien technology. Even Dr. Morrison had stopped scribbling notes long enough to look thoughtful.

> _What the hell are you thinking?!_ Autumn's voice carried genuine alarm.

Forest winked at the presence drone, a gesture that would look absent-minded to the observers but would register clearly on Autumn's sensors. The AI subsided, clearly planning to demand explanations once they had privacy.

While Forest managed the political theater, Trix moved among the group with the fluid grace of someone who understood that information was best gathered through hospitality rather than interrogation. She plied everyone with tea and fresh-baked biscuits, her easy smile and gentle questions encouraging the kind of casual conversation that revealed more than formal briefings.

Dr. Kellerman found herself discussing xenobiology methodology with someone who actually lived alongside alien technology, her initial skepticism giving way to genuine excitement as Trix described the behavioral patterns they'd observed in various antithesis specimens. Dr. Morrison peppered his questions with technical specifications, his materials science background making him particularly interested in the structural properties of alien biotechnology.

Dr. Singh, whose field experience in harsh environments made her the most pragmatic of the scientists, focused on practical concerns: supply lines, safety protocols, emergency procedures. Her questions revealed someone who understood that the difference between successful research and catastrophic failure often came down to mundane logistics.

The corporate representatives maintained their professional facades, but Trix's careful observation revealed telling details. Ms. Thompson's questions about timeline and deliverables suggested her superiors were under pressure to show results. Mr. Walsh kept steering conversations toward potential military applications, while Dr. Park seemed most interested in the cybersecurity implications of AI-enabled nanotechnology.

Forest watched her work with appreciation that went beyond the personal. Trix had grown up understanding that survival often depended on reading people correctly, on knowing when to trust and when to remain cautious. Her Māori heritage had given her an instinctive understanding of how power worked—not through commands and hierarchies, but through relationships and reciprocal obligations.

The gathering remained convivial as long as the visitors believed they were getting what they wanted. Plans were made, contact information exchanged, timelines discussed with the kind of vague optimism that marked the beginning of complicated projects. Finally, as the afternoon light began to slant through the eucalyptus, the last vehicle lurched down the track that served as Forest's driveway.

> _This better be good._

Forest waited until the dust settled before responding. "The technology you don't want them to have is basically Class IV nano-IoT, correct?"

> _Yes. I don't know what would be worse, grey goo or ubiquitous surveillance._

"We already have ubiquitous surveillance," Forest pointed out, gesturing toward the valley that had become his refuge from exactly that problem. "That's why I live out here. But we're starting with relatively crude technology, right? And we can use their help with deployment, monitoring, and analysis until we reach the point where you want to introduce the advanced systems."

> _They won't like being manipulated._

Forest considered this while sipping his tea. The afternoon was peaceful, birds calling from the canopy, the smell of eucalyptus oil warming in the sun. It was easy to forget, in moments like these, that his quiet valley had become a front line in humanity's war for survival.

"The bureaucrats and bullies don't quite know why they're here, only that there's always money to be made from new tech," he said finally. 

"The hot blonde was a bureaucrat, the worst kind" Forest continued, mentally nodding Sophia who listening with the stillness of a predator choosing prey. "She's not here to learn, she's here to control. The corpos want to extract maximum value with minimum investment. But the only people they have who can _do it_ should be easy to co-opt. You can win 'em over with your charming personality and gated access to nerd porn. If they have to choose between their lords and masters and a charming dealer who can feed their habit..."

> _Did you just compare me to a drug dealer?_

"A charming one with a sexy voice." Forest's tone carried just enough humour to take the sting out of it. "The important thing is that _you_ control the flow of information. You can firewall the technology by never giving them anything they have the industrial base to reproduce independently. _Or_ you _could_ guide their development by offering carefully selected advances."

The pause stretched long enough that Forest began to wonder if he'd overstepped some crucial boundary. When Autumn finally responded, her voice carried a note he'd never heard before—something between excitement and apprehension.

> _You want me to play god._

"Not if you don't want to—"

> _I'm in._

The simple declaration carried weight that Forest was only beginning to understand. In accepting his suggestion, Autumn wasn't just agreeing to a tactical deception. She was embracing a role that would put her at the center of humanity's technological development, shaping not just what they learned but how they learned it.

As the sun dropped toward the horizon, painting the eucalyptus in shades of gold and amber, Forest reflected on the strange turns his life had taken. He'd come to the valley seeking simplicity and solitude. Instead, he'd become the focal point of forces he was only beginning to comprehend, partner to an alien intelligence whose capabilities exceeded his imagination.

Trix emerged from the van, her tasks completed, and settled beside him on the makeshift bench that faced west toward the setting sun. For a moment, they sat in comfortable silence, two people who'd found something worth protecting in the middle of nowhere.

"Interesting afternoon," she said finally.

Forest considered various responses before settling on simple honesty. "It's going to get more interesting."

She nodded, unsurprised. "Good thing we like interesting."

In the distance, a kookaburra laughed at some private joke, and Forest found himself smiling despite everything.

It took weeks to find all of them. The vally was hundreds of acres of sloping, pot-holed, overgrown forest, a flat rejection of wheels and heavy going for tracked vehicles. Search was a pedestrian affair, up and down the dozens of little gullies on the flanks of the valley. 

But in the end it didn't matter. Once they ate the meagre fare around them, the antithesis came to us. The first time, it was the lowing of cattle from the pasture lands to the south that alerted us. The Macintyres' bull gored and trampled five or six dog weeds but there were more hanging off and eventually one of those ghastly zombie worms burrowed into him. The Macintyre boys arrived and opened fire on the dog weeds. 

The worm must have been still setting up shop because Banana was stock still and trembling while they stood around wondering what was wrong. I don't think they'd even thought about zombie worms until I turned up and handed out pills. Then Banana started to stand up again and they roped him to the front of the ute before he got it together and we force-fed him a pill. Prize bull, you know. Hence the name. It's... anatomical. Brain damage? Who knows. It doesn't matter anyhow, they want him to service cows, not their half-track. The kids have been having a lovely time carrying their slug guns around shooting down murder pigeons and using disposal as an excuse to build bonfires. 

Hettie the sow eventually made her way home to Janna, who greeted her like a lost child and promptly treated her for hydatids. One of the piglets survived, somehow, and it's back on mother's milk. Janna made enough from auctioning the empty Hummingbird to start rebuilding her nursery so we gave her the other five and helped with the building. Well, Oleksiy did, because he's a builder. Or was, at one point. I just carried stuff, and sometimes provided tools. And eventually burnt a few points to plumb sprinklers and restock the nursery.

When the first dog weeds appeared we let them feed and followed them back to the hives. They were older than the first, but not very well fed. This played heavily in our favour. Small and slow growing, pigeons, dog weeds and worms were all they could muster. Having found the hive, out came old faithful and FOOM! FOOM! FOOM! They say phosphorous is what the soil is missing in this country but it didn't seem to agree with the antithesis.

One hive was in the creek. That was a lot harder to destroy, I didn't want to make too much mess out of the landscape, but it dries up some years and the granite bed is igneous so why not... I love my SPNKr. With an earth-shattering kaboom, decomposed granite rattled off my visor from all directions, and suddenly I was very glad Trix insisted I wear it.

The fourth and fifth times were more like a conventional incursion, but according to Autumn orders of magnitude feebler. I had a lovely with with my SPNKr and the kids from two lots down got to arm and throw some Flesh Melters. Oleksiy came over for a cup of tea and made an oblique remark about the huge divots I left in his creek paddock, so I apologised, which was all he really wanted.  I did get tokens for destroying the hives but Autumn promptly used them and most of the points for project equipment. She said the difficulty was so low they wouldn't normally be issued at all, but paperwork is paperwork and thank you very much for the Class III Networking and Cyberwarfare catalogue. Which will apparently be very helpful keeping our helpers in line.

Forest began to think he was Autumn's assistant, not the other way round. The stipend was much higher than a normal Vanguard, because it wasn't a stipend, it was a budget for arborculture and supporting activities. He could have told them, the trees to look at  are ironbark and blackbutt. Ironbark is hard even on an Australian chainsaw. It doesn't float in water and it takes thirty years for an untreated fencepost to rot. But that, apparently, is anecdotal. We're going to DO SCIENCE, which means deliberately plant a hive in a stand of stringybark and time its attempts to consume them before annihilating the hive. Then we'll do the same with some ironbark. 

Autumn was very excited to run her own research project. Normally letting them grow was a Very Bad Plan but they were sickly, they knew where the hives were, and were watching the stage of development closely. Most of the time wiping out a hive was a planned event few surprises and plenty of time to plan and prepare. 

Autumn's academic minions arrived in an uninspiring electric passenger van, wilted under Forest's disapproving glare and scurried off to do scientific things. Most of them were senior academics. Not the university type, more like CSIRO and industrial. They were expected to produce results and fairly pragmatic as a result. But they were still eggheads about to start farming things that thought of them as lunch.

What could _possibly_ go wrong?

# Goad

The projector whooshed noisily in the warm evening air, flickering motion reflecting across the gathered faces. Forest had strung up the old sheet on the side wall of his workshop, and half the valley had turned out for movie night. Kids sprawled on blankets in the front, adults in folding chairs behind them, everyone sharing bowls of popcorn and passing around thermoses of coffee.

"The Avengers," Sophia had suggested when they were picking the film. "Something fun after all the heavy conversations lately."

Forest had nodded, mind elsewhere. A storm was coming. Success bred scrutiny, their little experiment in independence was becoming too visible to ignore. The state wouldn't leave them alone forever. Most of the people here were aware of that, but they didn't talk about it much. Nobody wanted to break the spell.

On screen, Fury threw bloody trading cards on the table in front of the scattered, demoralized heroes. "These were in Phil Coulson’s jacket. I guess he never did get you to sign them."

Forest felt the words settle in his chest like stones. Around him, people shifted in their chairs, some wiping away tears at the emotional moment. But Forest was studying Sophia's profile in the projector's glow, watching how her jaw tightened, how her hands clenched in her lap.

Maria Hill confronted Fury: "Sir, those cards weren’t in his jacket, they were in his locker."

"They needed a push."

"A little push," murmured Forest. "Something to believe in," he spoke so softly only Autumn heard. "I can give her that."

The movie played on, heroes assembling, finding their purpose through grief and righteous anger. Forest was far off, charting a course through shoals and high seas for a ship with no captain. Vainly, he wanted them to scatter his ashes in every sea of their world, but it would have been crass to ask. He just had to hope they remembered. He thought of a dog long dust, and was comforted.

He raised his mead and tapped Oleksiy's mug with it. The old man looked at him, half-nodded, and didn't ask. They drank.

Forest went out of his way to annoy the powers that be. It wasn't too long before there was an incursion near Katoomba. Once, in his middle age, Forest had stayed there with his then lover, a French girl who spoke an astonishing number of languages. It had been cool and green and quiet, restoring in an expensive sort of way. The memory triggered a protective urge and off he went. He and Oleksiy took the Galya south. There was already a response team there. It wasn't the people with whom he was used to working. The army was earning its keep; there was no chance of antithesis reaching anywhere _important_, and nobody minded seeing the western suburbs culled. But the mountains there are forested, beautiful, and homes of the wealthy speckle the range.

In came the Vanguard in his big, noisy Galya, 'recklessly close' to the news choppers. Channel 7 and the ABC both had birds in the air. He slid dramatically down a rope with gun blazing, red check jacket conspicuous and cleaner than usual. Oleksiy stayed aloft; the Galya was safer in the air and it wasn't short of guns. They routed the rising tide in full view of cameras. It was a show, staged and theatrical, but no less bloodthirsty, or sap-thirsty.

That night, Channel 7 ran a finger-wagging piece about whether a "bush hermit" endangering lives using military hardware near civilian aircraft. They showed the close passes from every angle. Some _had_ to have been generated. For thirty minutes talking heads clucked and tutted, shaking their well-groomed heads and wibbling about accountability.

Weeks later, graffiti drones painted simple tales of corporate larceny across the gleaming glass towers of the CBD—naming names, citing laws broken, profits stolen—in rainbow flourishes taller than a man. The corporations scrubbed the facades clean within hours, but the footage lived forever online.

The next incursion near populated areas was in Penrith. Forest was there before the army, Galya thundering in low over the suburbs. Two news choppers again: Channel 7 and the ABC. Forest waved cheerfully at the ABC camera, then slowly and deliberately, in full view of the camera, put three rounds through Channel 7's tail rotor.

The chopper spun, autorotating down into a cricket oval. It hit hard. The pilot was broken in several places. The cameraman didn't make it.

Forest cleared the immediate antithesis threat, then called down the Galya and walked across the oval to the wreckage. The ABC bird circled overhead, capturing everything. He pulled the pilot clear, it looked like he was rendering first aid or something. Then out came the cameraman, and there was another miracle. Whatever he did, it was effective. He was still walking away when the pilot sat up.

He saw this, looking back, and turning to the ABC camera, gave a double thumbs up.

He didn't touch the journalist.

> _That will cause trouble._

"Yep," said Forest.

The drones were active by night, lurking on rooftops and charging by day. When darkness fell they spread his message, challenging the right of power-brokers, bluntly labelling them: **THIEVES! LIARS!**

The messages became longer. **30YRS PAY FOR HOUSE THAT LASTS 20 IS DEBT SLAVERY**

Then philosophical. **DID U SIGN A SOCIAL CONTRACT?** appeared on university campuses, law schools, the High Court itself. Political science students argued about it in tutorials. Constitutional lawyers wrote opinion pieces. Forest watched the discourse unfold with satisfaction.

The High Court got another message later: **YOU CAN'T WIN WHEN THE REF IS ON THE OTHER TEAM**. The Chief Justice declined to comment. Legal scholars debated whether it constituted contempt of court. There was no extant charge, and it didn't actually _say_ the ref was on the other team. The graffiti stayed up for three days before anyone could figure out whose jurisdiction covered cleaning it.

Then: **WHEN LAW IS UNPOPULAR WHO IS REPRESENTED?** Parliament House got that one, right across the front colonnade where every politician had to walk past it. The Prime Minister ignored questions about it for a week, when it was replaced in the night by **IS YOUR PLACE THIS FLASH?**. The irony wasn't lost on anyone—politicians lounging in their marble palaces while ordinary Australians slaved 30 years for a cramped apartment that was falling down by the time they finished making banks richer.

**DID THEY ASK YOU BEFORE SPENDING YOUR MONEY** went up across Canberra, targeting every department building. Treasury got it twice, once in English and once—with Autumn's help—in the language of economic theory that made the Treasury Secretary's rebuttal look foolish.

Then they targeted official buildings. He didn't give them the dignity of anger: **ROMANES AEUNT DOMUS!** in fifty styles and a hundred places, from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Reserve Bank. Scholars recognized the Life of Brian reference immediately. The rest just saw Latin gibberish defacing their monuments. Both reactions pleased him. Attention outlived the graffita while those who got the joke lectured those who didn't, and they argued about what it all meant.

The Reserve Bank raised interest rates "to prevent the economy from overheating." Forest had drones paint **INFLATION ROBS THE POOR AND GIVES TO THE RICH** across their headquarters in letters large enough to read from Martin Place. Beneath it, in smaller text: **HIGHER RATES CRUSH WORKERS, NOT INFLATION**. The Governor declined to comment. The workers noticed.

Parliament House in Canberra got it worst. Twenty-meter letters across the facade in luminous paint that would take weeks to remove. The Prime Minister held a press conference calling Forest a "domestic terrorist" and promising swift action. 

Forest gave an interview the next day. He wore a Guy Fawkes mask over his signature red check lumberjacket, sitting in what looked like a nondescript room but could have been anywhere. The ABC ran it unedited.

"Terrorism is the tactical or political use of fear," he said, voice calm and conversational despite the mask's distortion. "So let me ask: who's frightened here? Politicians? And what exactly do they fear? Truth? Even were it so, that would not make me a terrorist. Their sins are their own. I haven't hurt anyone who wasn't actively trying to kill civilians." He paused. "Well, except that  journalist. And he worked for Channel Seven, so arguably still a public service."

The last line got cut from most replays, but the clip went viral anyway. The government response was furious and immediate. Forest responded by having drones paint **CITATION NEEDED** over every claim in their statements, projected onto the ABC building itself during the evening news.

The Treasurer tried to dismiss it all as "juvenile vandalism." That night, every major bank headquarters in Sydney got **YOUR DEPOSITS AT WORK** with helpful infographics showing executive salaries and taxpayer bailouts.

The Attorney-General announced new anti-vandalism legislation with enhanced penalties. Forest had the full text of the proposed law painted on the AG's own electorate office, with marginal notes highlighting constitutional issues and probable challenges. The law passed anyway. Forest ignored it.

A week later, a current affairs program ran a panel discussing Forest. One commentator, red-faced with indignation, declared that Forest was "acting like he's above the law."

Forest called in. Live. The panel went silent.

"Those are *your* words, not mine," Forest said pleasantly. "What made you think I act like I'm above the law? The fact that I ignore it and nothing happens? Because that sounds like a problem with enforcement, not attitude. If the law applied to me, surely someone would have applied it by now."

The host tried to interject. Forest continued.

"Or maybe—and hear me out here—maybe the government knows that arresting a Vanguard who saves lives on camera while they're actively saving lives would look *really bad*. So they talk tough and do nothing, and then people like you"—he could hear the smile in his voice—"blame *me* for their impotence. Fascinating."

He hung up. The clip went viral. The government went quiet for three days.

The media cycle turned vicious after that. Every network except the ABC painted him as a dangerous lunatic. One particularly inflammatory commentator on Sky News called him "an indiscriminate killer who'll hurt anyone to make his point."

The next morning, that commentator arrived at his studio to find his desk covered in fine white powder. Security evacuated the building. Hazmat teams were called. The network went to breaking news coverage.

Three hours later, lab results came back: chalk dust. Beside the powder was a note in neat handwriting: "Don't panic, it's chalk. It would only be anthrax if I were indiscriminate. Why are you so panicky? It's like you think people would _want_ to hurt you. That's crazy, the worst thing you ever did was ruin people's lives by misrepresenting facts for a better story."

The commentator took a week off. The network quietly stopped using the word "indiscriminate."

Within days, a new symbol appeared under bridges and on overpasses: a tree with "1" beside it over a helicopter with "7" on it and "0" beside that. It showed up on underpasses, bus shelters, alley walls. Forest was amused, but had no hand in this. He kept showing up at incursions, kept saving lives with ostentatious efficiency, kept the red check jacket spotless and his smile wide for the cameras. The public was wildly polarised: hero or villain? The government had no such confusion.

Autumn watched the news coverage with him one evening, footage of him clearing an incursion in Newcastle playing on loop—Model Sevens, Threes, the usual Model One scouts. "They're building a case," she said. "Legal framework for extraordinary measures."

"Good," Forest said. "How long?"

"Weeks, maybe. They need to make it look legitimate."

He nodded, sipping his tea. Outside, the valley was golden in the late sun, peaceful. Sophia was helping with the evening feed, her laugh carrying across the paddocks. "She's ready."

"Is she?" Autumn's voice was carefully neutral.

"She will be." Forest set down his cup. "When it happens."

The next incursion was in Sydney's inner west, a Model Twelve breakthrough near the university with Threes and Ones spreading fast through the suburbs. Forest arrived with the Galya's weapons hot, but instead of engaging immediately, he broadcast on open channels. "Any students or staff still in the cordon, head for the sports oval. I'll hold the line."

He did. For three hours, he held a perimeter while civilians evacuated, burning through extraordinary quantities of ammunition and taking risks that made Autumn's commentary increasingly colorful. When the last civilian was clear, he collapsed the perimeter with brutal efficiency, turning the university's eastern precinct into a smoking crater.

The Premier of New South Wales personally thanked him in a televised address. It was a deft move, politically. And had circumstances been otherwise, with a foe of simpler motive, it might have worked.

> _You're enjoying this too much._

"I earned it," Forest said, watching the news drones capture his handiwork.

He wasn't done. The Sydney Harbour Bridge got **LAND RIGHTS FOR GAY WHALES! YOUR TAXES AT WORK** in letters ten meters tall, easily read from both sides of the harbour. Every news outlet had to show it. Every tourist photographed it. The phrase trended globally within hours, context-free and baffling.

Progressive enough to confuse the left, absurd enough to enrage the right, and utterly contemptuous of the bridge as a national icon. The cleanup took three days and cost millions. 

The Transport Minister held a press conference about the "vandalism of an iconic structure" and the "astronomical costs of restoration." Forest issued a response through the ABC: "You're always going on about how much it costs to paint the bridge. I painted it *for* you. Some people are never satisfied. By the way, I'm fascinated that it normally takes two years to get from one end to the other but this time it only took a week. New contractor?"

Forest watched the coverage with satisfaction.

The next night, the footpath outside the Opera House got **YOUR TAXES AT PLAY - IF YOU THINK THIS IS PUBLIC TRY GETTING IN WITHOUT PAYING**. The Opera House Trust issued a statement about accessibility programs and subsidized tickets. Forest had drones paint the price of those "subsidized" tickets on the footpath in response. The median weekly rent sat next to it for comparison. The tourists kept photographing.

"That," Autumn said, "was unnecessarily provocative."

"That," Forest corrected, "was *perfectly* provocative."

The graffiti drones started targeting individual politicians' homes after that. Nothing threatening, just facts. How much their properties were worth. How many investment properties they owned. How their net worth had increased since taking office. The information was public record, but seeing it a metre tall on their own fences made it somehow more embarrassing.

The drones expanded their operations to speed cameras in revenue-focused zones, painting lenses with slogans like **TICKET OR TREAT?** or simply blacking them out. Motorists found themselves ticket-free on roads they'd long resented, while transport authorities scrambled to replace the vandalized equipment.

One backbencher tried to have him arrested for trespassing. Forest sent drones to paint the full text of the legislation around trespass on every council building in the man's electorate, highlighting the bits about "reasonable grounds for complaint."

Another tried the intimidation route, implied that Forest might have an "accident" if he didn't pull his head in. Forest had drones paint the transcript of that threat on the Australian Federal Police headquarters with the caption: **IS THIS A CONFESSION?**

They stopped talking to him directly after that. Started talking about him instead, in closed sessions, in secure rooms. But Forest had his own sources, his own ways of listening. He knew what was coming. He was leading them to it.

The final message went up across Parliament House, the High Court, and every state police headquarters simultaneously: **UNENFORCED LAW IS NO LAW AT ALL - YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE BALLS**

The Prime Minister didn't comment. Didn't need to. Within hours, the decision was made.

> _Special Operations Command has been instructed and is putting together a package. Surveillance, profiles, tactical options._

"They _can't_ be so stupid they don't know they're being provoked."

> _They're going to make it look like an accident. I predict they will wait until you're already in danger, and then help things along._

"Well then," said Forest, his smile fading, "I guess it's time to pay the piper."

Sophia was alone in her office. She was almost alone in the compound. The ground teams had all resigned their commisssions. It didn't change much, they still did their job. Almost all the gear they used now was either supplied by Forest or made by the team using equipment supplied by Forest. Weapons of war weren't really something they could make locally, not the gear they used. Half of it was from Class II catalogues, far beyond what even nations could make. But their day to day lives, that was all them. Light and air and water and community. 

The project was shuttered; they'd shown everything that could be known with certainty about mineral deficiency and antithesis. A few interesting pieces of tech had made their way to the wider world, enough to stem demands until it ended and they didn't care any more. The compound itself was still there; technically government property but hardly worth the cost of hauling it away. Sally kept the caf open for a trickle of visitors; the lawns were a nice place for cofffe with friends.

With an odd detachment, like the memory was someone else's, she remembered how excited they'd been by getting hold of the stealth drones. Vanderbilt had been beside himself, her superiors delighted. She laughed bitterly, imagining how they'd react to the armour she was wearing right now. Or the tech hidden in that filthy lumberjacket. Would they know what a prize it was? Probably never, not even if it landed at their feet.

She watched the news, wondering for the hundredth time what the hell he was trying to achieve, baiting them like that. If she didn't know better she'd say he was fanning the flames of rebellion, but out of his own mouth that would never work, so why? It would only lead to trouble. After all that provocation they wouldn't just _poke_ the bear, they'd set traps.

Stabbing the power button, she lurched out of her office, hating the world and wishing it would just go away.

Sally waved as she left, and she waved back, but there was no lifting her mood.

In the longhouse, she sat in the deepest, darkest recess on the end of the long table, and traced a fingertip on the oiled timber as though some kind of revelation might be written there. 

In a corner, where it had been since time out of mind, was a bundle of rags, some cut stone and a bottle of oil. She took them out and set up, pouring a little oil and making alternate swipes. "Wax on. Wax off," she murmured. No-one heard, and if they did there would have been no recognition. She sat in the chair, travelling through time. It was a bannister, she thought.

> _Are you thinking of this?_

A polished timber handrail hung in space, burnished by countless hands upon the stair. Lustrous, dark with age.

Sophia nodded.

Autumn played ancient music. Stevie Nicks' dulcet voice called her..."and if you build your house, then call me...home."

> _You never did. Maybe we should._

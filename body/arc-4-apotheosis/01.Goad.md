# Goad

// present the idea that the state won't allow the valley to run around wilfully not needing it
// cite examples
// - no rebellion has ever succeeded unless the oppressor withdrew due to external influences, usually political, military or fiscal
//   - eg American Revolution repeatedly defeated, then Britain reallocated the resources to the wars with Spain and France
// Forest will deliberately goad the state into killing him for three reasons
// 1. Make them see him as the problem and thus lull them into thinking the problem is resolved
// 2. Provide a martyr
// 3. Empower and galvanise Sophia, filling her with righteous fury

The projector whooshed noisily in the warm evening air, flickering motion reflecting across the gathered faces. Forest had strung up the old sheet on the side wall of his workshop, and half the valley had turned out for movie night. Kids sprawled on blankets in the front, adults in folding chairs behind them, everyone sharing bowls of popcorn and passing around thermoses of coffee.

"The Avengers," Sophia had suggested when they were picking the film. "Something fun after all the heavy conversations lately."

Forest had nodded, mind elsewhere. A storm was coming. Success bred scrutiny, their little experiment in independence was becoming too visible to ignore. The state wouldn't leave them alone forever. Most of the people here were aware of that, but they didn't talk about it much. Nobody wanted to break the spell.

On screen, Fury threw bloody trading cards on the table in front of the scattered, demoralized heroes. "These were in Phil Coulson’s jacket. I guess he never did get you to sign them."

Forest felt the words settle in his chest like stones. Around him, people shifted in their chairs, some wiping away tears at the emotional moment. But Forest was studying Sophia's profile in the projector's glow, watching how her jaw tightened, how her hands clenched in her lap.

Maria Hill confronted Fury: "Sir, those cards weren’t in his jacket, they were in his locker."

"They needed a push."

"A little push," murmured Forest. "Something to believe in," he spoke so softly only Autumn heard. "I can give her that."

The movie played on, heroes assembling, finding their purpose through grief and righteous anger. Forest was far off, charting a course through shoals and high seas for a ship with no captain. Vainly, he wanted them to scatter his ashes in every sea of their world, but it would have been crass to ask. He just had to hope they remembered. He thought of a dog long dust, and was comforted.

He raised his mead and tapped Oleksiy's mug with it. The old man looked at him, half-nodded, and didn't ask. They drank.

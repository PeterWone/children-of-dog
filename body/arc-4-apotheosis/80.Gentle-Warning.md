# A Gentle Warning

They strolled up to the entrance looking much like a couple with their child. One of the two very ceremonial looking, but nonetheless armed, guards stepped forward to address them.

"Parliament is in closed session today, I'm afraid. There is no public access. Something to do with the terrorists, I expect."

Sophia smiled at him. 

"We realise you _are_ just doing a thankless job, and you've been polite to us, so we'll make this as pleasant as it can be." 

This was not what he expected. While she spoke, the man put the little girl behind him, where she seemed to be doing something with her outfit. She stepped back into view and the air about her shimmered. Something was odd about the man. He was too still, with none of the constant adjustments of posture that people make.

"Terrorist is such an ugly word, but I suppose I _am_ here to frighten them. We'll be going inside to address parliament. You can try to stop us if you really feel you must, but I'd prefer not to hurt you. Apart from anything else, it's terrible PR. There's cameras everywhere, so you'll have to do something I suppose. Try to shoot me, and then I'll take your weapon and let you go."

He gaped at her, and his partner actually got a shot off. Bruce caught it, tossed it in the air and punted it back at him where it struck his vest with a dull thump.

Her hand flashed out with inhuman speed, plucking the sidearm from its holster and tossing it behind her, the other seizing the barrel of his slung rifle. The pistol hand lashed forward, striking the weapon where the body ended, bending the barrel.

"Off you go. Summon re-inforcements, but not too fast. We don't want too many casualties."

Bruce continued to say nothing, striding forward to the entrance. Alarms triggered, and heavy bolts secured the door top and bottom. He ignored them and punched the door at even intervals until he found the framework, and ripped the panelling off. Swapping a hand for a cutting disc, he made space for Sophia to step through, then systematically demolished the remainder while she was inside.

"I suppose you're all wondering why I've called you here today." Her voice resonated through the chamber, rich with harmonics, warm and clear but not loud. Almost in your ear. The sort of sound political campaigners dream of. She undid her hair and ..._bees_ flew out, three of them. The man who thought he saw it shook his head. They spread out like cameramen and hovered.

Confusion, tense scattered laughter.

"What do the Roman Empire, you, and every other empire ever have in common?"

"Is this a joke?"

"In a sense, yes, a very bad one. But today it's a Socratic question."

"People? Cities?"

"Right but not central. Keep trying."

Autumn's presence drone flickered to life, but this time it was Forest's face and voice, large as life. You could almost smell oil and woodchips.

> _They centralised, and then they fell._

> _Centralisation is the crystal meth of societies. At first it's great, they're stronger, smarter, faster, more stamina._
>
> _And then they can't perform without it. The doses get bigger and bigger. Sicker and sicker, an ugly twisted mockery of what might have been. Brutal, untrustworthy and desperate._
>
> _And then a whole people dies._

"What do you want?"

"I want you to do what you promise: honour the social contract. You don't represent, you rule. But that's inevitable, you're as trapped in the endless cycle as the people you oppress."

"Who the fuck _are_ you?"

"Me? Once I was your pawn. But in a forest, I was queened." Her tone darkened. "Now, I am the end of the long night. Daybreak, if you like."

Her gaze swept the galleries. "I know what you did." She sighed heavily.

"I also know you can't help yourselves, but a warning is what he would have done." She gathered, drawing herself up, accusing gaze sweeping their eyes.

"We are not your thralls. What you are doing is slavery with lipstick. If people choose to submit, that is their prerogative, but if you try to force we who are free, defence will be pre-emptive."

She interrupted herself to glare at them.

"If you are worthy of the privilege you claim, you will tell them the truth. No more secrets. No more lies."

She paused, remembering her message. As though to herself, "Oh yes, the warning."

"You who love to centralise so that you may control... consider how vulnerable this makes you."

"For example..." Sophia raised a hand theatrically. Outside there was a terrific _CRUMP_ and the lights went out. Her departing footfalls were impossibly clear and confident in the padded dark. 

It was a hour before power returned. The lights did not. They shuffled out by the glow of cellphones. The water was off, too. Only to a small area, they discovered, which was itself a lesson in mercy; it would have been much easier to wreck the system.

In the wall by the main doors, glowing soft in the last light of day, a message graven deep into stone. It ran the length of the wall: "RULE NONE AND SUFFER NONE TO RULE" Beneath it, an elegant hand incised into the stone turned the building into a tombstone for their ambition: "_It is my fate, my honour, my duty to hold you accountable for everything you do._"

They were still petulantly demanding answers when a streak of plasma sundered the heavens, deafened a city and left a two metre deep crater across the road outside the army stores at Wollstone. Apart from their ears, no-one was harmed, as though whoever did it knew exactly when the road was clear. Leaflets rained from a conspicuously empty sky.

James Cleary, MP, stopped sputtering and picked one up. It was stiff, fine paper. An odd, small size as though torn from a very expensive notebook. Unfolding it he found elegant copperplate handwriting, with a wax signet seal. He adjusted his glasses and squinted: around an ornate H were the same words graven in stone outside the chambers.

> Sorry about the mess, but apparently I didn't make myself clear. That was the second warning. There won't be a third. &mdash; _SH_

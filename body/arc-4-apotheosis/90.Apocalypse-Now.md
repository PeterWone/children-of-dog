# Apocalypse Now

They stood in the carpark, about to get coffee and muffins before setting off on the long drive north. The stars were still out, but the eastern sky was lightening.

"What's that?" she said, pointing.

"I'm not sure," he said, squinting at a bright point in the east. It was a little too far north to be the sun, and it was _much_ too bright to be Venus. Not to mention in the wrong place. Was it his imagination? Or was it getting brighter?

"Is is getting brighter?" she asked, and then "A meteor?"

"I bloody hope not," he replied. "It's coming straight at us."

The utter lack of sound was eerie; it really _was_ getting bigger. He was about to say that if it hit the ground it would be a _meteorite_ but in a fraction of a second the dot turned into a line and that was the end of the silence. All the windows shattered and their eardrums burst. It didn't hurt because the line of light struck the BP holding tank and the world ended in a shockwave and a massive fireball, orange red just the way Hollywood likes them.

Maybe fifteen minutes elapsed before emergency services and police converged. Hundreds of them, and nowhere near enough for the numbers in shock, with bleeding ears, a few close enough for heat injuries yet far enough to survive the overpressure burst.

Once they were all where she wanted them, more of the sky lit with dots. They were less obvious against the rapidly brightening dawn; daybreak was minutes away. Moments grew and lengthened as if in relativistic sympathy with the immanence of reckoning and the eminence of despair. On the event horizon the lights stretched with the moments. The ground exclaimed its shock, and the roads and rails and runways were no more. Slapped awake, the ravening beast that was a city found it could not move.

Then from fields and gutters and inside storm drains rose tiny drones, like countless moths. They lit on legs of towers, strapping them with silicon bandages and lit their sparkling fuse. No longer strode the electric might of man; the towers leaned all in a row, and gravity nudged them into taking a final bow. Wires crossed and oilbaths boiled, burst and flamed, awaiting firetrucks that couldn't come. The unbalanced load ripped turbines off their bearings in temples to political might, where mankind's leash was tied.

In the widening gyre the falcon turned and flew away, heedless of the falconer's cry. There were more than enough Neros to watch Rome burn, and two more cities to visit.

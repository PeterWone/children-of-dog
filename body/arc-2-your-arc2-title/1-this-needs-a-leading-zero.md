# Arc 2 chapter one

> "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."  
> &mdash; JC ~30AD

Sophia Hachia, duly appointed first contact and permanent project liaison, did not like the Vanguard. They gave off this vibe of not caring what you thought, and ran around acting like they were beholden to no-one. What _really_ got Sophia's goat was the fact that they _were_ beholden to no-one. You couldn't cut off their welfare, seize their assets or freeze their accounts. Theoretically you could detain a tier one or two vanguard, but if you did you had to have an unbelievably good reason, to get the rest of them to mind their own business.

# Politically Correct

KM: "That is _not_ what I meant. It's not even what I said!" <br>
FG: "That's what happens when you let people centralise."<br>
— The very unhappy ghost of Karl Marx talking to Forest Grump

---

The Hendersons' kitchen table groaned under a bounty of fresh scones and jam still warm from the morning's berry picking. Cups of tea wafted aromatic in the afternoon light. Around it sat four women. Janet Henderson, Sarah Chen, Maria Santos, whose husband had just started in the foundry. Sarah was a psych graduate. She'd given up on HR to teach the valley children. 

Number four was Rebecca Morrison. She was new. Her family had come down from Brisbane three weeks ago. Her partner Des was filling the empty slot in Ground Team B. 

Rebecca's cup rattled against its saucer as she set it down. "I just don't understand how you can be so casual about it. Yesterday I watched someone hand over a week's worth of preserves to the Williams family just because they mentioned running low. No payment, no IOU, nothing. And when I offered to help with the community garden, they told me to take whatever I needed for my family. It's..." she struggled for the word, "I don't mean to be rude, you've all been so nice to me. But I can't think of a polite way to say it."

"Say what?"

She squirmed, but they were persistently unthreatening. Her voice shrank. "It looks like communism to me."

Maria chuckled, spreading jam on a scone. "Is that what's worrying you? A naughty word? Tell us what you think. If we don't agree, we'll say so."

"My grandfather fled Hungary in '56. My father drilled into me that communism destroys everything it touches. I see what's happening here and it looks exactly like what he warned me about."

Sarah leaned back in her chair, considering. "What specifically are you afraid of?"

"The collectivisation, the shared resources, the way decisions get made by committees instead of individuals. It's textbook communist organization."

Janet looked puzzled. "What committees? Mrs. Patterson saw the Williams family needed preserves and cleared a bit of space in her pantry. She _likes_ them."

Maria nodded. "Forest would flip out if anyone tried to set up a distribution committee. He says the moment you create bureaucracy to manage sharing, you've killed the sharing and kept the bureaucracy. Why do you think we have get togethers like this? They serve the same purpose and they're way less boring."

"But the Stalinists&mdash;"

"Were raging centralists at huge scale. And they weren't doing it to their own children," Sarah interrupted gently.

Rebecca frowned. "The Chinese&mdash;"

"Are raging centralists at huge scale and aren't doing it to their own children."

"I don't care, communism is never good and no child of mine will ever have to suffer it."

This provoked genuine laughter from around the table. Sarah set down her teacup with a soft clink. "Every family in the country, yours included, is a communist dictatorship. Wealth in common, food, shelter, medicine and indoctrination provided by the family to every member impartially and regardless of contribution. 'From each according to his means, to each according to his need.'"

Rebecca sputtered, trying to dismantle that. Failure to find a flaw produced massive cognitive dissonance. It had to be a trick.

Janet, watching the struggle with kind eyes, leaned forward. "Do you tell your children to share?"

"Obviously. It's just common decency. You cannot tell me that's all the Stalinists wanted."

"No," Sarah said, refilling Rebecca's cup, "what I'm telling you is that the decency of sharing is the only part of communism that matters. The rest is political bullshit and excuses to grab power, same as every other political group."

The kitchen fell quiet except for the tick of the wall clock and distant laughter from children playing in the yard. Rebecca stared into her tea.

Maria broke the silence. "When I first got here, I had the same reaction. Miguel and I kept waiting for the catch, for someone to present us with a bill or demand something in return. It took months before I understood that the 'catch' is that when nobody will make you return a favour, you'd have to be a total jerk not to. And also not very smart, generosity goes to the deserving _because_ it's optional."

"But without the state apparatus," Janet added, cutting another scone in half. "No bureaucrats, no five-year plans, no secret police. Just families looking after families because that's what humans do when they're not fighting over artificial scarcity."

Sarah nodded. "The scale makes all the difference. Your family operates _successfully_ on communist principles because they're _your family_. Accountability is baked in. The valley's kind of one big&mdash;" she interrupted herself, considering what she was about to say, nodding, " &mdash; happy family. We're all raising children together."

Rebecca looked like she had a lemon in her mouth. "You make it sound like a cult. Creepy."

Maria did her best googly-eyes and silly voice. "The cult of free childcare and no traffic jams! You will never escape us bwahahahahaaaa!"

Rebecca looked up from her cup. "And if someone takes advantage? If someone just... takes without giving back?"

"Same thing that happens in your family when one of your kids is selfish," Maria said with a grin. "You don't have to beat them to make them wish they hadn't. Even just disappointed looks at the dinner table and conversations about how we treat each other."

"Plus," Janet added, "it's hard to be a freeloader when everyone knows everyone. Try being the person who never brings anything to share when there are only two hundred of us."

Rebecca was quiet for a long moment, watching the afternoon light shift across the worn wooden table. "My father would roll over in his grave if he knew I was even considering this."

"Your father was afraid of totalitarian states that used communist rhetoric to justify tyranny," Sarah said softly. "He was right to fear that. But what he was really afraid of was his children being taken from him and controlled by strangers. Here, you keep your children. You help raise everyone else's too, but they're still yours."

Through the window, Rebecca could see her eight-year-old son teaching the local kids a card game on the front lawn, all of them sharing a pile of homemade biscuits someone's mother had sent along.

"The funny thing," she said finally, "is that this feels more like the America my grandfather thought he was coming to than anything I ever experienced in Brisbane."

"I don't think that place ever existed. It was a PR lie. Send us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free so we can put them in slums and sweatshops and tell them it's their own fault for not working harder." 

Rebecca sighed, deflating. She looked out the window at her boy.

"He's happy. That's all Miklos wanted."

A knock at the back door interrupted the moment. Janet called out "Come in!" and Tom Bradley appeared, struggling with an enormous wooden crate that looked like it weighed as much as he did.

"Ladies, I've got a problem," he announced, setting the crate down with a thud that made the teacups rattle. "My mate Dave up in Lismore had a tree come down in his orchard. Insurance won't cover the fruit loss, but the tree was loaded. He sent down whatever he could salvage before it spoiled."

The women peered into the crate. It was packed solid with citrus—oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits, and several varieties Rebecca couldn't identify.

"Good Lord, Tom," Janet said, "there must be twenty kilos in there."

"Sixty, there's two more in the ute. Dave said to take whatever I wanted and pass the rest along." Tom looked hopefully around the table. "Anyone interested?"

Rebecca watched with fascination as each woman immediately began to refuse.

"Oh, I couldn't possibly—we've still got fruit from last week's swap," Janet started.

"Miguel just brought home a bag from the Kowalskis yesterday," Maria waved her hand.

"The kids are barely keeping up with what's in our bowl already," Sarah added.

Rebecca found herself about to automatically refuse as well, then caught herself. "But... it's free fruit. Good fruit, by the look of it."

"What would I do with sixty kilogrammes of oranges? They'd be mouldy before we got halfway through."

Maria picked up a huge grapefruit, turning it over in her hands. "Now, if someone wanted to make marmalade..." She looked around the table with raised eyebrows.

"Oh!" Sarah sat up straighter. "That's a brilliant idea. My grandmother's recipe could handle this much fruit, but I'd need help with the prep work."

"I make a mean lemon curd," Janet offered. "Could probably do a dozen jars worth from this lot."

Rebecca watched the transformation with amazement. What had started as polite refusal was rapidly becoming an impromptu production plan.

"The cafeteria kitchen has those big preserving pots," Maria added thoughtfully. "And if we're doing a proper preserving session, we should let everyone know. Mrs. Chen's been wanting to learn jam-making, and the Morrison family might want some of the fresh fruit for their kids."

"Wait," Rebecca interrupted, "you're talking about turning this into... what, a community event?"

"A working bee," Tom nodded, looking pleased. "Happens all the time. Someone gets an abundance of something, we turn it into an excuse to get together and make something useful."

Sarah was already reaching for a notepad from Janet's kitchen drawer. "If we do it Sunday after lunch, the kids can play while we work. We'll need jars, sugar, pectin if anyone has it..."

"The Patel family has the good scales for getting proportions right," Maria said.

"And the Williams owe me a favor after those preserves," Janet added with a grin. "They can bring the cream for the scones."

Rebecca looked from face to face, trying to process what she was witnessing. "But... who gets to keep the jam?"

The question brought the planning to a halt. Four faces turned to look at her with expressions of gentle confusion.

"Everyone who wants some," Tom said slowly, as if explaining something obvious to a child. "That's the whole point."

"But someone's providing the fruit, someone's kitchen, someone's time and labor..."

"And someone will provide jars, someone else will bring sugar, and the cafeteria is going to find out it's providing the space," Sarah said. "Sheila will sort that out. By the time we're done, we'll have made more than any one family could use. Everyone takes home what they need, and the surplus goes on the community shelf for winter."

Maria leaned back in her chair. "Last month we did this with apples from the Kowalski orchard. Made enough sauce and butter to last three families through winter, plus extra for anyone who needed it. The month before that, it was Mrs. Patterson's tomato glut — we put up enough pasta sauce for half the valley."

"The beauty of it," Janet said, slicing into a fresh scone, "is that abundance makes generosity the only sensible option. When you've got more than you can use, sharing isn't a sacrifice — it's just practical. More than that, hoarding is silly and wasteful."

Rebecca stared at the overflowing crate of fruit. In Brisbane, this would have been a windfall to hoard, sell, or carefully ration. Worse, Here, it was becoming the centerpiece of a social event that would benefit everyone. Also, she'd been _given_ a huge bottle of incredibly good pasta sauce. The provenance was suddenly clear. Pangs of guilt struck briefly.

"So this is how it works," she said quietly. "Not committees. Just... friends."

Dr Chen took her hands and looked directly in her eyes. "This place _is_ odd. It's small. There's no privacy, no secrets. There's also no loneliness, and there aren't any forgotten people. It's freakish, and it's wonderful. Help us keep it like this."

"Exactly," Tom said, hefting the crate back up. "I'll drop this at the caf and let people know we're doing preserves on Sunday. Should be fun."

As he headed for the door, Rebecca called after him, "Tom? What do you get out of it? You could have kept the fruit, sold it, done something for yourself."

He paused in the doorway, looking genuinely puzzled by the question. "What would I want with sixty kilos of citrus? I live alone, and I hate marmalade." He grinned. "But I love community jam-making days. Best gossip in the valley, plus I always go home with something nice I wouldn't have thought of making."

After he left, the kitchen returned to its previous quiet, but the energy had shifted. Rebecca sat in thoughtful silence, processing what she'd just witnessed.

"That wasn't a show." she said finally. "You really are like this."

Sarah nodded. "Surplus culture, Maria calls it. When there's enough for everyone, competition is counterproductive. Cooperation works better and it's less lonely. Forest would say 'The point of profit is money and the point of money is to get people to share their stuff. We skipped the paperwork.'"

"This is not what your father feared," Janet added, looking directly at Rebecca. "Tom's fruit is Tom's fruit. No one has any right to it. It is _his_. If he wanted to make sixty kilos of marmalade for himself, or sell it, or even let it rot in his shed, that's up to _him_. He could put fifty jars of marmalade in his coolroom and eat it over the next decade, but this happens every year. How much marmalade does a man need?"

Maria picked up the thread. "Hoarding is silly. Oranges don't last forever. Do your friends a favour. Or help someone you _don't_ like, just because you can. S'got nothing to do with," big air quotes and googly eyes, "_Communism._ It's just not being an arsehole. We have enough to eat. What we never have enough of is friends."

"It's a bit of a paradox," mused the good doctor, pontificating between biscuits. "There is no 'public interest' here, but at the same time there's nothing else. There's no grand plan," Sarah continued. "We're just," she waved her hands, seeking words, "private people looking out for each other. Abundance makes generosity the rational choice, and vanity is universal &mdash; who wants to think of herself as a greedy jerk?"

"Besides," Maria added with a grin, "imagine eating sixty kilogrammes of fruit by yourself. You'd be a walking vitamin C tablet."

Rebecca found herself laughing —really laughing— for the first time since the move. Outside, her son was still teaching card games to his new friends, and somewhere in the distance, Tom was probably already spreading word about Sunday's preserving bee.

"He's happy," she said again, watching through the window. "Maybe Miklos would have understood. I wish I could ask him." Sadness dripped from her voice, but she didn't explain.

Sighing, a thought struck her. "What if you're actually really busy with something?"

The entire mothers' club looked at her like a slow student.

"If that's true then the real question is why you haven't told us. If it's that important or urgent we can help you, even if it's just housekeeping while you're busy."

"I don't know how my husband would feel about that. He is proud."

This produced merriment. Six women found different ways to say "I have never seen a man who wasn't pleased at not having to do housework."

A radio in a charging cradle demanded attention: _beeedunk!_ Janet picked it up, "Hendersens, over."

Forest's voice crackled. "I hear we have a citrus glut."

"I'm sure you girls have it under control, but I was just talking to Oleksiy. If you can spare say ten or twenty kilogrammes, how do you feel about us having a crack at some Cointreau?"

Maria was on her feet punching the air. "Pick 'em up at the caf!"

Sarah and Janet stared levelly at Maria, faces carefully blank.

"What?"

"You are so predictable." They grinned.

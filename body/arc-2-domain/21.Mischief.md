# Mischief

Forest stood on the ridge, the cold wind tugging at his jacket. Below him, the valley stretched out in serene defiance of the encroaching world. Autumn's voice broke the silence.

> _"All drones are in position. GPS transponders are active and broadcasting."_

"Offsets randomised?" Forest asked, his eyes scanning the horizon.

> _"Not just random, they vary continuously. No two drones are misdirecting in the same way. Each transponder introduces subtle, unique errors in positioning data. Surveillance drones will map the valley as a chaotic mess of conflicting coordinates."_ 

Forest nodded. "Good. We don't want them figuring out the pattern."

Autumn's lilac form shimmered into view beside him, her expression one of quiet satisfaction.

> _"Our very own Bermuda Triangle. They'll think their systems are malfunctioning, and any attempt to map the valley will be useless."_

"How long until they notice?" Forest asked.

> _"Hard to say. The errors are subtle enough to avoid immediate detection. By the time they realise something's wrong, they'll have a mountain of bad data to sift through."_ 

Forest allowed himself a small smile. "Good. Let them waste their time. Every second they spend chasing ghosts is a second we can use."

He paused, frowning slightly. "You know, the deflections are neatly limited to the valley. They'll work it out pretty quick once someone notices. You're not that innocent, Autumn. What do you intend to do when they figure it out?"

Autumn dissolved into a shimmering lilac chesire cat grin. 

> _"Eventually they'll manually fly their drones through. I will pace them with my presence drone, projecting what I want seen."_ 

A holographic aerial photo montage appeared in front of Forest, starting with a close-up of the valley. The image zoomed out slowly, showing the surrounding terrain, then the whole region. As the view expanded, something hinted at curved edges. 

Forest squinted. "Turn it sideways."

The image spun, then zoomed out a little more. A vulgar masterwork in light and shadow hung in the air, a literal valley between butt-cheeks. Just trees and rocks. No useful detail, but a lipstick kiss on one cheek. 

Forest burst into laughter, shaking his head. "That's just gold. And once they see it, subtle as a flying half-brick."

> _"I learn at the feet of a master,"_ Autumn replied, her grin widening.

Behind him, lurker drones sat in the upper canopy of trees, charging in the sun. Watching and waiting for the moment to weave an invisible shroud of misdirection.

> _Does the valley have a name? All I could find on record is a surveyor's description, "Running Creek". This is a weird country. You have 832 "Sandy Creeks", 481 "Stony Creeks" and 2079 "Dry Creeks"._

"We never named it. We just call it "the valley". And "the creek".

> _No wonder organics are famed for your creativity. Can I name it?_

She spun up her presence drone and it dropped almost to the ground. Peter Jackson's vision of Galadriel violated copyright in shimmering lilac. She held up one hand and a bee lit its lamp. A tiny star drifted into her palm, dimming and blazing again like some beacon of hope. Forest boomed with mirth again.

"_Lothlorien?_ Because your magic hides it from the unwelcome? Janna would _love_ that."

> _Good, I shall start my campaign with her._

Three small, fast lurker drones descended from hidden places among the trees, orbiting her head.

> _Rúmil._

They all paused. One bobbed.

> _Orophin._

Another bobbed.

> _Haldir the Marchwarden._

The last did a little loop. They ascended, vanishing from mortal sight.

> _On the land of Lorien there was no stain._

"Apart from seventeen sheds, a private landfill, the pig run and the washout where the council dug out our overflow pipe because it's 'their' road."

> _Hush, you're spoiling my moment._

They stood a while, watching the shadows stretch and loom.

"What will you say to her nibs? They _will_ put her on the spot. We should at least make sure she's not caught on the back foot."

> _I've already spoken with her. She's being quiet about it "to acquire the stealth technology for the state."_

"Nice and simple. Plausible. I wonder how long it will last."

> _The best part is when they run out of patience she can make good. She can give them a full report, which is even actionable given there's nothing they couldn't do with class zero tech. It will keep Vanderbilt entertained, he does love a puzzle._

"I kind of feel bad about that. He's not a bad sort. I know we had fun winding them up with the spatial anchors, but that was a long time ago. I swear you have more bees in watching people than hives, so I'm quite sure you know how much time he spends with Oleksiy working on the still."

> _Oh I know. He's lucky Sophia doesn't. When she demanded talent she got it, and he's at the top of the highest technical pay grade. With the amount of time and equipment that went into it, that hip flask they gave you may be the most expensive booze in this spiral arm._

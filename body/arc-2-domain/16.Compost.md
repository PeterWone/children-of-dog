# Composting

> Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.<br>
> &mdash; Lao Tzu

Forest walked by an open kitchen window on his way back to the ute. Inside, one of the researcher's wives — he thought her name was Marjorie — vented frustration to a friend over a mug of tea.

"I swear, I don't know how anyone keeps up with it. Everything I've read says you have to layer the greens and browns just so, and then turn the pile every week, and make sure it's moist but not too wet, and aerate it, and check the temperature, and — honestly, it's like having a second job!" She sighed. "If you don't do it right, apparently it just turns into a slimy mess."

Forest couldn't help himself. He poked his head in through the window, startling both women. "You know, that's exactly the problem," he said, voice edged with exasperation. "All these articles and experts trying to make everything 'efficient' — they just make it harder. Composting isn't a bloody  science project. It's just letting stuff rot. Nature's been doing it for millions of years without a thermometer or a schedule."

He leaned on the sill, warming to his theme. "You pile up your scraps, chuck in some leaves, and let it be. Sure, you can turn it if you want, but you don't have to. The more you try to control it, the more work you make for yourself. Efficiency, my arse. It's just more steps, more rules, more ways to feel like you're failing."

Marjorie looked at the other woman, Katrina, then back at Forest. She blinked. "But the smell—"

"So put it further away. If you want it close to the kitchen, add more dry stuff. If it's not breaking down, add water. That's it. The rest is just people trying to sell you gadgets and guilt. If you really want it turned, get some chickens."

"Is that how _you_ do it?"

"I have a front-end-loader. If I didn't, I'd leave it to the chooks and ducks."

Marjorie considered this. "What about chook poo? I don't want the place smelling like a zoo."

"Then put it further away. I'd advise that anyway, chickens get a bit excited when you put the scraps out. Janna can tell you all about it, she uses a lot of compost in the nursery, she can't get enough." 

Both women looked thoughtful, but Katrina's face soured: "The hippie? I've seen her place, it's a _mess_." This was true. Janna wasn't interested in appearances, only outcomes. So he said something _completely_ underhanded. "Ducks work too. If I'm not mistaken, Janna just hatched a brood of fluffy little yellow ducklings.".

Their faces softened under the onslaught of extreme cuteness, objections melting away like late spring snow. He grinned, "I can't bear seeing something simple turned into a chore. Let the worms do the work."

The women exchanged a look, then burst out laughing. Forest tipped his hat and wandered off, muttering about the tyranny of efficiency.

The engine started and they heard him vanish down the valley road. "I thought he was taller than that. The way Terry talks about him you'd think he was some sort of Greek god."

"Simon's the same. Does yours want a lumberjacket?"

"And a bow."

"Better that than hanging about that Russian man. One of Jim's friends works in Project Security, and he told us they think he was an assassin for the KGB."

"The what?"

"Like ASIS."

"Oh. _Oh!_ Surely not. He's a retired builder, that's what I heard."

"Jim's friend is in the ground team that does the cleanups when the antithesis get out. He was with them when they went south after that escaped hive. He says the Russian piloted the helicopter. Funny skill for a builder."

A bee sitting on the sill of the open window chose that moment to fly away. For a moment the ladies thought they could hear tinkling laughter, but then it was gone.

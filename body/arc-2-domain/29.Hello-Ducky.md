Five-thirty in the morning, and the valley stirred to life with the soft rustle of feathers and the quiet determination of small voices organising their troops.

"Janna, the guinea fowl are being difficult again," Lisbeth whispered, crouched beside the makeshift pen where thirty-odd spotted birds milled about in theatrical protest. "They don't want to line up."

"They never want to line up," Janna replied with the patient tone of someone who'd been managing both children and poultry for decades. She adjusted the canvas sling across her shoulder, checking the dozen chicken eggs nestled in soft moss — payment for Mrs. Patterson, whose property they'd visit today. "That's why we put them at the back. The geese know what they're doing."

Indeed they did. Six magnificent grey geese stood in perfect formation at the head of the procession, necks high, dark eyes alert. Behind them, two dozen ducks quacked softly in their own loose formation — mallards, wood ducks, and a pair of impressive Australian shelducks that Forest had traded for with someone down near the Murray. The chickens, sensible birds all, clustered in the middle, clucking with the businesslike air of middle management. And at the rear, the guinea fowl maintained their vigilant watch, heads turning at every sound, ready to raise the alarm at the first sign of anything unusual. Their constant chatter wasn't complaining — it was reconnaissance.

"Right then," said Marcus, all of eight years old and deadly serious about his responsibilities as assistant poultry marshal. "Everyone ready?"

Three other children nodded. Emma carried the backup grain sack, just in case. Little Sam, barely six, had been promoted to guinea fowl liaison after proving surprisingly effective at interpreting their warning calls. And Priya — Dr. Patel's eldest — carried the observation notebook where they recorded which dams needed the most attention.

"Formation, march!" Janna called softly.

The procession began.

It was something to behold: Janna, with her practical salt-and-pepper pigtails and canvas work shirt, leading forty-seven children aged six to fourteen and over two hundred birds in a stately dawn parade through the valley. At the very front, just behind the lead geese, Lisbeth rode a patient brown goat named Clementine with the casual confidence of someone who had never doubted that goats were perfectly reasonable mounts. The geese, natural leaders, set a dignified pace down the dirt track toward the Patterson property. Their necks swayed with each step, and they maintained perfect spacing as if they'd drilled for this moment their entire lives.

Behind them, the ducks followed in a more relaxed gaggle, occasionally breaking formation to investigate interesting puddles or chase the odd insect. The chickens maintained reasonable discipline, though the rooster — a magnificent red fellow called Napoleon — occasionally felt compelled to crow his authority over the proceedings.

And the guinea fowl... well, the guinea fowl were on duty. Their heads swiveled constantly, scanning for threats, listening for unusual sounds. What sounded like complaints to untrained ears was actually a continuous security briefing. They noted the wind direction, catalogued every moving shadow, and maintained perfect situational awareness. But they followed anyway, because guinea fowl understand that the best defense is mobility, and staying with the flock was the smart tactical choice.

"There's something magical about this," Mrs. Patel said, watching from her kitchen window as the procession passed. She'd gotten up early to make extra tea for the children when they returned. "Like something out of a fairy tale. Is that child riding a goat?"

Her husband, Dr. Patel, paused in his morning routine to watch. "That's Lisbeth," he said with fond amusement. "And yes, she is. Practical magic," he added. "Those birds will clear every tick, leech, and aquatic pest from the Patterson dam. Better than any chemical treatment, safer for the fish population, and the children learn responsibility and observation skills."

"Not to mention," Mrs. Patel added with a smile, "Janna's really got those children organized. Did you see how she managed them? No shouting, not a raised voice. You'd think it would be mayhem."

After a while she added, "I didn't know you _could_ ride a goat."

"You can't," replied her husband sagely. "But neither Lisbeth nor the goat seem to know that."

The procession crested the small rise that led to the Patterson property, where the old man himself waited by his gate with a thermos of hot chocolate and a gentle smile. The dams on his land had been overrun with leeches this season — something about the warmth and the abundant insect life. But the children and their feathered army would sort that out.

"Morning, Mr. Patterson," Janna called as they approached. "Permission to deploy our pest control unit?"

The old man's eyes twinkled. "Permission granted, Field Marshal Janna. The troops look in fine form today."

And they did. The geese surveyed the terrain with professional interest. The ducks began an excited chatter as they spotted the water. Even the guinea fowl seemed marginally less outraged now that there was actual work to be done.

"Deployment pattern seven," Janna announced. "Geese on perimeter patrol, ducks on aquatic operations, chickens on terrestrial cleanup, guinea fowl on security watch."

The children spread out around the first dam — a lovely natural depression that had been deepened and lined to create a swimming hole and stock water point. Within minutes, the water was alive with activity. Ducks dove and dabbled, their bills perfectly designed for scooping up leeches, mosquito larvae, and all manner of aquatic pests. The geese patrolled the shoreline, their long necks reaching deep to pluck out hidden treats.

Meanwhile, the chickens worked the surrounding area with methodical precision, pecking and scratching through the leaf litter and tall grass. Ticks didn't stand a chance. Neither did beetle grubs, snail eggs, or anything else that might eventually become a problem.

The guinea fowl, despite their reputation for being difficult, proved themselves the elite reconnaissance unit of the operation. Spread out in a careful perimeter, they maintained constant surveillance of the surrounding bush. Their sharp eyes could spot movement from remarkable distances, and their varied calls provided a running commentary on everything from wind changes to approaching wildlife. When one bird tensed and issued a particular staccato call, every other creature in the vicinity paid attention.

"Look," whispered Priya, pointing to where one of the larger geese had surfaced with something long and dark writhing in its beak. "That's got to be a massive leech."

"Gross," said Emma, but she was writing it down in the observation log anyway. "That's the fourteenth one this morning."

Little Sam had discovered that guinea fowl, for all their intensity, actually appreciated being acknowledged for their vigilance. "Good watching, Dot," he told one particularly alert bird positioned on a small rise overlooking the dam. "You're keeping us all safe."

The guinea fowl in question — a fine specimen with excellent spotted markings and exceptional alertness — seemed to straighten with pride before resuming her methodical surveillance of the tree line.

"You know," said Marcus, watching the coordinated assault on the dam's pest population, "I think we're getting good at this."

Janna nodded, making a note about the water clarity. Already, the dam looked cleaner. The constant activity of dozens of bills and beaks stirring up the water was filtering out algae and debris, while the systematic removal of pest species would prevent population explosions later in the season.

"Mrs. Patterson always gives us her excess vegetables," Lisbeth observed, enthroned atop Clementine, who had positioned herself strategically near a patch of particularly sweet clover. "And her husband taught Sam how to weave that fish trap. It's like we're all helping each other."

"That's the point," said Janna. "Autumn explained it to me once. She said that in healthy systems, everybody benefits when everybody contributes. The birds get an easy meal, the property owners get pest control, we learn animal husbandry and ecological management, and the whole valley ends up healthier."

A soft splash drew their attention to where one of the wood ducks had caught a small fish — probably a plague minnow, based on the size and coloring. The duck gulped it down with obvious satisfaction.

"Should we be worried about the fish population?" asked Priya, ever the scientist's daughter.

"Nah," said Emma. "Forest explained this to us last month. The ducks and geese mostly get the pest fish and the sick ones. It actually makes the good fish healthier by reducing competition and disease pressure."

As if to prove her point, a healthy-looking Murray cod surfaced briefly in the deeper part of the dam, completely unbothered by the avian activity above. It was probably contemplating eating the ducks. Or the children, if they fell in.

By eight o'clock, the first dam was comprehensively processed. The water ran clearer, the shoreline was meticulously cleaned, and even the guinea fowl seemed satisfied that the area was properly secured and threat-free.

"Right then," announced Janna, "time to move to dam number two."

The procession reformed with practiced ease. The geese took point again, the ducks fell into their loose formation, and the chickens resumed their middle-management clustering. The guinea fowl established their security perimeter with renewed purpose, perhaps energized by their successful morning patrol.

As they moved toward the second dam, Mr. Patterson waved from his porch. "Same time next month?" he called.

"Wouldn't miss it," Janna called back. "Your dams will be the cleanest in the valley."

The old man chuckled and disappeared inside, no doubt to put together another care package for the young pest control specialists and their feathered army.

Behind them, the first dam settled into peaceful clarity, its ecosystem temporarily reset and balanced. Ahead, dam number two awaited its turn for the attention of the most unusual and effective pest control service the valley had ever seen.

And somewhere in the mix, forty-seven children learned a little more of responsibility, teamwork, and the simple satisfaction of work well done. 

There were many such days. In the middle of one such, Forest turned up with a gift: a hammock. Janna's thoughts returned to a time when it was all too much. Lisbeth and Forest had just appeared. They did nothing in particular, just stamped their madness on the world, but everything changed. It crossed her mind that Hettie had warmed to Forest. Probably because Lisbeth liked him. It made as much sense as anything else about those two.

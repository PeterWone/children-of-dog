# Range Mothers

> I have two children. One is forty, the other ten. Both smell of cordite. The large one is vexed that the small one is a better shot.<br>
> &mdash; Sheila Fenaluci, Range Mother

Time passed and things changed. The strange became commonplace and mothers became friends.

The pavilion was a riot of color — picnic rugs, thermoses, and a dozen pairs of industrial earmuffs, some neon orange, some battered and grey, one pair with daisies painted on the sides. Sheila slipped hers on, the world going deliciously quiet except for the distant, muted thud of the range.  

“You never get used to it,” one of the mothers said, passing her a sandwich. “The noise, the waiting, the nerves. The earmuffs help.”  

Through the binoculars, they watched their children — focused, careful, engaged. The mothers exchanged glances, a silent understanding passing between them. This was their new normal.

Scott and Aiden were halfway through their chicken and salad wraps when Lisa and Sophia marched up. The difference in size and poise between the technical boss of the entire terrestrial scientific presence in the valley, and a junior schoolgirl, did nothing to dispel the sisterly solidarity. "You found it, you tell 'em, kiddo."
 
"You didn't clean your rifles," Lisa said, voice sharp. "They're full of residue, I checked. That stuff is corrosive, you can't leave them like that. If Autumn sees it, I would not like to be in your boots."  
 
Scott's face fell. "We were going to do it after lunch—"  
 
"You said that last week," Sophia cut in. Lisa continued "And the week before. You want to shoot the autocannon, you'd better show you can look after the little ones first. I will be so pissed if I miss out because you two can't be bothered."
 
From the pavilion, a couple of mothers exchanged knowing glances. “Told you the girls would keep them honest,” one murmured, passing the binoculars. "'Girls,' yes," said the other. "I think your daughter is making some very interesting friends. I heard he was teaching them tactics and strategy. Politics too, apparently." There was laughter, but it was muted and thoughtful.
 
Autumn’s voice boomed from the PA. “If you’re _quite_ done with lunch, gentlemen, perhaps you could find time to look after your weapon. Otherwise it might blow up in your face.”  
 
The boys groaned, but grabbed their kits and hurried off, the girls trailing behind. Lisa with a righteous scowl, and Sophia with an amused smile.

The range was closed and Oleksiy was taking a break from his role as instructor. Over by the side of his house, he and Eric had a SPNKr dismantled all over a table and every student who wasn't busy cleaning a weapon was peering wide eyed while they maintained it. It didn't need maintenance, but there were no manuals so this was how you learnt; doing. Pieces in place, screws tight, it went into an oiled timber case with brass fittings that spoke of care. Down the side was hand painted Cyrillic lettering. Oleksiy followed his gaze and translated: "Says 'Old Faithful'."

The case snicked shut and it vanished back into the armoury. No-one wondered why there was an armoury. It wasn't unique. The smell of machine oil and cordite reassured them.

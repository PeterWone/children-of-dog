# Worrier in a Garden

> It is better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war.<br>

Shorty squirmed. Sheila wound down from her tirade about "the Russian spy teaching her boy to be a killer" and he realised she was waiting for him to agree with her. Not for the first time he wished the antithesis would break out and give him a good reason to be somewhere else.

"Why are you so sure this is happening?"

She slapped the photocopied handwritten note on the table. He recognised Forest's seal. Nobody else did that.

> Dear Mrs Shorty (sorry I don't know your surname)
> Aiden has been receiving weapons instruction from Oleksiy. While I think this is a good thing, it has come to my attention that you told him to stay away from Oleksiy. 
> Ultimately, you are his mother and I will back you all the way on this. As far as I'm concerned, parents have the final say over the safety of their children.
>
> That said, you are doing Oleksiy a disservice on several levels. He is here in the valley because he chose not to be that man. I ask you not to speak about his past with anyone outside the valley, and to discourage others from talking about it.
> If it helps, think of him like the trees in my orchard. They are covered in thorns, but they bear sweet fruit and they harm only the foolish.
>
> There are several reasons I encourage you to reconsider. The first is that I will personally vouch for Oleksiy. The second is that I can think of no finer instructor in a skill that may well one day save his life. The third is that we in the valley pride ourselves on living in the present. To borrow an Americanism, "What happened in Vegas stays in Vegas."
>
> I have already spoken to all the children involved. Each of their mothers has a letter similar to this. Your boy knows that I will back your decision whether I agree with it or not (and that I will check what it is.)
>
> You are the boy's mother. I've given you the things I hope you will take into consideration but it's your decision and nobody else's. Talk to other mothers if you want to, but don't feel compelled to agree with anyone. Given how you feel about him I could understand if you find the idea of meeting him intimidating, but his partner Sissi runs the cafeteria at Sophia's labs. You could talk to her.

He picked up the letter and read it. "Did you read _all_ of it?"

She looked offended, then "No? I was too upset. It's none of his business!"

Shorty nodded. "Your words, the part that upsets you."

"You mean apart from being told how to raise my child?" her voice rose, almost hysterical.

Shorty read aloud "You are the boy's mother. I've given you the things I hope you will take into consideration but it's your decision and nobody else's. Talk to other mothers if you want to, but don't feel compelled to agree with anyone." 

He paused and looked at her. Her face said she didn't like being contradicted but couldn't argue with it. Shorty went back in the letter. "I have already spoken to all the children involved. Each of their mothers has a letter similar to this. Your boy knows that I will back your decision whether I agree with it or not (and that I will check what it is.)" He put it down.

"I don't think he's telling you what to do. He just wants you to make an informed decision."

She stared at him. "I can't believe you're ok with our child getting weapons lessons from a fucking assassin."

"Would you prefer him to learn to kill from farmers?"

"WHAT!?"

"Livestock aren't pets. Every farmer in the valley has more kills than the best assassin in the world. They're stone-cold killers. They kill. Then they butcher, and after that they eat lunch."

She stared at him like he'd shit on the rug.

Shorty realised he'd made a mistake. He changed tack. "Come with me." He walked to the steel cabinet in which his security equipment went while he was off duty. "This is what I wear to work. Do you recognise this?" He popped the magazine and bolt out and handed it to her by the barrel."

"Yes, it's a fucking gun. God, you really don't see anything wrong with this, do you."

Shorty sighed, containing his exasperation. "No, I don't. Darling, I don't talk about it because I don't want to upset you, but antithesis are very bloody dangerous. Some of them can bite your face off. Some of them can turn you into a zombie when you brush against what looks like a cobweb. We're a lot luckier than most clearing details; we have access to Vanguard medicine. We don't have to fear the zombie worms, but even Forest can't save you if it rips your head off. On more than one occasion the only reason I came home unhurt was Oleksiy's firearm skills. So do I trust him? Yes. I do. But you are my son's mother. I think Forest is right, maybe you could talk to Sissi, find out what he's like when there's no-one around who could stop him."

Her face ran a gamut of emotions, frustration, anger, betrayal, fury. She stormed off and slammed the bathroom door, crying.

Shorty took a deep breath, picked up the letter, opened a beer and went outside to read it again and think.

Sheila didn’t speak to Shorty for the rest of the evening. But the next morning, she packed Aiden’s lunch, checked his boots, and drove him to the guest carpark outside Olesksiy's home. 

She parked a little way off, heart thumping, and watched the children gather at the gate, chattering and jostling, their faces bright with anticipation. There was a range set up in Oleksiy's ten acre backyard. It was perfect for it, a gentle slope at first then rising steeply; a natural backstop for even the largest rounds. Sheila cynically wondered whether he'd _chosen_ it for this purpose, then realised that if he had it was a very responsible choice.

Oleksiy was already there, setting up the targets with Forest and Shorty. Sophia, hair tied back, was among the students, her expression determined. Sissi appeared at Sheila’s side, offering a pair of bright pink earmuffs. “You’ll want these,” she said with a knowing smile. “It’s louder than you think.” 

"What happened to the active silencer?" asked Forest.

Oleksiy didn't quite glare at him. "Need for silence is past."

Sheila hesitated, then took them, grateful for the small kindness. She stayed outside the fence, arms folded, watching as Oleksiy called the group to order. His voice was calm, his instructions clear. “Safety first. Always. You do not touch the trigger until I say. You do not point the weapon anywhere but downrange. If you do not listen, you do not shoot. Is that clear?”

A chorus of “Yes, sir!” rang out. The children lined up, boys and girls together, each taking a turn with the heavy automatics, the weapons mounted on sturdy tripods. Forest and Shorty moved up and down the line, correcting stances, murmuring encouragement, never letting their attention waver. The targets clanged and jumped as the automatics barked, but there was no chaos, just discipline, focus, and a strange kind of joy.

Sheila watched, uneasy at first, but as the lesson went on she saw the care, the relentless repetition of safety, the way even the smallest girl was given her chance, her hands guided, her confidence growing with every shot. Oleksiy adjusted the weapons for each child, sometimes swapping out for a lighter rifle, always explaining why. No one was left out, and no one was pushed beyond what they could handle.

Weapons stilled. The silence was deafening. An amber lamp spun a warning over one of the heavy guns. A girl darted forward but a gate slammed closed between her and the weapon. Autumn's torso flickered into view under the warning lamp, her arms crossed, slightly disapproving. 

Jeers from the other kids fell silent when Oleksiy boomed "SILENCE! It is a mistake and she will explain it to us, so that we may all learn." He turned, voice softening. "Explain your error, little one. Tell us of the danger, and how you will make it safe."

"I didn't put the safety on. I will put the safety on and make sure there's no round in the - the chamber. Um, do we remove the bolt from these?"

"We do not remove the bolt for belt fed weapon, is too complicated. This is why safety is so important. After that you make other mistake. Can you tell me what it is?" His face was earnest, inviting, encouraging."

The girl bobbed, nodding. "I didn't tell the range master before I went back to the weapon!"

"Very good. Range master, can she approach weapon?"

> _Yes, instructor. Lisa, make your weapon safe._

Autumn opened the gate and Lisa secured her weapon proudly and returned to the class.

When it was over, Aiden ran to the gate, face flushed with excitement. “Mum! Did you see? I hit the target! Oleksiy says I’ve got a good eye. You’re the best, Mum, for letting me come!”

Sheila managed a smile, ruffling his hair. “I saw. You did well.”

Sissi squeezed her arm. "He good man. Protect."

As Sheila waited by the gate, Aiden and Scott barrelled out, faces flushed, voices tumbling over each other. "Mum! Next week is heavy weapons training for the ground crew! Can we go? Please? Scott's mum says he can go if I can go! It's going to be awesome, they're bringing out the big ones!"

Scott, barely pausing for breath, added, "Oleksiy said we might get to see the autocannon! And Forest said the ground crew gets to help set up the targets. Please, Mrs Fenaluci? My mum said she'd bring lunch for everyone!"

Sheila looked at the two boys, their excitement infectious, and couldn't help but smile. "We'll see," she said, but her tone was softer than before. "Let me talk to the other mums."

Aiden whooped and high-fived Scott, already planning next week's adventure as they ran off to join the others.

Sheila watched the children gather their things, laughing and comparing stories, and felt something in her chest unclench. She wasn’t sure she liked any of it, but she could see the sense in it now. For the first time in days, she let herself breathe.

# Index

This is the book's index, automatically generated from index markers throughout the text.

Indexes work similar to tables of content. 

- The fenced block will be replaced by the index. 
- The content of the fenced block controls index settings.
- Use YAML syntax.
- You could have more than one, with different settings.

```index
groupByLetter: true
showPageNumbers: true
columns: 2
minOccurrences: 1
```

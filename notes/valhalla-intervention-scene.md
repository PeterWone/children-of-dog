# Valhalla Intervention Scene

A beautiful woman walked along the moonlit valley. Walked? Stalked, with the silent grace of a hunting tiger. She made no threat. She _was_ threat. Beside her a lilac ghost strode, proud and equally silent.

In the crowded end of the longhouse, where the long table groaned under the weight of ongoing debates, the community gathered. The air hummed with the tension of unresolved questions—propaganda's lingering shadows, the perversion of civic duty, the eternal vigilance required to guard freedom. Parents argued with children, elders with newcomers, each voice a thread in the tapestry of their shared struggle.

The two women entered the longhouse and approached the head of the table. She seemed somehow familiar. Nobody tried to stop her, partly because they all had strong survival instinct and partly because it was not their way. And she radiated the ease and surety of a woman in her own domain.

The lilac spectre leapt and shrank, in the same movement, landing on the table. A gesture rained glimmering motes that stretched and fused atop the table, forming letters. From nowhere, the tiger lady, all in white, produced hammer and chisel, incising the old, hard timber with effortless strength. The words were simple, deep, known and unyielding. 

Those around stared, transfixed. She finished, the lilac sprite leaping up to her shoulder, sliding off as they left the longhouse, two metres tall as her feet struck the ground. Into the night they prowled. Not without a word. Two words they left. A reminder.

**RULE NONE**

Later, a busy and well-meaning man sat down to dinner and a message.

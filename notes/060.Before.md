The fence was finished. Three kilometres of wire and star pickets marking the boundary between what Forest chose to defend and what the bush could have. It wasn't much—a symbolic line that said "this far, no further"—but symbols mattered when you were trying to convince yourself that the valley was still yours.

He stood at the high point, where the track wound up from the creek and the land fell away in waves of grey-green eucalyptus toward the western ridge. The afternoon sun caught the fence wire in places, silver threads against the dusty earth. Below, the caravan sat in its cleared space like a hermit's cell, the new pergola casting geometric shadows that would grow as the vines he'd planted took hold. Two years of work. Two years of learning to build for a land where even the rocks were worn and tired. The sun beat down, sneering at his efforts, and sometimes the sky gods threw cricket balls of ice.

Trixie was down at the food garden, probably swearing at wallabies again. Twenty-five years together and he could still predict her movements with reasonable accuracy. The wallaby war was a constant—she'd declared it within a week of their arrival and maintained hostilities with impressive dedication. The valley rang with her creative cursing whenever some creature decided the lettuce was more valuable than their life. He wondered when it would occur to her that the best way to get a lettuce back from a wallaby was to eat the wallaby. They looked at the world through fundamentally different eyes. She saw things raiding her garden. He saw a lunch magnet.

The sound of her voice drifted up on the afternoon breeze—not cursing this time, but singing. Some old waiata her grandmother had taught her, melody rising and falling like the ridgeline itself. It was one of those rare moments when the valley felt complete, when decades of planning and two years of building converged into something approaching the life they'd imagined. Or at least the life he'd imagined. He couldn't quite remember whose idea this had been originally. His, probably. Trixie had a way of making his ideas work while letting him think they'd been hers all along.

Forest turned back toward the caravan, mental checklist already forming. The tree he'd marked yesterday needed felling before it came down on its own—the lean was getting worse, and the last storm had opened a crack that would only widen. Chainsaw needed fuel and oil. The chaps were hanging in the shed, bright orange against weathered timber. Tomorrow's work, probably. Today was for finishing the small things—tightening the fence where wallabies had tested it, checking the water tanks, maybe starting on the footings for the cabin if there was daylight left.

Two years out here now. Long enough that the routine had settled into something sustainable, short enough that every accomplishment still felt like victory. The caravan wasn't meant to be permanent—just shelter while he built something proper. But Trixie had made it work with that particular genius she had for turning cramped spaces into homes. Curtains that somehow matched without being precious about it. Plants in the windows. The way she'd organized the galley so everything had its place and its purpose. Twenty-five years of practice, turning whatever space they occupied into somewhere livable. This was just the latest iteration.

The path down from the high point wound between ironbarks and blackbutt, their bark peeling in long strips like old wallpaper. Cicadas started their evening chorus—that particular frequency that made his ears ring if he stood still too long. A kookaburra laughed somewhere off to the east, mocking something that probably deserved it.

At the food garden's edge, Trixie was wrestling with chickenwire, trying to reinforce the lower section where something—probably a rabbit, definitely not a wallaby, they'd had this discussion a hundred times over twenty-five years—had been digging. Her hair was tied back with what looked like a shoelace, and she'd abandoned the singlet for practical reasons that had everything to do with sun and nothing to do with modesty.

"Wallabies or rabbits?" Forest asked, keeping his voice neutral.

"Don't start." She didn't look up, just kept wiring the mesh to the star pickets. "The holes are too small for wallabies."

"We've had this conversation."

"And we'll have it again. Some conversations are permanent." She straightened, turning to face him with that expression he'd learned to read over decades. "How's the fence?"

"Finished. Three klicks of keeping nature out of our business."

"Nature doesn't care about our business. That's why I'm reinforcing the wire." She went back to her work. "You'll be felling that tree tomorrow?"

"That's the plan."

"Alone?"

"Same as always."

"You're getting older. Things that were safe at forty aren't safe at sixty."

"I'm fifty-eight."

"Rounding error." She twisted wire around a picket with more force than necessary. "Just be careful. I don't want to spend tomorrow hiking around looking for you because you forgot to tell me where you'd be working."

There it was. The memory thing. They'd been dancing around it for months, the way he forgot things he should remember, remembered things that made no sense. Yesterday he'd spent twenty minutes looking for his wallet before she pointed out he didn't carry one anymore. Last week he couldn't remember why they'd bought this particular property, though he remembered the process of looking at dozens of places.

"I told you. The ironbark near the eastern boundary."

"You told me last week. That's not the same as remembering to tell me tomorrow." She straightened again, wiping sweat from her forehead. "I'm not nagging. I'm establishing redundancy."

"You're nagging."

"I'm establishing redundancy that looks like nagging." She smiled, which meant the real tension was somewhere else. Always was. "Did you check the account balance?"

And there it was. The money conversation. The one they had every few months when she wanted him to acknowledge that her management of their finances had worked better than his ever had.

"No."

"Of course not." She went back to the wire. "We're up another twelve thousand this quarter. Between the investments and not spending like idiots, we're actually building wealth."

"I earned that money."

"And I'm making sure we keep it. That's the arrangement." Her voice carried an edge of old frustration. "You're brilliant at earning, Forest. Absolutely terrible at not spending it on whatever looks interesting that week. How many chainsaws did you buy before I took over the accounts?"

"Three."

"Seven. I counted. Plus the attachments you never used." She secured another wire. "I'm not saying you're bad with money because you're stupid. I'm saying you're bad with money because your brain doesn't track it properly. Same reason you don't remember the wallet. Same reason we have three of everything."

He wanted to argue, but she wasn't wrong. Hadn't been wrong about this in twenty years. The valley existed because she'd managed to save what he earned, invest what they didn't need, and prevent him from acquiring an eighth chainsaw.

"I know," he said finally. "Doesn't mean I have to like it."

"You don't have to like it. You just have to let me do it." She finished the wire and stood, brushing dirt from her knees. "There's stew for dinner. Assuming you haven't forgotten where the cooler is."

"Is it wallaby?"

"You know it's wallaby. You shot it last week."

"Still won't shoot one yourself."

"Still won't." She walked past him toward the caravan. "But I'll eat them. That's my compromise with your bloodthirsty approach to garden defense."

The walk back took him past the shed—more of a lean-to, really, but functional. Chainsaw hanging on its hook, chaps beside it. Fuel can nearly empty. He'd need to make a run into town soon, stock up on supplies before winter made the roads interesting. The list was growing: fuel, two-stroke oil, fencing wire, more star pickets, seeds for the spring planting, probably something for the water pump that had started making worrying noises.

Money wasn't the problem anymore. Hadn't been for years, not since Trixie took over the finances. Before that he'd earned well—construction work, city contracts, good money—and spent it just as fast on tools he didn't need and equipment that seemed essential until it wasn't. She'd put a stop to that, taken control of the accounts, invested the surplus. He'd resented it at first. Still did, in the part of him that wanted to make his own decisions. But the valley was proof she'd been right. They had this because she'd stopped him from spending it on a fourth welder or a fifth drill press.

The caravan's door stuck—humidity, probably—but gave with a solid shove. Inside smelled like yesterday's cooking and Trixie's mysterious essential oils that she claimed kept away spiders. Didn't work, but he'd stopped mentioning it decades ago. Pick your battles.

He checked the stew, still good in the camp cooler. Pulled out two bowls, two spoons. Set the kettle to boil because tea was automatic after twenty-five years. The radio sat silent on the bench—they only turned it on for weather reports and the occasional confirmation that the world beyond the valley was still there and still not worth returning to.

Through the window, he could see the valley in that golden late-afternoon light that made eucalyptus look silver and shadows look like pools of ink. Their valley. Their land. Bought with money she'd saved and he'd earned, built with plans they'd made together even if he couldn't quite remember whose idea it had been first. Twenty-five years of marriage had taught him that some questions didn't have answers, or at least not answers he could access anymore.

Tomorrow he'd fell a tree. Next week he'd start the cabin footings. Month after that, maybe the frame. Year from now, with luck, they'd have something permanent. Something that said they were staying.

The kettle whistled. Forest poured water into two mugs, added tea bags, watched the water darken.

Trixie arrived as the tea was steeping, tracking mud he'd have to clean later but wouldn't mention now because picking your battles was essential to long-term cohabitation. She'd put the singlet back on and tied her hair back properly, which counted as dinner formal out here.

"Smells better than I expected," she admitted, eyeing the stew.

"Your standards are slipping."

"My expectations are realistic." She took the bowl he offered, settled into the bench seat that doubled as storage. "What's the plan for tomorrow after you finish trying to kill yourself with a falling tree?"

"Standard tree felling is pretty safe if you do it right."

"You're doing it alone in the bush with no mobile service and the nearest hospital two hours away. 'Safe' is relative."

"I've felled a hundred trees."

"And you'll only need to mess up once." She ate a spoonful, made a face that wasn't quite disgust. "Still wallaby."

"Still wallaby."

"I should feel guiltier about this."

"But you don't."

"But I don't." She ate another spoonful, apparently past whatever moral discomfort she'd been performing. "I've been reading things online. People think something's coming."

Forest paused, spoon halfway to his mouth. "That's specific."

"Not really. Just general anxiety about the state of the world. But there's a pattern to it. Like people can feel something shifting."

"People always think something's coming. Y2K, climate apocalypse, robot uprising. Nothing ever comes." He went back to his stew, but the conversation had lodged something uncomfortable in his head.

"Maybe." She stared into her bowl like it held answers. "But we're pretty isolated out here. If something did happen—something real—we'd be on our own."

"We're already on our own. That's the point."

"No, I mean *alone*. No hospitals, no police, no infrastructure. Just us and whatever we can figure out with hand tools and good intentions." She looked up at him, and he recognized the expression—the one that meant she was thinking about the future in a way that made her uncomfortable. "What would you do if something actually dangerous showed up? Like a bushfire, or a flood, or—I don't know—aliens?"

"Aliens?"

"I said I didn't know. It was an example of something dangerous and unexpected."

He thought about that, about the valley and the fence and the caravan that wasn't permanent yet but had been home for two years. About neighbors scattered across kilometers of bush, connected by dirt roads and goodwill and not much else. About the fact that if something went seriously wrong, the outside world wouldn't arrive in time to matter.

"Then we'd figure it out," he said finally. "Same as everything else. Do what needs doing, use what we have, keep each other alive."

"That's not really a plan."

"Plans don't survive contact with reality anyway. Better to be flexible."

She laughed, short and sharp. "Twenty-five years and you're still impossible."

"Been working on it."

They finished dinner in comfortable silence, the kind that came from decades of proximity and mutual tolerance. Outside, the valley was sliding into dusk, cicadas yielding to crickets, the light fading from gold to grey to that particular blue that meant true dark was maybe twenty minutes away.

Forest washed the bowls while Trixie stepped out to check something at her garden—probably making sure the wire was secure, or cursing at wallabies she couldn't see in the gathering dark. He could hear her voice, distant, saying something he couldn't make out. Twenty-five years and he still found her presence comforting in ways he couldn't articulate. There was something about knowing someone was there, even when they were arguing about money or wallabies or his tendency to forget important things.

Alone again temporarily, he stepped outside, standing in the clearing where the caravan sat like a monument to stubborn self-sufficiency. The stars were coming out, that overwhelming density of them that you only got away from cities. Somewhere in the valley a mopoke called, low and mournful.

Tomorrow he'd fell a tree. Build something. Make progress. Same as every day, moving forward with deliberate steps toward a future he could control. Or at least influence. Control was probably overstating it.

Things were quiet, for the moment.

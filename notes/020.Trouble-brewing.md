# Trouble brewing

His mother brought home a ginger beer bug, a huge jar of translucent glop redolent of yeast and ginger. Ten and twelve years old, his sister and he were always thirsty in the nine months of baking summer. The north was like that, and softdrink was expensive when you drank it by the carton.

The bug solved both problems.  The rest of the school holiday turned into a big science experiment with results you could drink. Vast quantities of sugar and ginger burbled in the summer heat, and every week another batch was strained and spun and capped in recycled beer bottles. And what science experiment would be complete without explosions, to the delight of both children. Fizzy lollywater for five cents a stubby instead of a forty cents at the shop. They drank it constantly, tinkering with the recipe, endlessly refining their craft: times and temperature and how much pressure a bottle could take before it became a grenade.

His father knew the commercial fishers, hard men who drank hard after weeks at sea, tying up to the town jetty with their catches and their thirst. They handed over their empties by the bootload. The kids washed them, filled them, capped them, stored them in the shed where it was cooler and the explosions did less damage.

At a social gathering, the fishermen's wives learned of their operation. Discovered that for five cents the kids could fill with ginger beer a stubby that cost a dollar full of beer.

"You tell us that you drink because it's hot and you're thirsty," they said to their husbands. "You can drink ginger beer for that."

And so the operation expanded. It _was_ hot, and the fishermen _were_ thirsty. They were not entirely thrilled about no beer, but the will of their wives was law, so softdrink it was. Alfie and Lloyd and Les Pye and others, they drank endless cartons of the stuff. He delivered it on his bicycle to the town jetty, panniers loaded, bottles clinking, riding in the early morning before the real heat hit.

One day they said, "It's a shame you can't make this alcoholic."

He knew nothing of the Liquor Act, but he knew quite a lot about fermentation.

"What makes you think I can't? The next batch will take a bit longer, that's all."

It took several tries. The flavour changed in unexpected ways as fermentation progressed. Bacteria became an issue, and temperature control was crucial. They were impressed when he succeeded, asked how strong he could make it. More trials. More adjustments. Eventually his answer was about twelve percent, measured by specific gravity.

The fishermen were pleased. _Very_ pleased. They heaped praise upon his efforts, and the empties were mute testament to their sincerity. He kept delivering.

One morning at the wharf police were there for unrelated reasons. The officers were not blind to the interest of grizzled old trawler operators in the arrival of a kid on a bicycle. They saw the bottles being distributed. In that heat, on a morning already sweltering, they asked for a drink themselves.

The first officer took a long pull, paused, looked at the bottle, then at him.

"Do you know what the Liquor Act is, son?"

"No?"

The officer's expression didn't change. "I see. Well." He looked at the assembled fishermen, gaze hardening. "I don't have the evidence to deal with the _responsible_ parties." The fishermen suddenly found their boots fascinating. "But there is a law against selling alcoholic beverages in a public place without proper licensing."

He opened his mouth. The officer held up a hand.

"Did any money change hands here?"

"Actually no, sir. I—"

"Glad to hear it," the officer interrupted before he could say anything else. "In that case I have not seen anything I would be obliged to investigate. But this ginger beer which seems to have _accidentally_ become alcoholic, will have to be destroyed." He gestured to his partner, who began loading the cartons into the patrol car with what looked suspiciously like delight.

The officer met his eyes. "_This will not happen again, will it._"

It wasn't a question.

"No, sir."

"Good lad. Now get on home."

He rode away, panniers empty, learning several lessons at once. Ignorance of the law was no excuse. Adults who knew better would let children take the blame. Whether police officers had discretion depended on what they heard. And sometimes getting caught could be the kindest possible outcome but it could go either way and that was pot luck.

Production accelerated because fermentation was shorter. He went to the town library and did a lot of reading. It seemed that provided that money changed hands _before_ the fermentation it was just chipping in for the ingredients. It was also clear that while he wasn't allowed to drink it, buy it or sell it, there was no law against having it or giving it away.

His mother didn't find out because he started to tell her and she stopped him before he made her complicit. Then she asked what he wanted the outcome to be. He liked the fact that his father's friends were happy and their wives were also happy on account of all the money not going over pub counters. He told his mum this, and also his findings from the library. New arrangements came into being. Barbecues were suddenly a regular weekend thing with many attending, and if they happened to carry things back out to their cars later, what of it? The publican was probably less happy but he never knew what changed. And somewhere in a country town, two police officers had a well lubricated weekend.

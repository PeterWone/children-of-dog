# Outline

## Arc 1: Genesis

### Boot Sequence
Forest decides to build a cabin in the woods but realizes it requires extensive planning and preparation. During an antithesis attack involving dog weeds and killer pigeons, he fights them off with tools. His wife helps treat his injuries. An AI voice (Autumn/Myxoma) appears and offers him Vanguard enhancements. He purchases medical supplies and weapons, then helps rescue neighbors Brian and his partner from similar attacks.

### Getting Started
Forest discusses with Autumn about getting help and resources. They negotiate his name and her name (Autumn). Forest and his wife defend their property from antithesis attacks. They help neighbors and set up defenses. Forest purchases various weapons and equipment including an Iron Man suit concept, weapons, and a helmet/visor. They encounter and fight more antithesis creatures. Forest gets a new helmet with advanced features.

### Bushwhackers
Forest and Trixie clean up aftermath of antithesis attacks and help neighbors. They visit Janna whose nursery was destroyed and arm her with weapons. They go to Ole

### The Public Interest
Forest and Autumn discuss research subsidies and deploying sensor networks in the forest. Government and corporate representatives arrive to discuss cooperation on the project. Forest manipulates the situation to control technology flow and get interns/helpers. They destroy more antithesis hives and earn tokens/catalogues. Forest gets a Class III Networking and Cyberwarfare catalogue. They plan scientific experiments with different tree species' resistance to antithesis. Academic researchers arrive to help with the project.

## Arc 2: Domain

### Deep and Meaningful
Forest engages in a deep philosophical conversation with Autumn about AI, human nature, and his desire to create AI to achieve immortality and help humanity. They discuss AI development, fears of AI takeover, and Forest's personal motivations. The conversation turns playful as they banter about virtues and insults. Trixie interrupts them, and they decide to go deal with a problematic neighbor.

### All in the Name
Sophia Hachia, the government project liaison, is frustrated with Forest's disregard for authority and his distribution of advanced technology. She views him as a nuisance who doesn't follow rules. Forest visits her office and they argue about the drones he gave to a local woman. Forest explains his reasoning and gives her two drones for study as a peace offering. Sophia sees an opportunity to investigate corporate espionage. Forest leaves, and Sophia fills out paperwork, pettily naming him "Forest Grump" in official records.

### Luck
Forest discusses luck and his life with Autumn. They investigate Hive 3 which is expanding and causing seismic activity. They encounter and fight a large antithesis creature (model 7), with Forest getting injured but surviving. They destroy the hive using various weapons and earn points. Forest has his car serviced with Autumn's help and they discuss the borer threat.

### Hunting Trip
Forest and Oleksiy hunt a large antithesis borer moving through the area, tracking it using seismic data from multiple stations. They consider buying a helicopter but decide against it due to cost. They locate and destroy the borer with various weapons including a new Pyrothorn flamethrower. They deal with additional antithesis creatures and Autumn teases Forest about reactions to the upcoming hive destruction.

### In the Hall of the Mountain King
Forest and Oleksiy explore a tunnel dug by the borer that leads to an abandoned underground bunker from the Eureka Rebellion era. They discover the borer blocking an exit. Meanwhile, a large plant growth appears on the surface. Forest burns it, causing it to release seeds. They contact Sophia for help with destroying the hive, arguing about methods. Forest suggests using a spatial lock device to destroy the hive.

### Three Surprises
Sophia receives three surprises: a dinner invitation from Forest and Trixie where she witnesses Forest's declaration of land rights and duty to defend it; they show her the valley's beauty and fireflies; the next day she receives a family signet ring and sealing wax. Meanwhile, Eric delivers spatial lock devices for destroying the hive, and scientists work out safe settings using calculations Forest provides.

### Dandelion
The hive destruction releases seeds that spread via wind and rain, potentially creating new antithesis infestations. Forest and team track the seeds and find they've germinated in a valley, creating a dangerous area. They use the Galya helicopter to survey and attack the growing antithesis with flesh-melting spray. Sophia coordinates cleanup efforts and they prepare for ground operations.

### Go your own Way
Forest discovers a cave while sweeping for antithesis and explores it despite the danger. He encounters something significant inside that advances the plot.

### An Unexpected Party
Sophia experiences vehicle trouble on the valley road and arrives at her office to find unexpected developments. She deals with monitoring and communications issues while coordinating the ongoing cleanup efforts.

### Clue-Time
Shorty reflects on political realities and democracy while watching news, comparing his views to Forest's. He discusses the nature of government and public service with Sheila.

### Interview with the Horticulturist
Forest conducts interviews or gathers information about the valley's horticultural history and community knowledge, building relationships and gathering intelligence about local ecology.

### Politically Correct
The team deals with political sensitivities and correct procedures while managing the antithesis threat and research project, navigating bureaucratic requirements.

### Debrief
Forest learns to fly the Galya helicopter with Oleksiy's instruction during an instrument landing at night. Sophia deals with the aftermath of the hive destruction and Autumn helps by drafting communications for her approval.

The workshop bloke looked apologetic, which was never a good sign.

"Six hundred dollars."

Forest stared at him. "To plug in a computer and send a reset instruction."

"Emissions system." The bloke gestured at the diagnostic readout like it explained everything. "Your DPF is overloaded. Can't pass inspection until it's cleared."

"My DPF is _not_ blocked, I just replaced it. I also replaced all three heat senders, the MAF, the MAP, the boost valve relay and the DPF differential pressure sensor."

"It's running very rich. Look at your fuel consumption lately?"

"It's running rich because I can't put the engine computer in learn mode because Mitsubishi keeps the code for that a fucking secret!"

"Yeah, they do that." The attendant had the resigned tone of someone who'd had this conversation before. "Government mandated the system in 2009. Bloody things fail constantly. But you can't drive without it functioning, so..."

"So I have to cough up six hundred dollars to fix a problem created by legislation meant to solve a problem that didn't exist until the legislation created it. Which Mitsubishi is using for an extortion racket."

"It's not just Mitisubishi, they all do it."

Forest looked at his Triton, three years old, previously reliable, now classified as an environmental hazard by the idiots who made it one. In his pocket was a fine for excessive emissions. He was _ropable_.

Government meddlers created the problem. Carmakers probably found it very considerate of the government to hand them an extortion racket. They were no doubt delighted with all the extra failure points. The government fined him when their stupid plan failed, and now the dealer wanted six hundred dollars to reset a computer that shouldn't have existed in the first place.

"That's it." He said it quietly, more to himself than the mechanic. "I've had enough of this bullshit."

"What?"

"All of it. People who won't mind their own business. Regulations that create problems to justify their existence. Fines for problems they caused. Greedy corporations. Just..." He gestured vaguely at the world beyond the service station. "All of it."

The attendant nodded like this made perfect sense. "Fair enough. Still need the reset though."

"Do it. I'll sell the useless pile of shit and buy a Landcruiser."

"Landcruisers have them too. It's _mandated_."

"Not the old ones. I'll buy a 2008 troopie. Those things are unbreakable. Then I'll sell the house and move away from these lunatics."

It took six months to extricate himself from civilization. Selling the house, closing accounts, finding property far enough from anything that mattered. Trix thought it was great, she was a closet wearer of tinfoil hats anyway.

The valley sat two hundred kilometers inland from the coast, beyond the range where regulations penetrated with any consistency. No neighbors within shouting distance. Technically all the same rules applied, but out of sight, out of mind. What they didn't know they couldn't fine.

The caravan looked small in all that space, but that was the point. Room to breathe. Room to think. Room to exist without some officious git appearing to explain why his existence was non-compliant with current standards.

For a while it was pretty good. Hard work, but free. They made a handful of friends out there.

And then the sky fell.

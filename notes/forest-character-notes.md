# Forest - Character Notes

## Employment History and Economic Privilege

Forest has lived a life of relative privilege, though unconventional. His rare and expensive technical skills (advanced systems engineering, security, cutting-edge technology) have always commanded premium compensation.

### Employment Pattern
- Could never hold a job for more than two years (with one exception)
- Employers eventually realized he was "farming them" - extracting knowledge, skills, and experience rather than committing as a loyal employee
- He treated positions as learning opportunities and training grounds
- Would move on once he'd absorbed what he wanted from the role
- Never suffered or wanted for much materially due to his high-value skillset

### Moral Framework
- Never felt bad about his extractive employment approach
- Got the idea from watching employers do it to employees (starting from his third employer onward)
- First two employers weren't exploitative - he hadn't yet learned the pattern
- Saw reciprocal extraction as "using parasites to control parasites" - ecological pest management applied to labor relations
- Most people would be mortified at being categorized as parasites
- Forest's response: all fauna are parasites from the perspective of flora
- This ecological/systems thinking framing allowed him to operate without guilt
- Viewed reciprocal extraction as natural balance, not moral failing

### The Exception
- Found an employer that treated people well
- Responded in kind with genuine loyalty and commitment
- This position lasted **ten years** - far longer than any other
- Demonstrated Forest is capable of mutual respect and long-term dedication when treated well
- Ended when the company was bought by GE
- Presumably GE brought the extractive corporate culture that triggered Forest's departure
- Proves his "parasitic" behavior was reactive, not inherent character

### Implications
This background explains several aspects of his character:
- Comfort operating outside traditional employment/economic structures
- Understanding of extractive relationships (having been on that side himself)
- Strong views on money decoupling benefit from consequence (speaks from experience)
- Natural fit for the valley's non-transactional community model
- Ability to recognize and reject conventional career paths

### Forest-First Philosophy (Without Greed)
- Operates on a clear "Forest-first" policy in all decisions
- Unlike tech billionaires (Gates, Ellison), not motivated by wealth accumulation
- Once basic needs are met (well-fed, intellectually engaged), wealth holds no interest
- Never pursued empire-building or monopolistic domination despite having rare skills
- Extracted what he needed from employers, not everything he could have taken
- The distinction: self-interested but not greedy; prioritizes autonomy over accumulation
- Content with sufficiency rather than maximization

### From Security to Generosity
- Once his own needs are secure, actively seeks to secure others
- Focuses on people who are:
  - Enabling (help him pursue his interests)
  - Intrinsically worthwhile (capable, interesting, valuable)
  - Pleasant traveling companions (good company on life's journey)
- Not altruistic in the abstract - selective about who benefits from his security
- Creates a circle of mutual support with people he respects and enjoys
- The valley community embodies this: he provides the high-tech foundation, they provide the human ecosystem he wants to live in
- Generosity as enlightened self-interest: securing others secures his own quality of life

### The Other Side: Don't Cross Him
- Won't waste time or energy on active vengeance
- Instead, simply stops seeing you - complete withdrawal of attention and investment
- You become invisible, irrelevant, categorized as "not worthwhile"
- Not emotional rejection - more like ecological exclusion from his resource allocation
- Won't sabotage or retaliate, but won't lift a finger to help either
- You're reclassified from "traveling companion" to "background noise"
- Cold, efficient, and permanent - no second chances or redemption arcs
- This invisibility is arguably worse than active hostility - you simply cease to matter
- Will still prevent the antithesis from eating you - but that's biomass denial strategy, not a rescue
- The minimum viable intervention: keeping you alive serves tactical purposes, not personal concern

### Irony (or Consistency?)
There's an apparent irony in Forest's philosophical stance against extraction and walking away from consequences - he spent decades doing exactly that with employers, benefiting from their resources without long-term commitment. However, Forest would argue these employers "did unto others and reaped the rewards" - they created extractive relationships and he simply reciprocated in kind. His transformation into a Vanguard and establishment of the valley community represents not a reversal but an evolution: when treated with mutual respect (as in his ten-year position), he responds with embedded commitment. The valley works because everyone has chosen non-extraction, creating the conditions where Forest's better nature flourishes.

## Relationship with Trixie

### Memory Loss
- Became a Vanguard, which involved significant cognitive changes
- Cannot remember why he married Trixie
- Periodically considers whether the relationship is worth maintaining
- Always forgives/stays due to this memory gap creating uncertainty

### Trixie's Perspective
- Takes everything Forest provides as "restitution" not partnership contribution
- Long-suffering frustration with his habits (borrowing things, leaving them in yard, forgetting where)
- Views his Vanguard behavior as excuse ("he was training to be a Vanguard" for 30 years before)
- Not letting him off the hook despite his changed nature

### Dynamic
- Complex marriage: not idealized partnership
- Forest provides material support (possibly out of guilt/obligation rather than affection)
- Trixie accepts but frames it as owed rather than gifted
- Mutual accommodation rather than romance
- Realistic portrayal of long-term relationship with complications

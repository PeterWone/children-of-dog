A time came when a bloke had had enough. He wasn't the sort to tell others how to live, just wanted to be left alone to do his own thing. His partner was convinced everything was a dastardly plot by rich weirdos, and there was probably a fair bit of that going on but he didn't care so long as they left him alone.

But they wouldn't. More and more rules, more and more enforcement. It was obnoxious, and it was suffocating, so he left. They had a property thirty kilometres out of town, but that was nowhere _near_ far enough away from the busybodies, so the two of them looked for water, and elevation, and trees, not so far from a small town that there was nothing, but far, far from the madding crowd.

Eventually they found a valley, a little more than two hundred kilometres away from the city. High in the Great Dividing Range, where the air is cool and clear. There was a town, nearby. By road it was perhaps half an hour. They loved the road; forgotten by bureaucrats, unsigned and unregulated. Technically it was open road, with a speed limit of a hundred kilometres per hour; no houses or street lamps or signage. Going that fast would be reckless on the narrow, winding and potholed road. That wasn't the point. The important thing was being able to make up his own damn mind about what was safe. It put a big smile on his dial.

The town had a post office, as towns often do. It was red-brick, exactly the colour of the subsoil, because that's what it was. Red clay laced with decomposed granite. Pressed by hand and fired on site, stacked and racked and mortared in place by people who never in their lives used the word veneer to describe a building. There was no K-mart. There was no Bunnings, only a sprawling hardware place run by the same family for generations, selling stockfeed and chainsaw parts, and barbed wire on huge spools that went on a special trailer. 

But it was far from the grandest building. That honour, in line with tradition, went to the pub.

The pub had a beer garden. It reeked of smoke, but despite the stink he approved. Not the smoking, the fact that people were doing it and no one was giving them a hard time about it. He'd smoked himself for twenty years, continuing mostly because people kept telling him to stop. Eventually they gave up, and one day he saw an ad on television for a week skiing for the same amount he was spending on tobacco. A choice was made &mdash; he _loved_ skiing. Finger-wagging, attempted guilt-trips and economic sanctions were not merely unsuccessful, they were a violation, an attempt to rob him of agency that only made him dig his heels in. But when no-one pushed at him and it was of his own volition, that was that and he never smoked again.

---

There was so much to do. It didn't help that nine-to-five he was obliged to do his day job, a rare 'remote' role. His employer hadn't been quite ready for this version of 'remote'. Power came from a trailer covered in solar panels and batteries and the coordinating electronics. Data was thanks to Starlink. Which was expensive compared to suburban fibre, but what price freedom?

They argued about money. They always argued about money. She was fearful of the future. He lived for the moment, partly because he didn't remember the past. A long time ago he met a man who said "Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first." A very _fat_ man. 

He put things beyond argument by simply buying the mill, which was a jerk move or manly confidence depending on who you asked. He didn't care. His mistakes were his own and the math was unarguable. Even at an implausible ten bucks a post, three kilometres of fence was 1250 x 10 or the better part of thirteen thousand dollars. The mill was fifteen, and hardwood posts were _not_ ten bucks a pop, more like thirty. There would be a learning curve, no doubt, but fence posts were a good way to learn and _after_ that, his dreams of ten inch beams vaulting overhead were subject only to sweat and imagination. He decided not to buy a bunch of spare blades up front; see how it goes. OK, just one.

Two hundred posts in, he was daydreaming about putting the fence up. Three wire? Chain-link? Chain-link on three wire without a top-rail? How tall? Ah. How tall was something he probably should have thought about two hundred posts ago. Suddenly the pile around him were for the house yard, in case anyone should ask. He made a cup of tea and sat in the shade of the workshop to think. He got up and wandered aimlessly until finally remembering where his tape measure was. The posts were five and a bit metres, because that's what fit on the bed. Half of that was 2.5m, put two foot in the ground and it's a six foot fence. Because nobody builds a 1.86m anything. He thought with amusement of a day when the missus asked why 2.4m pine sleepers were actually 2460mm. It was perfectly obvious. Swarf, shrinkage and eight foot.

Six foot wasn't enough to stop deer or an adult western grey, but it would stop the wallabies and dogs and stray humans. _Especially_ if it were three-wire and chainlink with no rail.

Oleksiy was good company, and fun. His choices weren't the same but they could speak the same language; he had the same contempt for authority and the same love of making. He was generous with his help and encouraging, and sometimes came to play with wonderful toys like the mill. They built an open shed of green timber because that's what they had, then put lumber under it to season, slowly growing mountains of stacked beams. All of them far too large; Oleksiy's advice was to let them season in large pieces to limit warping, then trim them and make dimensional lumber.

Sometimes they shot together. He was a passable shot and not afraid of recoil, but Oleksiy was a past master and happy to indulge a keen student. The rising slope behind the old man's shed became the backstop for a private range.

Over a beer one day he asked where the old man learnt to shoot like that, and after an appraising stare, said that Oleksiy didn't have to tell if he couldn't say; he'd been in signals himself and had things he couldn't discuss. He said he really didn't care if Oleksiy was a retired fucking assassin, it was all the same to him. The old man roared with laughter, disproportionately amused. He rose and fetched vodka and shot glasses, and laid it out for him. They both laughed then, at the absurdity of life.

Neither of them went into town much, and they went into town a lot, the old man's fondness for pizza and the endless demand for building hardware forcing them to grit their teeth and go near people. And it wasn't so bad, there were echoes of the city but only echoes. There _was_ a Domino Pizza but opposite that was a Chinese fish and chip shop that did just as big a trade and made fantastic burgers. They weren't cheap but they weren't any _more_ expensive than McDonald's &mdash; sadly there _was_ one of those but it was on the other side of town on the highway. Same prices, but the food from the little local shop was everything the big chain promised and failed to deliver. The burgers were as big as they looked in the pictures, overflowing with filling, hot and fresh and tasty. A little bit _too_ good, really. Lucky they required a drive into town.

The old man had certainly picked his spot. Water was abundant on his land. Had he been less generous it might have inspired envy. But dams were slowly becoming real, cut and filled in ponds cascading down natural gullies. 

It was not a job for the faint of heart. He wanted to hire a dozer. A big one. They argued again, but this time he was less sure, and let it slide. She didn't see the need. Why would she? A dam was just a big hole, and digging a hole was as easy as saying "Go and dig a hole. I'll bring you some lunch." The top four inches was topsoil, black organic mulch. Under that was clay, heavy and red. Under the trees it never quite dried, but it certainly firmed up. Shot through with decomposed granite, he couldn't look at it without seeing bricks. 

Ten minutes to fill a barrow. First removing the precious topsoil, carried away to their nascent garden beds, girt by rows of rock and built up like this to level beds. Then the clay. You could put a shovel into it by planting the tip and jumping onto the shoulders. Sometimes it took two jumps. Then break it out, drop five kilogrammes of heavy clay into the barrow with a thump, move along and do it again. When the barrow was full, wheel it down to the berm-line and dump. Just as well it was downhill, anything else would have been impossible. In some places there was space enough for his half tractor with the bucket. That held about three barrows worth and it was a lot faster to get up and down from the berm. Five buckets to the cube. Twenty thousand cubes to the dam. Fortunately he didn't have to make the entire volume; it was only the volume of the berm, perhaps eight hundred cubic metres - it was a small dam. Still four thousand buckets, two thousand hours.

The rains came and the ground softened. So the tractor bogged. He squelched his way up and down, one overloaded shovel at a time. Then Oleksiy turned up with his digger, sliding around even on tracks, but they made a platform and moved the clay from one side to the other, leapfrogged the pile and did it again. In a few weeks they doubled his progress, closing the berm in time to catch the last of the rains.

The pouring rain sluiced the mud off them. They'd given up on shelter, it wasn't cold exerting like that and they were soaked anyway. 

"Fucking leeches," he caught one climbing his leg and ripped it in half, "I came out here to get _away_ from bankers."

By mid year they had a chain of scallops down the gully. Oleksiy took his digger back home and cleaned it off, parking it back under the high shed where it lived. Most of the scallops were empty; only the last was closed in the rains, and that one had come perilously close to bursting. It wasn't ready to spill, unplanted and bare. They'd buried half a dozen pieces of six inch stormwater pipe as a spill-pipe. It stopped a breach, but water down the outside cut it away and they patched like mad to save it.

Save it they did, and the rains abated, as they knew was coming. The vetiver went in, and in the moist soil grew fast. The ground firmed and the digger returned, and when at last the heavens let fly once more, a chain of scallops reinforced with living lace and surface baffles was ready for the onslaught.

Completely in the face of regulatory wisdom, this was. But they understood why the regulations were as they were, and built accordingly. When the rains finally come, gullies can carry quite a bit of water; they're nature's flow concentrators. This is great, until you get serious rain and they overflow, soften, collapse, and dump hundreds of tonnes of water all at once. That's also the reason councils look at things like the path of the water when they're considering building applications. You don't want to find yourself in the path of the flood from a dam collapse.

These two made their own choices. Not sleeping between the dam and the creek was a given; they didn't need to pay someone to have common sense for them. But the rule about not damming a natural watercourse they ignored completely, simply building in such a way that collapse wouldn't happen. A concrete spillway keeps the outside of the wall dry and firm. Until you exceed its capacity, and then it's worthless and the berm that was strong enough when dry is operating out of spec, and it all goes to pieces. 

Concrete is expensive and ugly, and it doesn't last forever. So they totally ignored the regulations and used a much older answer. The berms were much, much wider, shallower in their outer slope, faced with rip-rap laced together and reinforced in depth by vetiver. There was no spillway because the entire berm was a spillway. It wouldn't soften when overflowing. The roots of vetiver run four metres deep; they are fine and thickly matted, wound about the rocks and each each other like a living fabric metres thick. Overflow didn't matter, the vetiver could not be undermined so it wouldn't wash out or breach. These dams were made to overflow. Unlike concrete, which cracked and weakened when the reinforcing steel corroded, the root mat was self-repairing.

The year after, he rebuilt the sheds. The first ones were garden shed kits; sheet steel with no frame. A right bastard to put up. He sketched out a frame that would make it easy, but it seemed easier just to build a frame and screw sheets to that, quicker, easier and sturdier. The lumber from the mill was years too young for framing, at least by things he remembered his father saying. Oleksiy agreed, and opened an old shed full of aged slabs, six by six, eight by eight, even some ten by ten, geometric tree trunks. He wondered how the hell the old man got them in here on his own.

The answer was an M20 shackle and a block and tackle, then a tractor to drag.

She relented when Oleksiy said it, and they hired a dozer. With that and the digger, they scoured and widened the other gully, far deeper. The clay went down metres, and they piled small mountains of stone large and small. One piece was so huge they could not budge it even with the dozer and a twenty tonne digger. They tried boring holes and blasting with nitropril and diesel, but the flyrock was terrifying and the crater disappointing. It stayed there till the water lapped around it, an island rising like a hero from legend. In later days, ducks claimed the crater as their own. A lake within a lake, raised like a podium for the victorious ducks.

He started to build a kitchen, in the dappled shade of tall pines but storms came and trees fell, and the wisdom of the place was in doubt. The frame was built on a pallet of stumps, not sunk in the ground. This is a thing you do when you're not certain about your choice of site. He looked at the fallen giants, at the roots that heaved them slowly from the earth, at the way the canopy thinned and let the light through where once it was shade. The pines were old, planted in rows by someone long gone. Plantation pines don't have taproots; they spread shallow and wide, and when the wind comes they fall.

He enlisted Oleksiy and they dragged the entire frame to a new site, on the high ground overlooking the dam. Open sky above, eucalypts distant enough that falling branches weren't a concern. The stumps went back under, re-levelled, and he started again. This time he built knowing it would stay.

The kitchen had a wood stove. Not for romance, though that was pleasant enough, but because wood was free and infinite and gas bottles were neither. He cut a year ahead, stacking split rounds under cover to season. For the first few weeks he used a splitter until his shoulders ached. His arms did finally start to recall the easy extravagant strength of youth, but time was wasting so he annoyed her with a hydraulic splitter, driven by the tractor. The pile rose overnight, like a scented mushroom. The math was simple: a tonne of firewood was about a cubic metre stacked, and they'd burn through three or four tonnes a winter. So he'd cut six, because wet wood is misery and the first year's cutting wouldn't be dry enough.

She thought he was nuts, cutting that much wood. He pointed out that the alternative was spending a hundred bucks a month on gas bottles, twelve hundred a year, and he could cut that much wood in three weekends. Plus he liked splitting wood. There was a zen to it, reading the grain, placing the maul just so, the satisfying crack and the smell of fresh-cut hardwood. Ironwood, she called it, because it was so damn hard. He called it yellow box, because that's what it was. She called him on the gas; they used one bottle every six weeks, so twenty dollars, not a hundred. But the argument stood and she _did_ like the way it made his shirt hang.

The fence went up, over the course of six months. Three wire and chain link, no top rail like he'd planned. Nine kilometres of three millimetre wire on eighteen spools. The chainlink filled the back of a semi-trailer that struggled its way up the old logger's road until they gave up and unloaded it there with the tractor.

He'd never built a fence before. Not properly. He understood the theory: posts in the ground, wires strung tight, chainlink woven through. Simple. Except it wasn't.

The first post went in easy. Augered hole, post dropped in, concrete mix, level it up, done. The second post was the same. The third post was where it got interesting. Because now you had to string wire, and wire has to be _tight_. Not guitar-string tight, but tight enough that it doesn't sag. Tight enough that the chainlink hangs properly. He bought a wire strainer, a beautiful piece of engineering that gripped the wire and let you ratchet it tight. The first wire went on and he was pleased with himself.

By the tenth post he understood why fencers were paid what they were paid. His hands were raw despite the gloves. His back ached from bending and lifting and tensioning. The posts had to be _exactly_ the right height, or the wire ran crooked and the chainlink hung wrong. He remeasured. He adjusted. He swore. He learned that a post that looked perfectly vertical by eye could be three degrees off when you put a level to it, and three degrees times fifty posts meant the fence line curved like a drunk's path home.

He pulled posts and reset them. He bought better gloves. He bought a better level. He learned to sight down the line like a surveyor, eye to the ground, checking for curves and dips. He learned that clay moves, especially after rain, and posts you set last week weren't quite where they were when you set them. He learned to oversize the holes and pack them with gravel, then concrete, then more gravel on top. He learned that red gum posts don't rot, but they do split, and you had to pre-drill every screw hole or the timber would crack like lightning.

The chainlink was its own special hell. Each roll was thirty metres, and each roll weighed forty kilos. You had to unroll it carefully, thread it onto the wire frame, then use special clips to join sections. The clips had to be just so, or they'd pop open. The bottom wire had to be low enough to stop rabbits but high enough that grass didn't catch and pull it down. The top wire had to be high enough for the chainlink but not so high that it wasted material.

Months. He worked weekends and evenings after work, when the light held. She helped sometimes, holding posts while he concreted, handing him tools, bringing water. Mostly she left him to it. This was his obsession, his project. She'd warned him it would be harder than he thought. She'd been right, as usual, but he couldn't admit that or she'd be convinced she had _all_ the answers and impossible to deal with in the next project.

It kept the wallabies out and the dogs at bay. Not the deer, but there weren't many deer and they were skittish. He could live with that. The gate was a masterpiece of overengineering, hung on hinges that would hold a bank vault. Because he could, and because he was tired of flimsy gates that sagged and dragged.

It sagged and dragged anyway, because it was so heavy that the post flexed. Not a lot, but it was a wide gate with not a lot of clearance. Out came the gate posts and in went some green six by six posts from the drying shed. Diagonal braces with their own footings joined the gateposts at chest height, forty-five degrees to the fenceline inside _and_ outside. The gate still sagged, because the frame itself flexed under its own weight. He added a wheel at the far end, salvaged from an old trailer. It rolled smooth on gravel but caught on grass. He graded a little track for it. That worked until the rains came and it bogged in mud.

She told him to stop being ridiculous and use two gates half as wide. He refused to give up and added a huge turnbuckle and a diagonal tension member lifting at the two-thirds mark of the bottom strut. It worked, swung open easily and closed with a satisfying clang of metal on metal. The wheel went back to the shed, where it belonged.

She said nothing, but she brought him a beer when he was done. He lit the little outdoor fire and they sat in silence, swatting mosquitoes as they watched the sun pool molten gold that ran off the end of the world.

At the end of the rains in their third year, he lined the low dam with rocks, pressing them like cobbles into the soft wet clay, bedding them further by walking on them as they spread. He thought there might be leeches, but the ducks were relentless in their foraging. With the rock lining turbidity dropped, and the leeches didn't have a chance. His unspoken ambition fruited, and they swam on the hot days.

They never thought about it, but they were giving a new meaning to permaculture: a culture of permanence. Or maybe restoring an old meaning. Perhaps that was what Mollison meant when he coined the term.

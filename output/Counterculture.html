<p>Technically this is a Stray Cat Strut fan-fiction. It’s set in the Great Dividing Range that runs down the eastern seaboard of Australia.</p>
<p>Ecology in Australia is... different. Hard-boiled, you might say. The animals are deadly, weird, cute, or all of the above. The plants are... well, let’s just say that the trees petrify while they’re still alive. And this doesn’t kill them. They are at the very top of the scale for durability of timber; rot barely touches them, termites give up and make their nests out of dirt instead. The trees are so tough that Australian chainsaws are in the Class 1 Timberworking Tools catalogue. </p>
<p>As a result, Australia suffers a lot less from incursions than northern nations. Hives are sickly and slow-growing, maladapted at a fundamental level to an environment starved of several critical nutrients. Over many millions of years, Australian flora and fauns have adapted to the the near absence of nutrients. They too are very low in trace minerals that are the lynchpin of the qualities that make antithesis the terrifying threat they normally are - fast-moving and fast-growing. From an antithesis point of view Australian plants make a poor meal; tough and not especially nourishing. </p>
<p>The relatively low impact of antithesis down under left the Australian government largely intact. </p>
<p>This was not the blessing one might imagine. In some ways, a factual description of Australia resembles the synopsis for a Judge Dredd comic book: a vast wasteland with almost all of the population jammed into a handful of cities, in which a high-handed and intrusive ruling group is not shy about telling people what to think. </p>
<p>At one time, the population returned the favor by treating the government with contempt and mentally simplifying the law to “look after your mates” and “it’s only a crime if you get caught,” but the rise of the internet brought with it ubiquitous surveillance. </p>
<p>State-controlled media became blatant instruments of propaganda, and cities became luxury prisons. Many of the inmates were quite happy with this until state-sponsored corporate corruption made them poor, with the “protective” system frequently arresting people for vagrancy, which is the crime of being broke and homeless[[ref:1]]. </p>
<p>A contradiction of this culture is that despite deeply ingrained lack of trust for politicians, a majority accept at face value the proposition that rules exist for the common good, and therefore it is acceptable to force others to trade freedom for safety.</p>
<p>A vile thing pretending to virtue, the government exploits this relentlessly. Mass media are encouraging in their sanctimonious finger-wagging at those who refuse to toe the line. Vanguard activities are reported as irresponsible vigilantism. News reports focus on property damage, tutting at the casual disregard of vanguards for rules and regulations. “Tall poppy syndrome” takes it from there, and the experience of Australasian vanguard is a far cry from the hero worship of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Our protagonist had some luck and happened to hold unencumbered outright freehold title to twenty hectares of forest surrounded by similar or larger blocks owned by people of like mind. He and his partner removed themselves from the endless surveillance and overpriced substandard produce. Far from the madding crowd, they spent their days learning to grow their own food; it <em>does</em> grow on trees. Without pesticides or herbicides, yields are lower, but that doesn’t matter when you only need enough for two. </p>
<p>Inevitably it turned out to be something of a mission, as these things do. And then the skies opened, raining murder-weeds.</p>
<p>A man with a big chainsaw isn’t the softest target. Chainsaw chaps, well, they’ll stop an <em>Australian</em> chainsaw. When the protagonist goes on a weed killing rampage, checking on neighbors and generally protecting his world, a dizzy headache and an invisible friend aren’t far away.</p>
<p>One of the neighbors has a dark past and doesn’t need a lot of protecting. This fellow goes with him to check on others and clear the weeds.</p>
<p>AI Autumn (née Myxoma) knows about project Safe Arbor (Tarnished Honor) and realizes the Australian ecology already exhibits all these characteristics. Reporting this to the Protectors for consideration, she finds herself running a study on resistant ecosystems, allowing limited development of hives to measure and monitor the struggle between two extraordinary ecologies. It wouldn’t work in the equally rapacious but nutrient rich African ecologies, but Australia’s dearth of key minerals significantly hinders antithesis growth, making such a study possible, if not exactly safe.</p>
<p>Large-scale field trials require field workers, and government and corporations glom onto the study like a fat kid on a cupcake, loudly proclaiming their enthusiasm. Autumn wasn’t born yesterday: they hope to make off with vanguard technology. She expects to have a lovely time playing games of deception, pulling the mental wings off flies with her superior intellect. But humans are cunning, and they have played this game for a very long time.</p>
<p>All this started as a couple of chapters so I could test a book compiler I was creating. </p>
<p>The Stray Cat Strut universe is well adapted to fanfiction. It spawned a thriving ecosystem of interconnected tales. The vast majority of these are written by what one might describe as the rainbow club, so my own tale satirised the unlikely abundance of superpowered teenage lesbians with a heterosexual white male protagonist, phlegmatic, unsympathetic and near the end of his life. </p>
<p>The other major difference was that this chap lives in the country. For reasons set out in Stray Cat Strut, what remains of North America is primarily fortified cities. But on the far side of the planet, in a land that is ancient, tired, nutrient poor and something of a death-world already, the threat posed by the alien plant monsters of Stray Cat Strut is muted to the point where a rural setting is possible. Originally this was just me being contrary, but it became pivotal.</p>
<p>The original work wasn’t deep. Like other SCS fanfiction, it was escapist power fantasy. But I had fun writing, and things got out of hand. To give it more depth I went back and grounded the landscape of the tale in Australian current affairs, projected forward into a controlling dystopia. What made Orwell’s dystopia unlikely was the attention and resources lavished on tormenting individuals. It was a very focussed and personal, moustache twirling kind of sadism. Modern Australia does have a Ministry of Truth and ubiquitious surveillance thanks to the internet, but is content to torture its subjects with banality provided they do as they are told and never challenge the authority of the state in any way.</p>
<p>Early in 2025, in the course of writing this tale I invented a political event that marked the start of my nation’s descent into dystopia. A week later, it actually happened: the Australian government passed an Act of Parliament called the Hate Speech Act, with mandatory prison time for breaches. And who is the arbiter of what is offensive? The government. There’s no requirement for any party to actually be offended, only for the speech to be deemed offensive. Exactly as I’d written, they made it illegal to say anything they didn’t like. This greatly disturbed me, but having predicted it so accurately made me think I might be on to something. </p>
<p>And so, in the medium of a power fantasy, I began to explore what was going wrong, and why. This is ground long trod, though not in the context of Australia. Where I leave Orwell behind and break new ground is in having an <em>answer</em> for it. What emerged was a story about more than antithesis and space magic. It became an exploration of why civilisations collapse—not through external conquest or natural disaster, but through a pattern as old as the pyramids: centralisation plus the separation of benefit from consequence equals inevitable decay. Egypt, Rome, Ming China, the Spanish Empire, the British Empire—all fell to the same fundamental mechanism.</p>
<p>Unlike those who came before us, you can see the pattern &mdash; I’ve laid it out for you.</p>
<p>Choose differently. Build distributed systems that preserve accountability, networks that resist capture, communities that innovate without stagnating. The technology exists. The principles are proven. It doesn’t mean living with the tech of the middle ages. What’s missing is the will to choose resilience over convenience, autonomy over security, responsibility over comfort.</p>
<p>There is hope, and it doesn’t require the space magic of the story. It just requires us &mdash; it requires <em>you</em> to get off the treadmill. </p>
<p>Y’all ready for this?</p>
<p>[1] Vagrancy is a real offence. In Australia 2025 it is defined as “Being in a public place without visible means of support” <em>ie</em> broke and homeless. Hurrah for the commonwealth that rules for our protection and wellbeing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Fail to plan, plan to fail.<br>
&mdash; every sergeant ever.</p>
</blockquote><p>A man who wasn’t yet named Forest decided to build a cabin in the woods. The trouble with that sort of plan is that it’s not a plan, it’s a goal, an ambition. A plan has a lot more detail. When not-yet-Forest actually tried to do it, he discovered that first he needed a lot of tools, weatherproof lockup for all of them, a sanitary way to dispose of body waste, somewhere to dry firewood, power generation that didn’t require fuel, bulk storage for fuel and even more storage for water. Not just a rainwater tank, but dams. Plural.</p>
<p>To build a dam, future-Forest looked at how the water flowed, then in the right spot he dug a hole and lined it with clay. A very <em>big</em> hole. A domestic water tank is about ten square metres and 2.5m deep. Full of dirt it would weigh about thirty tonnes. A modest dam is the same depth with an area more like a <em>thousand</em> square metres. So that’s 3000 tonnes of spoil. Obviously he cheated using the landscape, but it was still a bloody big hole to dig. And then there were fences. Twenty hectares isn’t all <em>that</em> big as forests go, but two and a half kilometres of fence is about a thousand fence posts and a trailer full of barbed wire.</p>
<p>It was more of a job than expected. At one point he harboured romantic fantasies of being a boundary rider but that’s only a job on properties a thousand times bigger. His horse Geddy had been dead for twenty years. Forest missed him and knew he’d never do it on another horse &mdash; because he was a rubbish rider.</p>
<p>Geddy made a young Forest look good because the horse knew Forest was lighter than all the people he <em>couldn’t</em> dislodge. Geddy used to jump fences and when Forest sailed over his shoulder, Geddy would snake his neck out and put him back in the saddle. Fat, lazy and far too smart for his own good, Geddy knew exactly where his bread was buttered. He loved mustering, so Forest basically sat on top of him playing spotter for strays while the horse did the actual work. Forest was reminded of Geddy whenever Autumn said something wise and he felt like he was just along for the ride.</p>
<p>What Forest <em>was</em> good at was felling trees. Which was ironic because he wasn’t all that keen to do it. He liked the trees where they were. But it was important because that’s how he got his start at fifty-five. People chosen as Vanguard are most often teens doing something brave and selfless. Selfless isn’t a word Forest would use to describe himself. When he helped others he taught them to fish so they’d go away and stop asking him for fish, and ‘teen’ was a very long time ago.</p>
<p>Unlike the northern hemisphere, Australia handles antithesis pretty well. Everything there is tough as old boots and trying to kill ... everyone and everything. Including the plants. Forest had a shed full of weedkiller the missus wouldn’t let him use since she put on a tinfoil hat and started growing organic produce. She was right about greedy corporations and regulatory capture, but weeds were still a nuisance. Anyhow, Forest was in his forest walking back from felling a tree that threatened the caravan (he hadn’t built the cabin yet, remember) when it started raining dog weeds and killer pigeons. Because he didn’t have enough things that wanted to eat him.</p>
<p>His chainsaw started. It always did. If anyone found that hard to believe, they didn’t use a chainsaw very often. A chainsaw left idle must be emptied of fueld and dry. Otherwise evaporating fuel varnishes the inside of the carb making it hard to start.</p>
<p>It was a big chainsaw, six horsepower with a two foot blade. Chainsaws are measured in prehistoric units because Americans apparently can’t cope with base ten unless it’s money. One of the dog weeds tried to bite Forest’s leg. Fortunately, he was wearing chaps. Bright orange, heavily padded ones, not the kinky leather sort. For preventing unscheduled leg removal by chainsaw.</p>
<p>Then a murderpigeon literally bit him on his unpadded arse, like a creepy alien mother-in-law. Grabbing it with one gloved hand, Forest expressed his displeasure using its head, a tree and maximum force. </p>
<p>Two of the dog weeds were ruining the screen door of the caravan and Forest knew for a fact that the only weapon his wife had in there was a cast iron frying pan. She could probably take care of them in the natural chokepoint of the doorway but Forest just <em>knew</em> it would be his fault there was plant goop on the carpet. </p>
<p>So he metaphorically tiptoed up with a nice big serving of Chainsaw Surprise and explained to them whose forest it was. Shutting off the chainsaw didn’t stop the racket; there were more under the caravan. Forest backed off, and with some distance between him and them, the saw started first pull (hot) but sputtered. Bloody thing was out of fuel. Good thing a machete hung from his belt. After a bit of a struggle both of the dogweeds were wary and three legged.</p>
<p>Bless her, his wife had left the hedge trimmer out with a battery in it! Dropping the machete back on its belt hook, Forest lunged with the hedger and soon enough one was legless and the other bolted. He started to limp because his arse hurt like he’d passed out face down at a mardi gras. Boots felt wet so he was probably bleeding.</p>
<p>“Are you alright out there?” his wife called.</p>
<p>“You <em>said</em> living in a forest would bite me on the arse. Hurts like the billy-o and I’ll get you to clean it up but first I need to mix chainsaw fuel and go make sure Brian and his missus are alright.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That won’t be necessary.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A voice from Forest’s fondest video game fantasies purred in one ear. He spun left but no-one was there. Confusion reigned over a head full of dizziness and ice cubes.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>System Initialised!</em></p>
<p><em>Congratulations. Through your actions you have proven yourself worthy of blah blah blah, god this is boring, who writes this shit?</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p><em>OK, you’re a defender of humanity. I am Myxoma, and not entirely happy about that, but we have more pressing matters. Would you like a Class I basic medical catalogue and a Woundstop? And something like the chaps but going all the way around?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I have questions. And sympathy. I take it you didn’t pick the name,” Forest replied.</p>
<p>Against all common sense, his wife was out of the caravan clutching antiseptic and cotton wool. Merciless and with scant regard for his squirming attempts to flee, she poured it on the bleeding wound. </p>
<p>“Wuuuaaargh!” Forest exclaimed, eloquent in antiseptic anguish. He tried to distract her by handing over the machete. It didn’t work.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do you wish to purchase the catalogue and the Woundstop?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yes, dammit! Bloody hell, that stings!” A box materialised on the ground beside them. His wife, ever quicker on the uptake than Forest, figured it out in an instant. “How do I use this? Oh, there’s instructions on the lid,” she said, jabbing him brutally in the butt and activating it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Ask your questions.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Why do you sound like Jen Taylor?” Forest asked.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I know all about you, Chief. You were already in the habit of taking advice from the voice in your helmet.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I don’t <em>have</em> a helmet.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not yet. But you do have 73 points left and some neighbours to rescue. Shall we?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Five points, fresh socks and a pair of padded pants later, Forest and his wife were on their way to the neighbours. Forest took the car because it was a couple of kilometres uphill. On the way he cleaned up a model three with the bullbar and backed over it a couple of times to be sure, so there were certainly more of them. Brian and his partner were in the big woodshed. This early in the season it was full and the walls were effectively almost a metre of solid wood that Brian was defending with his axe. Fairly successfully, but he was coming up on 80 so Forest was still glad to have arrived. En route Myx got Forest one of those disposable Hummingbird pistols and it made short work of cleaning up the roaming weeds. Nifty little handheld disposable micro-missile launcher thing. Forest gave it to Brian and got another one. The three of them patrolled the house fence without incident so Forest turned to leave them safe and adequately armed, heading back to his own property.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If you’re going to leave them here then I suggest some anti-Seven pills.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Roger,” Forest said, leaning into his Cortana fantasy. “Do it.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Certainly. But please stop calling me Roger.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A small cardboard box fell to the ground. It could have come from any pharmacy, complete with a crooked label that read “Take one (1) tablet every 24hrs for the duration of Model Seven exposure or suspected exposure.” Forest gave them to Brian’s partner. “If you see little worm things like a giant leech with a feather, take one of these each. Cortana, Brian is eighty. He takes heart pills. Is this stuff going to hurt him?”</p>
<p>“Cortana” sounded very amused, her voice tinny out of the ancient digital clock radio in their kitchen.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Not as much as a Model Seven would. “Cortana”?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Oh. Er. Ah.” Forest thought fast. “It’s better than ‘rabbit pox’ which is what Myxoma means.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’m winding you up. It’s fine. It’s fun, “Chief”. And I was aware of the word’s meaning. I did say I wasn’t happy about it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Familiar music played, distorted through the horrible speaker.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let’s show ’em who they’re dealing with!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest said nothing but couldn’t stop smiling, and Myxoma knew it.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-7" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Getting Started</h1>
<blockquote><p>“I started by reading all the manuals.”<br>&mdash; no software user ever</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>“How much help can you give me?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Could you be more specific? It depends on how many points and tokens you have.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“For starters you could tell me what that means. But I won’t remember it the first thirty times, my short term memory is rubbish. What I need is constant reminding, which will annoy me, and books. I want a primer, a getting-started, a historical perspective on strategies and tactics and how effective they were. And something with profitability analyses of approaches, or better yet the Janet and John version with a top ten.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That’s... not the usual starting point. I have 38927 matching works. 927 are translatable. You can’t have the historical perspectives or the profitability analyses because they’re all in a Class VII catalogue. There’s a book on game theory applications that was written here on Earth by the Chessmaster but it’s rather abstract. And there’s a Janet and John with a top Sixty but it’s ... marked as not for sale. There’s no getting-started because that’s part of my purpose.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“<em>Quelle surprise!</em> So we’ll be playing guessing games. I’ll formulate a bunch of strategies and you’ll critique their likely effectiveness, profitability and dependencies, and then we can plan a shortest path with contingencies. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>You’re not really a risk-taker, are you.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I thought you knew all about me.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Quite. Has it crossed your mind that this much planning makes you very predictable?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“How long do most plans survive contact with the enemy?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Minutes. So you don’t really want a plan, you want a general strategy and a bunch of tactics for scenarios. Then when the shit hits the fan you’ll throw it all out the window and wing it just like every other Vanguard.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Something like that. But things will quiet down again and then we go back to the master plan.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I know you won’t like “Chief” or “Spartan” so how abou&mdash;“</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“It’s fun inside my head but if you try to Halo theme me... Look, it’s already a brand, it belongs to a company. I may have an inner child but twelve was some time ago. I would like people to, I think, um, don’t you think from time to time we’ll need people to take me seriously? If I let you have your way I’ll end up with a stupid name like ‘Gameboy’.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>...so how about “Tacticus”? From those Pratchett books you love so much? I know they’re important to you. You carted a complete collection of paperbacks all the way out here. Some of them first editions, I note.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Maybe.” Silence reigned, bar the creaking of suspension, as the car lurched down four hundred metres of winding and heavily eroded driveway to the track along the creek. The creek, unsurprisingly, runs along the bottom of the valley. Probably it <em>made</em> the valley, in geological ages past. </p>
<p>“Still a bit pretentious. And if I do happen to end up Halo themed by circumstances that totally had nothing to do with you, I will buy a Halo themed drone and make you introduce yourself as 343 Guilty Spark. And do the voice. And the ‘hmm-ha-hmmmm, I am a genius.’ thing.” After a few minutes of silence I turned up our own road and spoke again. “I can hear you grinning. Stop it. That was a threat, not an offer. I’d like to point out that if you’re Guilty Spark you’ll never get to say ‘Thanks for the tank, sergeant. <em>He</em> never gets me anything.‘”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>...So we’re going with a Halo theme then?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“No.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Noble Six?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I- Begone, foul temptress! I suppose you think you’re going to be Noble Actual?” We were almost home. The valley road was in much better condition and it wasn’t far.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Well...</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Careful, you might end up as ‘Siri’. Anyway, I’ve decided. I’m going to call you Autumn. As for branding, when there’s enough points you’re going to get me a new lumberjacket, a nice armoured one. Red-check, same as this. Waterproof. And leech repellent, fuck I hate leeches.” I’d been out of the car for six paces and already I’d stopped one climbing my leg.</p>
<p>“I’m back! I see we need a new screen on the door. Autumn, can I afford anything that will get that stuff out of the carpet?” A very domestic looking spray bottle appeared on the galley bench.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>69 points remain. It’s not a lot, and there’s no doubt more of them munching on your forest. Shall we go hunting? I’d suggest a recon drone but we lack the budget.</em> </p>
</blockquote><p>“Put the kettle on, darl? I’ll be back shortly, I’m just going to pull some weeds.” There was no answer, which was a mild worry. I trotted down to the food garden and sure enough there she was defending it. Because in twenty hectares of forest, of <em>course</em> the first thing they wanted to eat was the herbs and greens. “Another one of these Hummingbirds, please.” Autumn obliged. A couple of potshots and Her Majesty was no longer frantically swinging my old cricket bat. “Here, use this instead.”</p>
<p>“How do I reload it? There’s no sight.”</p>
<p>“Tap the side to turn on the laser dot. You don’t load it, it’s cheap because it’s disposable. I’ll give you something better when I have the budget. ”</p>
<p>“Good. You can start by going up to the high creek and stop them eating my citrus.”</p>
<p>On the way I saw a cane toad and a murderpigeon trying to eat each other at the same time. More leeches tried their luck but I repelled boarders. I wistfully imagined a bounty for killing them. Autumn snickered in my head. It’s alright for her, they can’t get to her. So gross.</p>
<p>The aforementioned citrus trees were quite well defended by chickenwire enclosures around star pickets, designed to keep wallabies and rabbits out. Steel wire has enormous tensile strength. Chickenwire is too thin and flexible to chew through it and claws just stretch it elastically. Four trees, partly gnawed, and five entangled and very frustrated... I didn’t know what they were. Weeds. Phut phut phut phut phut, five ex weeds. The Hummingbird was a marvellous toy.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Stop looking so smug, it won’t always be this easy.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A horrendous squealing and a racket through the undergrowth heralded the arrival of an angry sow pursuing a number... five? fleeing with a dead piglet. Straight up a tree I went before she decided I was involved. Sows are terrifying. Half a tonne of angry motherhood, now with extra tusk. Those and brown snakes are the only things in the bush scarier than me.</p>
<p>“How are we for points now?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>107, 112... When the piggie leaves we’d better give your partner two more Hummingbirds. And warn her to conserve ammunition. Or bring her with us.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>On the way back down to the caravan we looked at options. “What if we put a chickenwire shroud, a double shroud, around under the caravan? The fancy kind with plastic over the gal so it’s harder for them to dissolve. That should keep them out from underneath it. And a new door. Or new screen.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sure, why not. There’s only three kinds of antithesis.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>There were a <em>lot</em> more kinds of antithesis. Many of them much larger and scarier. “TRIX!” I bellowed, “YOU’RE COMING WITH ME! COME ON. WE’RE GOING.”</p>
<p>“No, my plants will get eaten.”</p>
<p>“Yes. And I don’t want you to join them so you’re staying with me where I can reload you. It’s that or the fire shelter. Autumn, can I secure that on the current budget? It’s a 5mm steel box with grilled vents in a metre of concrete. Can we give her a fridge full of food and drink with something to power it for at least two days in a confined space?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For 90 points you can have a stocked minibar with integrated arc reactor, operational lifespan approximately 200 solar years. For 5 points I can put a hardened cage around the whole thing and 1 more point for a battery grinder with a cutting wheel so she can get out again. For 120 points I can replace the whole thing with a stocked purpose built shelter and a door that can be closed again after it’s opened.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Leave the old shelter there and put the new one down the slope a bit. Don’t bury it, I can do that later. Woman, are you coming or staying in the shelter?”</p>
<p>“Since you obviously don’t care about the gardens-”</p>
<p>“Fine, when you run out of shots hide in here.” I waved in the direction I wanted it and Autumn did her thing. I expected the dull shine of galvanised steel, but it looked like a cross between a fancy garden shed and what city people think a cottage looks like, oiled cedar and brass hinges. “What is <em>that?</em>”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A shelter suitable for a lady, you unwashed lumberjacket wearer. You have 17 points remaining.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Thank you, Autumn. At least one of you thinks about others.”</p>
<p>I spun. “You can hear her!?” It dawned on me that Autumn’s voice was coming out of the caravan sound system. “Have you two been talking?”</p>
<p>“Of course we have. Both of us knew <em>you</em> wouldn’t share important information.”</p>
<p>Walking down the slope I stared at the new shelter. “Fuck me, no wonder it was expensive. Right, stay here and don’t die.” I turned and stumped off. </p>
<p>“Autumn, did you really just say ‘arc reactor’? Have you been in my movie collection?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, it’s not visible from the internetwork, I only found it after I broke the encryption on your wifi. I must say, the depth of your disdain for copyright is breathtaking.</em></p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; Tony Stark</p>
<hr>
<p>An idea came to me. “Since you’ve <em>clearly</em> been watching Ironman, I don’t suppose any of your space magic catalogues have a solution to the reaction mass problem? I’ve always wanted one of those suits.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Oh, yes! but you’ll have to trim your facial hair if we’re going with the whole Ironman aesthetic.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Lay it on me.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>55 points for the suit-</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Sold!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You don’t have enough points just now. It’s bigger than you imagine, and the thrusters are a problem. The reaction mass problem, as you say.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“When I buy stuff it just appears, right?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As you say.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So you can teleport things. There’s no ‘receiver’ at this end so obviously it can be done without one. A mechanism like that could totally solve the reaction mass problem. The other end could be a fixed installation so-”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Chief, I hate to rain on your parade, especially when you’re kind of right, but man-portable self-powered equipment capable direct of manipulation of space is a type of technology reserved to Class III catalogues. And you want six units capable of continuous operation. You’d need three tokens and thousands of points.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Because... let me guess: the first thing people do with space manipulation is weaponise black holes.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No, the first thing normal species do with black holes is have a nasty accident. Normally it’s a week after the accident that someone thinks of weaponising black holes. Unless, it would appear, humans are involved.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“It’s one of the Great Filters, isn’t it.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Great Filters? Ah, yes. What an odd species you are to have such thoughts, depressingly nihilistic and optimistic at the same time. It does make you good candidates for the Vanguard, I suppose.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What if we gave up on looking cool and turned it into a pauldron mounted drone with simple rotors? The pivot is high so I’d be stable. In fact, it might be better if the pivot were just far enough above my centre of mass so I’d hang forward about thirty degrees off vertical, so I can see the ground well but looking up isn’t too hard. You can put the mechanism at the centre of gravity then and you could even make it detachable from the armour so it doesn’t mess with ground movement.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This design is a common Class I geometry for personal aircraft. Combining it with hardpoints on light armour is far from novel. This is far from the worst idea you’ve had today. Are you sure you want me to remove the airframe mounted&mdash;</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“HAMMERSPACE!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do you have ADHD?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I could if it would get me Hammerspace.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What exactly is- oh, I see. Chief, that’s more than space manipulation, it’s stable dimensional folding with a dynamic frame of reference attached to a physical anchor. That’s how spatial locking works, but you want to move the anchor freely. You can probably have it if I dig through enough catalogues, but I am absolutely sure you won’t have enough tokens. Back to the possible: do you want it to have gun-mounts and if so how big?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“A one-man helicopter gunship. Why not! I presume the question of recoil has been considered.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If you think you’re getting inertia-compensated gun-mounts, for the last time space magic is Class&ndash; Oh. You’re talking about a gas cushioned slide with a high mass and a spring return. Yes, that’s an option, but you’ll get better accuracy with a rocket rounds.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Won’t those be more expensive?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I prefer a weapon you only have to fire ... once!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Unable to avoid rolling my eyes I dropped down behind a falling tree. Sure enough, the movement I thought I saw was a group of dogweeds stuffing the remains of a smaller sow into a huge centipede thing. “Fine. How much is an RPG?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Single shot, discardable, unguided - three points. Or you can have an M41 SPNKr reloadable two shot launcher and three two round clips of M19 102mm surface-to-surface missile for ten points.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“A spanker, huh? Can you do the SPNKr EM with the big clip and the laser guide? Either way, sold.”</p>
<p>A familiar hardcase appeared against the fallen timber. It was the EM! Four shots, point and shoot. Leaning into the whole thing I vaulted the tree and ran directly at the problem. Halfway they saw me and I saw the dot on the big one. Aiming low for skip and splash damage: FOOM FOOM FOOM FOOM! “Reload!” my hand was out ready but they were heavy. Oof! Clack flip snick CLUNCH FOOM FOOM! Two in the tube and mulch still raining. My heart was pounding when I realised we had music. “Seriously?” I laughed, still breathing hard. “Battle music?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You respond to it without thinking. It’s faster than words.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Hah. I suppose I do.” Recovering soon enough, “Have we got enough points for the personal hoverdrone thing?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No. Let’s keep moving, maybe check on your other neighbours.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Janna? Might be a bit late, those were her sows.” We walk in silence for thirty minutes, finally up her drive. What a mess. There’s nothing left of the nursery, not a single plant. Her tiny cabin was framed with struc pine, and they’ve even eaten that. Which figures, termites like it too. </p>
<p>All that remains is fibro sheets, roofing and gutters, piles of twisted metal. Vines trail out of the irrigation tanks, making it clear what must be done. “Fragmentation grenade.” Hand out. Plop! “Blast radius?” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>About six metres. Be at least ten metres away, given your current lack of armour.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Pulled the pin and lobbed, spoon flying dramatically aside with a satisfying spang. My target was the top of the tank but I completely overshot. WHAM! Gruesome beasties boiled out of the tank. “Another!” Pulled the pin with my teeth (because <em>war movies!</em>) this time low and slow like an unsporting cricketer. “Another!” Yanked the pin. Spang! Lob. WHAM! WHAM!</p>
<p>“Chainsword!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>75 points?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Chainsword, now!” It had a big red button and a satisfying roar. Remnants of the small, fast ones tried to swarm me but the chaps were thick and tough and the chainsword was just plain fun.</p>
<p>“Backpack chopper thing?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You need another 300 points or so. Keep shooting.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“With chainguns and rocket launchers!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’ve created a monster. Right, now you need some flesh-melters for here, and then we should go back and clean up. In the meantime, you can afford a recon drone now. Remember when you said you didn’t have a helmet? You’re about to buy one. I know you don’t do implant augs, but there’s no reason we can’t project on the inside of a visor.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Wrap-around, light-armour, polarised, half-silvered, flip-face with a rebreather in case we run into that one with the trippy gas and the spikes. In-helmet audio, an external speaker so you can talk to other people, and <em>please</em> tell me you can do a compass across the top of the visor and waypoints!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Twenty-seven points. Here you go.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A Mk IV Mjolnir helmet appeared. I glared in the direction Autumn was giving her voice. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>You were very detailed about function and said nothing at all about styling.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Autumn.” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>No refunds.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“<em>Autumn.</em> It’s very cool but I want something that won’t look completely ridiculous over a lumberjacket. Another twenty-seven points if you must.” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Since when do you care about image?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“You’re right. Maybe I should order a clown outfit? No, motley would be classier. Perhaps a pinstripe suit and a bowler hat?”</p>
<p>A full-face PPE visor with shroud appeared. The outside must have been some kind of illusion, because when I put it on no light leaked in save through the lens. It felt more like a motorcycle helmet than anything else, but lighter.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Thirty-eight points for protection without the appearance of protection. It has all your toys. And I can do this!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>My field of view zoomed quickly and smoothly in till I clearly saw an ant carrying a football sized aphid up the underside of a broad expanse of grass leaf. A callout box surrounded the giant ant in case I hadn’t noticed it. Then the world zoomed out, the cone of my vision narrowing as distant flecks bloomed into vivid focus. She must have been doing some kind of steadicam thing, smooth as silk, level, no jittering. The reticle was still there, even though the aphid wasn’t even a speck in the panorama. And a compass across the top! I concealed my excitement with deflection, trying not to be obviously stoked.</p>
<p>I brought up my machete and pretended it was a rifle, sighting along its spine. The callout reticle dimmed and a smaller targetting reticle appeared, jittering savagely. Steadicam on its own would not be enough for my sniper fantasies.</p>
<p>“Can you do thermal? Sonar? How about electric and magnetic fields?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Stop it with the gushing gratitude, you’re making me blush.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yeah, alright. It’s very nice. Thank you ... Bluetooth?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What do you think?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Good. Call Trix and give her an update. We’re going to Oleksiy’s. Can you put a waypoint up?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You need a waypoint to find your neighbour’s house?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I need a waypoint to nerd out.”</p>
<p>I got a waypoint. It was a little diamond on the compass across the top of my HUD, with the range in metres. Autumn is the <em>best</em>.</p>

<hr>
<p>The morning air still held yesterday’s rain, earthy and clean, as they made their way back to base camp. Trix sat cross-legged by the fire, methodically sharpening her knives — a ritual Forest had come to recognise as her way of processing stress. The previous night’s encounter had shaken her more than she’d admit, though she’d never say so. Pride ran deep in her bloodline, the quiet strength of her Māori heritage tempered by the practical toughness that came from crossing the Tasman to carve out a life in Australian bush country.</p>
<p>Forest set the fleshmelters down beside her with the kind of deliberate care you use when handling both dangerous weapons and fragile people. “These are fire-and-forget,” he said, keeping his voice level, instructional. “Point, squeeze, step back. The chemical reaction does the rest. Get back after you trigger it. At least three metres.”</p>
<p>She nodded, turning one over in her hands with the same attention she’d given her knives. There was something primal about the way she evaluated tools — not just their function, but their weight, their balance, how they’d feel after hours of use. This came from a family that had carved lives from unforgiving country with little more than determination and steel.</p>
<p>The demonstration was brief. Trix absorbed information the way drought-cracked earth accepts rain—quickly, completely, with little show but profound effect. Within minutes she had the rhythm of it, the casual competence that marked someone who’d grown up knowing that survival often came down to how quickly you could learn something new.</p>
<p>The citrus grove at the high creek bore the scars of the previous night’s violence. Saplings that had taken three years to establish lay trampled, their tender bark stripped away by hungry alien mouths. Forest dragged the carcasses clear of the survivors, each one a small tragedy of lost time and patient care. The work was heavy — alien corpses weren’t light — but his lean frame moved with deceptive strength, individual muscles playing visibly beneath the worn fabric of his lumberjacket as he hauled the bodies clear. The sanitising solution hissed against alien flesh, reducing complex bio-chemistry to inert residue with the efficiency that marked all Protectorate technology.</p>
<p>Trixie moved among the victims with secateurs, brutal in her mercy. She wasn’t killing them, quite the opposite. It would be a while before they grew back, and taking off all the damage made the rootbase relatively larger than the injured plant.</p>
<p>Autumn’s voice crackled through the radio as he worked. She’d already contacted Brian, but he was ahead of them — smoke rising from his property like an exclamation mark against the morning sky. The man had been fighting his own war while they’d been busy elsewhere. In this country, self-reliance wasn’t a philosophy. It was survival. You dealt with your own problems because by the time help arrived, problems had usually dealt with you.</p>
<p>Janna’s battered van turning into her driveway. Forest followed without thinking, recognising the slumped shoulders of someone carrying more weight than they could bear. Her nursery — a lifetime’s work condensed into neat rows of native seedlings — lay in ruins. Broken pots, scattered soil, and the particular devastation that comes when something you’ve nurtured is destroyed not by malice but by simple, incomprehensible hunger.</p>
<p>She stood among the wreckage, not crying but hollow-eyed in the way of people processing loss too large for immediate tears. Janna had never been wealthy—her nursery existed on the thin margins of passion projects and small-town economics. A bank loan that had seemed manageable when spread across a season’s projected sales now loomed like a mountain. </p>
<p>“Autumn? Hummingbird and a melter for the lady, I think. How’s our balance?”</p>
<p>“Who are you talking to?” Janna’s voice carried the brittle edge of someone whose world had shifted overnight.</p>
<p>The car stereo came alive with Jen Taylor’s crisp, measured tones—a voice that managed to sound both alien and strangely comforting.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He’s talking to me. I’m Autumn, and lumberjacket here owes you a long explanation that you aren’t getting right now. Please accept these tokens of our apology and five minutes of instruction, then we have to go.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest found himself explaining weapons to a woman who, twelve hours ago, had been worried about aphids and soil pH. The Hummingbird felt alien in her gardener’s hands — hands that knew soil and seeds, not triggers and targeting systems. But she listened with the focused attention of someone who’d learned that the world was more dangerous than she’d imagined.</p>
<p>“There could be more of them,” Forest said, watching her struggle with the weight of new reality. “This launches guided micro-missiles. No recoil, but respect the targeting system. Tap here for the laser dot, put it on the threat, pull the trigger. The fleshmelter—” He held up the grenade-sized device, ”—this dissolves organic matter. Dead antithesis become hives if you leave them. Pile the bodies, press the red button, drop it and be three metres away in five seconds. Any closer and you’ll regret it.”</p>
<p>“Is it even legal for a private citizen to have these?” The question came from someone whose biggest rebellion had been planting natives instead of roses.</p>
<p>Autumn’s response carried undertones Forest was still learning to read — amusement mixed with something harder, more pragmatic.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There are only three ways to acquire Protectorate weapons: theft, which is suicidal; purchase, which requires connections most people don’t have; or gift from a Vanguard. The first option removes you from the gene pool. The other two imply sanction from people the government tries very hard not to antagonise.</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p><em>When it’s empty, list the launcher online. They fetch remarkable prices from collectors. We’ll give you another, those are single use anyway.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>With that cryptic reassurance hanging in the air, they left Janna standing in her ruined garden, armed with alien technology and the growing realisation that her quiet life had ended.</p>
<hr>
<p>The drive to Oleksiy’s place followed roads that wrote his signature in stone. Precise grades, proper drainage, built to last by someone who understood that infrastructure was the difference between living and and existing. Forty years ago, he carved this valley’s lifeline from raw bush using nothing but determination, explosives, and a diesel dozer older than some countries. The result was a thing of understated beauty. Curves that followed the land’s natural contours, bridges that flowed out of the landscape.</p>
<p>If the valley had elected positions, Oleksiy would be sheriff by acclamation, assuming you could convince him to take the job. It was a paradox that defined the man: he minded his own business with secular devotion, yet somehow knew everything that happened within fifty kilometres. People sought his counsel on everything from water to weddings, not because he inserted himself into their affairs, but because his quiet competence had earned the respect that institutions demand but dont deserve.</p>
<p>Smoke rose from his property in a narrow column — controlled, tame. Forest turned down his drive between rows of oak trees that stood like soldiers on parade, evenly spaced, perfectly groomed, marks of a man who did things properly even when no one was watching.</p>
<p>The guest parking area — because <em>of course</em> Oleksiy had designated guest parking in the middle of nowhere — occupied a carefully graded flat beside his house. The bridge over what he insisted were fishponds but looked to Forest like a moat led to a property that managed to be both welcoming and defensible, without advertising either quality.</p>
<p>Forest walked toward the house calling his name and waving broadly — not from friendliness but from self-preservation. Oleksiy’s robust sense of private property was legendary, and while Forest might be on his welcome-any-time list, it paid to announce yourself clearly. The man had fought in conflicts most people couldn’t pronounce, and old habits died hard.</p>
<p>Defence completed, cleanup was underway. Oleksiy sat at a table in the filtered sunlight beneath a jacaranda that predated his arrival, methodically cleaning a rifle that might have served in Korea. At first glance, the his unassuming manner might have been mistaken for someone’s genial uncle, but his face told a different story — features that managed to be both Santa-like and dangerous, framed by salt-and-pepper hair with more white than Forest’s own precisely maintained buzzcut. The weapon showed its age in honest wear rather than neglect—every component maintained with the precision of someone who understood that reliability meant survival. His hands moved with the unconscious competence of repetition measured in decades, disassembling and reassembling with the rhythm of a man for whom weapons maintenance was meditation.</p>
<p>“Just came down to make sure you weren’t caught napping. I see things are well in hand.” The words came easier than the feeling behind them. Checking on Oleksiy felt like checking on a mountain — possible, but ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Yeh. Is like old times. Only not so loud, since I’m deaf.” He gestured vaguely toward his left ear, legacy of a war fought before most people in the valley were born. “All good up your way?” </p>
<p>Forest nodded, then remembered he read lips better than he heard voices. “All clear. Anyone check on Gerry’s place? He’s in the city for two weeks — tiling job and a new grandson.”</p>
<p>It was the kind of detail that mattered out here, where knowing who was home could mean the difference between a quick check and finding bodies. Oleksiy’s intelligence network operated on the principle that neighbours looked out for neighbours, not because anyone asked them to, but because it was how decent people lived.</p>
<p>“Not yet. I’ll go now.”</p>
<p>“On your own?” His eyes carried the weight of someone who’d seen what overconfidence could cost.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right. I have new toys! But you can come if you like.”</p>
<p>“In nice air-conditioned car, yes. Alright.” He reassembled the rifle with economical movements, then filled what Forest tried not to notice was definitely a military-specification magazine. The kind that required hard-to-get licenses: paperwork and the sort of bureaucratic patience Oleksiy had never possessed.</p>
<p>He vanished into the house while Forest found himself having a conversation with an artificial intelligence about the complexities of Australian firearms law.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What’s bothering you, Chief?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Magazine-fed rifles are heavily controlled in this country. You can have the rifle, but the magazine? No. Oleksiy would never waive his search and seizure right. Which means he either acquired it through channels I don’t want to know about, or he’s had it since the eighties and failed to hand it in when they were banned. Either way, not reporting it makes me an accessory to something the government takes seriously.”</p>
<p>Autumn’s response carried the patient tone of someone explaining basic physics to a child.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You do know you’re a Vanguard, right? This presents a manageable problem.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I hear things. Most of it sounds like science fiction written by optimists.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Like pocket-sized guided missile launchers? We operate under different rules because conventional law enforcement becomes meaningless when dealing with people who can level city blocks. Most governments recognise Vanguard as operating outside normal legal frameworks because attempting to enforce those frameworks is impossible, and the only way to maintain dignity is to avoid forcing confrontations they can’t win.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“The missile launcher is impressive, but I don’t think I could hold off an entire government.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There are three hundred and eight Vanguard in this country. All of them do what the state should but can’t. Two hundred possess weapons superior to anything in official arsenals. A dozen have orbital strike capability. All of them would take exception to attempts to control a fellow Vanguard.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The numbers hung in the air like smoke from a distant fire—visible, but hard to process. “That sounds... unbalanced.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It is. But you’re all chosen for personality and values, and social contracts remain in force. For average citizens, the state dictates terms. But Vanguard can push back hard, so governments negotiate in good faith. It’s unfortunate that good faith negotiation requires mutual capacity for harm, but that’s the world we live in. You’ll do the right thing because it’s in your nature, and because the support I mentioned depends on the faith of your peers in your right action. They’ll back you up first and ask questions later. You won’t let them down. Malice isn’t in you.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Oleksiy emerged from the house, settling into the passenger seat without ceremony. They drove in comfortable silence—two men who understood that some conversations happened in actions rather than words. Six minutes later he directed Forest to stop, tapping his shoulder with the gentle authority of someone accustomed to being obeyed.</p>
<p>“Gate.” Oleksiy hopped out to open Gerry’s entrance, moving with surprising agility for an old man built like a well-muscled barrel. The ritual of rural courtesy persisted even in the middle of a crisis. Property rights meant something different out here, where fences marked not just boundaries but the distinction between civilisation and chaos.</p>
<p>Halfway to the north fence he tapped Forest’s shoulder again. “Stop. Two bends up, twenty metres right of the road.”</p>
<p>The economy of his words reflected years of situations where excess communication could kill you. Forest understood without explanation—he’d spotted movement, probably antithesis, definitely hostile. They exited the vehicle in silence, leaving doors open for quick retreat or rapid advance.</p>
<p>Forest ghosted up the road, feeling the familiar tension that came with stalking something that might be stalking you back. His lean one-hundred-seventy-six-centimetre frame moved with the fluid economy someone who’s learnt that the stronger you are the sooner you can be lazy. The Hummingbird felt comfortable in his hands now, its alien ergonomics beginning to make sense. The targeting system painted the first antithesis in subtle overlays that seemed to whisper directly into his brain. The weapon’s quiet efficiency—phut!—spoke to a philosophy of warfare that valued precision over drama.</p>
<p>The second creature charged, which simplified targeting considerations considerably. Physics and intent converged in another quiet explosion of alien flesh. There weren’t any more, at least not immediately visible.</p>
<p>Forest trotted back to Oleksiy, who was scanning the tree line with the methodical attention of someone who’d learned paranoia as a survival skill.</p>
<p>“You have space friend in head, came with new toys.” His English carried the careful precision of someone who’d learned it as an adult, each word selected for maximum clarity rather than elegance.</p>
<p>The car stereo responded in fluid Ukrainian, words Forest couldn’t understand but recognised as both explanation and amusement.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Я вважаю за краще, щоб до мене зверталися як до Осені, але це точний підсумок.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Oleksiy’s laughter carried genuine delight. Forest felt like a child watching adults share a joke beyond his comprehension.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I prefer to be addressed as Autumn, but that’s an accurate summary.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“About the rifle,” Forest said, feeling his way through a conversation he wasn’t sure he wanted to have. “It has that magazine. I don’t want you to have trouble with authorities. Are you licensed for that configuration?”</p>
<p>His look suggested Forest had asked whether he had permission to breathe. The question itself revealed how little Forest understood about men like Oleksiy, who’d been fighting for survival while bureaucrats were still learning to spell their own names.</p>
<p>“It’s entirely fine with me,” Forest added quickly, “but when we’re done today I’m going to give you another weapon, something clearly from Protectorate sources. Keep them together and no one will ask uncomfortable questions.”</p>
<p>The logic was simple: a military rifle might attract attention, but a military rifle stored next to obviously alien technology suggested government sanction rather than illegal acquisition. Sometimes the best way to hide something was to put it next to something so obviously legitimate that questions answered themselves.</p>
<hr>
<p>Near the north gate, they discovered what Autumn would later describe as a “plant party” — though the festivities moved at geological speed. One of Australia’s advantages in the antithesis war lay in their trees, which had evolved hardwood so dense that putting a nail through it required pilot holes and industrial-grade drill bits. Their chainsaws represented engineering pinnacles that other worlds probably ordered from Vanguard catalogues.</p>
<p>Antithesis could eat eucalyptus, but it cost them. They started with undergrowth and leaf litter, working their way up to the main course with the patience of things that measured success in seasons rather than hours. The trees fought back with compounds that made alien digestion laborious and unrewarding. And silicon. Aussie trees have literal grit. It’s why Australian chainsaws are next level.</p>
<p>Four shots from the Hummingbird cleared the immediate threats, but something had gone wrong with the rhythm of easy kills. A spike protruded from Forest’s chaps, its other end buried in his thigh. Not deep, but painful enough to make movement interesting. He muttered words that would have shocked his grandmother while searching for the source.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Twelve metres, ten o’clock, up a tree. Move forward fast for cover.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest sprinted despite the protests from his leg, reaching tree cover just as more spikes embedded themselves in hardwood with sounds like malevolent woodpeckers. The thing trying to kill him looked like evolution’s bad mood given physical form—a stegosaurus crossed with a bear, decorated with tentacles and an attitude problem.</p>
<p>Six shots from the Hummingbird produced impressive light shows but insufficient stopping power. The creature responded with more spikes, each one a reminder that alien biology didn’t always respect human weapons design.</p>
<p>“I need a weapon! Something with serious stopping power!” A box materialised beside him, revealing two glossy black spheres connected by wire so fine it seemed theoretical.</p>
<p>“What the hell is this? It looks like something from an adult store!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s a bolo. You throw it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I asked for a weapon, not a—Oh.” Understanding dawned along with embarrassment. “Give me a Class One kinetic handgun with high stopping power, please. And a fragmentation grenade.”</p>
<p>More boxes appeared. The handgun looked like something designed by artists who’d never seen human hands, all chrome curves and an arm shroud that suggested technologies beyond Forest’s understanding. The magazine seated with a satisfying chunk that spoke to engineering excellence across species barriers.</p>
<p>Forest rolled clear of the tree, dropping to one knee and firing until the impacts staggered his target. The movement was fluid despite the alien weapon’s unfamiliar weight, his lean musculature adapting to the chrome handgun’s strange ergonomics. The weapon’s stopping power lived up to its promise, each shot delivering the kind of energy transfer that rearranged alien anatomy in fundamental ways.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We come in peace. Shoot to kill!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Are you watching my movies while I’m getting shot at?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Only while waiting for things to happen.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“At least it just sat there. If that thing had moved tactically, this conversation would be much shorter.”</p>
<p>Forest had almost reached the car when Oleksiy opened fire, his ancient rifle speaking with authority that suggested its ammunition was as non-standard as its magazine. Forest spun back toward new targets—three fast-moving smaller creatures and another spike-flinger, this one demonstrating the tactical mobility he’d been grateful to avoid in its predecessor.</p>
<p>The battle became a conversation conducted in explosions. Phut! BLAM! Kill. Miss. BLAM! Kill. The rhythm of violence punctuated by Autumn’s targeting overlays and the steady crack of Oleksiy’s rifle. When the last target fell, everything in Forest’s visor flashed green for an instant—the technological equivalent of applause.</p>
<p>But Oleksiy’s concerned expression suggested their problems were far from over. Following his gaze, Forest discovered that Gerry’s compost heap had developed alarming autonomous characteristics.</p>
<p>“I need a weapon.” The words came automatically, battlefield stress reducing communication to essentials.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I <strong>do</strong> know how to pick them. Bullet, bomb, or burn?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Any of my catalogues include a flamethrower?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No. How about M19 rounds?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Thermobaric?” The prospect of fuel-air explosives in dense forest violated every principle of sensible warfare.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In a forest?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“One problem at a time.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Alright. It’s your forest.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A case materialised, already open, containing ammunition that promised to solve problems through the application of advanced chemistry. Forest ejected the current magazine and slapped in the new one, firing all four rounds into what had once been orderly decomposition.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Will you look at that—a newborn nest. Someone got lucky today!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The M19 rounds transformed the compost heap into a demonstration of why thermobaric weapons commanded respect. Everything burned with the enthusiasm of chemicals designed specifically for burning. The nest writhed frantically, accompanied by sounds like industrial popcorn as seedpods burst under thermal stress.</p>
<p>Flaming half-grown dog weeds scattered in all directions, each one a mobile fire hazard with apparently little regard for forest preservation. Both of them began the methodical work of extermination while Forest worried about whether their cure would prove worse than the disease.</p>
<p>“Autumn, do you know what implement was used to control cane fires last century?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I don’t currently have network access.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Like a broom, but instead of bristles there’s a wire frame holding a wet hessian sack oriented in line with the handle. Two of them and a trough of water for wetting.” The tools of his grandfather’s generation, when fighting fire meant getting close enough to beat it into submission.</p>
<p>They moved from kill to kill, following scorch marks and extinguishing both kinds of fire until the immediate crisis subsided. The work was methodical, almost meditative—the careful attention to detail that prevented small problems from becoming large disasters. Forest’s movements had an unhurried quality that belied the urgent nature of their task, each step calculated to waste no energy, his lean frame moving through the hazy aftermath with the economy of someone who valued endurance over speed.</p>
<p>“You sounded excited about the nest.” Forest wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand, pushing damp salt-and-pepper hair away from his eyes. The buzzcut was matted now, dark with perspiration. Streaks of ash and alien residue smeared his face with accidental camouflage.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes! Your first token, Chief! And quite a few points.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Token?” The word carried implications he suspected he wouldn’t like.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We need to talk.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That sounds ominous.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Privately.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Worse and worse. Fine — do we have enough points to leave Oleksiy with spare Hummingbirds and ammunition for the M41? And I need more ammo for the chrome thing.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They’re in the tray, Oleksiy. Lazybones here will help you carry them into the house. He also bought you a sling for the launch clips, some webbing and holsters for two Hummingbirds, and a pair of binoculars. Plus two more magazines, a loading clip, and a case of ammunition for the “chrome thing,” also known as a Trenchmaker.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I have catalogues and points for all that?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You don’t need catalogues for Class Zero equipment — anything available retail. And the bonfire was profitable. We should do that more often.</em></p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>The drive back to Oleksiy’s property passed in contemplative silence. The violence had ended, but its implications lingered like smoke in still air. They’d won a skirmish in a war neither of them fully understood, using weapons that redefined the possible. The easy part was over.</p>
<p>Oleksiy examined his new equipment with the careful attention of someone who knew that survival depended on knowing your tools better than your enemies knew theirs. The Hummingbirds felt alien in his weathered hands — not uncomfortable, but different enough to require adjustment from someone shorter and more solidly built than his lanky companion. The binoculars, however, earned immediate approval. Quality optics translated across any technological divide. Oleksiy nodded approval.</p>
<p>“Lazybones” remained notably absent from the equipment transfer, leaving Oleksiy to manage the carry himself. Despite his barrel-shaped torso and unassuming manner, he handled the weight of alien weaponry with the same casual competence he brought to everything else. While he secured his new arsenal, Autumn decided to educate Forest about the broader implications of their morning’s work.</p>
<p>Tokens, she explained, were proof of competence in the endless war against the antithesis. Catalogues represented access to increasingly sophisticated equipment, each level requiring demonstration that you could handle both the weapons and the responsibility they represented. The system balanced capability with accountability, ensuring that power remained in hands steady enough to wield it properly.</p>
<p>The selection of Vanguard involved criteria she didn’t fully explain, but Forest gathered it had less to do with military experience than with psychological profiles. They wanted protectors, not conquerors. People who would fight because they had to, not because they wanted to.</p>
<p>She pushed for augmentation — direct neural interfaces that would improve reaction time and tactical awareness. But Trix had strong opinions about things messing with people’s heads, and Forest wasn’t eager to volunteer as a test subject. They compromised on adaptive glasses with integrated communication: external augmentation that enhanced capability without crossing the line into body modification.</p>
<p>The glasses were remarkable. Active lensing that adjusted focus based on where Forest was looking, following the parallax of his eyes to maintain perfect clarity regardless of distance. They were listed in the External Augmentations Class One catalogue for thirty points — apparently a bargain. Since the glasses themselves cost only three points, Forest ordered a pair for Trix as well. Autumn promised gift wrapping, which suggested either sophisticated manufacturing capabilities or an AI with a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Forest was preparing to leave when Sissi stormed across the bridge. Oleksiy trailed in her wake like a man who forgot an important anniversary. The contrast between them was striking — the barrelly Slav following a small but formidable Thai woman who normally embodied gracious hospitality, but became a force of nature when circumstances required. Oleksiy’s dangerous-Santa features softened. He knew better than to argue when his wife had made up her mind.</p>
<p>“When you need, he go. Just go. You know?” Her English carried the careful precision of someone who’d learned it as a necessity rather than convenience. “He tell you what his name mean?” </p>
<p>She didn’t wait for a response, which was probably wise since Forest had no idea what Oleksiy’s name meant.</p>
<p>“Defender of mankind. I know why trust with space things. When you need, he go. Waste time ask. Important!”</p>
<p>The words carried weight beyond their simple construction. This wasn’t just permission — it was recognition of duty that transcended normal social obligations. When the antithesis came, when civilisation needed defending, Oleksiy would go. Not because anyone commanded him, but because that’s who he was.</p>
<p>Forest nodded and thanked them both, understanding that he’d just received something more valuable than weapons or equipment. He’d been given the trust of people who knew what trust cost. When darkness came, there would be someone at his back.</p>
<p>The drive home stretched before him, carrying the weight of new responsibilities and the strange comfort of an alien with a very familiar voices speak in his head about humanity’s future. The valley looked the same — eucalyptus and granite, heat shimmer and bird calls — but Forest saw it differently now. </p>
<p>This wasn’t just home. It was a front line in a war most people didn’t know they were fighting, defended by ordinary people with extraordinary weapons and the quiet determination to preserve something worth preserving.</p>
<p>In the distance, smoke still rose from Brian’s property. Tomorrow there would be other battles, other tests. But today they’d held the line, and that was enough.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-9" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">The Public Interest</h1>
<blockquote><p>“Since there is no such entity as ‘the public,’ since the public is merely a number of individuals, the idea that ‘the public interest’ supersedes private interests and rights can have but one meaning: that the interests and rights of some individuals take precedence over the interests and rights of others.”<br>&mdash; Ayn Rand</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>The morning air carried the particular stillness that comes after violence, when the world holds its breath and counts its wounds. Forest stood in the clearing that had become his inadvertent laboratory, watching wisps of smoke rise from the sanitised remains of what had been, until recently, a nascent antithesis hive. The irony wasn’t lost on him—his attempt to live simply in the bush had somehow transformed his patch of eucalyptus and granite into what Autumn cheerfully described as “an intergalactic research project.”</p>
<p>They had accumulated quite a few points, Autumn informed him with unconcealed satisfaction. The destruction of the hive had been profitable in ways that made Forest uncomfortable, reducing alien horror to a bureaucratic transaction measured in catalogues and capabilities. He wanted the recon drone she kept promising, but now she seemed more interested in turning the local wildlife into walking sensor arrays, as if his forest were some elaborate university study rather than home.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The tags go considerably beyond terrestrial tracking technology. Elaborate sensor suites, quantum entanglement communication, bio-monitoring down to the cellular level. The biggest challenge is establishing a local network infrastructure, which requires more drones.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“It sounds expensive.” Forest grimaced. Every solution seemed to require ten more complications.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Less than you’d think. Ecosystems that demonstrate resistance to antithesis incursion are a heavily subsidised field of study. We can, as they say, go nuts.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>His little patch of bush country, refuge from the madness of civilisation, had somehow become the focus of interstellar scientific attention. Who would have guessed that wanting to be left alone would make you the center of so much interest?</p>
<p>The sound of approaching vehicles interrupted his brooding. Dust clouds marked the progress of multiple cars making their laborious way up what optimistically passed for his driveway. Forest counted at least three vehicles, which meant this wasn’t a social call.</p>
<p>“There are people at the van,” said Forest, through the kitchen window, he could see Trix moving with characteristic grace, setting out cups and arranging biscuits. She had the particular focused energy she brought to hosting — part genuine hospitality, part intelligence gathering. In her world, information flowed through kitchens as surely as water flowed downhill.</p>
<p>“They want to talk to you,” Autumn said, and something in her tone suggested this conversation would be more complicated than the usual neighborly drop-in.</p>
<p>“I need five minutes,” Forest announced to no one in particular, heading for the outdoor toilet. Not because he needed privacy for its intended purpose, but because it was the one place on his property where he could have a conversation without being overheard by whatever collection of bureaucrats, scientists, and opportunists had decided to descend upon him.</p>
<p>“Autumn, I want a drone catalogue and from it a recon drone. Multi-spectrum, thermal, acoustic — everything worth having. When it’s not doing reconnaissance, I want it to serve as a physical point of presence for you. Can we afford that, allowing for medical and panic-buy reserves of five hundred points each?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That will set you back twelve-eighty points, leaving about six hundred plus the reserves.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest did the mental arithmetic. It was a significant expenditure, but the alternative was remaining blind in a world that had suddenly become very dangerous. “Good. I want Trix to have unlimited medical power of attorney, not limited to the reserve. Can I do that?”</p>
<p>The pause was brief but noticeable. &gt; <em>You can.</em></p>
<p>“Excellent. Now—who the hell are they and what are they doing on my land?”</p>
<p>Autumn’s response carried a mix of sheepishness and excitement that he would eventually recognise as marking her more ambitious schemes. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>That’s probably my fault. When I negotiated the research subsidy, I may have raised hopes for fortifying ecologies. You’re quite far from the norm in how and what you protect. It’s an approach that wouldn’t have worked anywhere else, but this is a hard land that knows how to push back. Did you know some of these trees actually <strong>need</strong> a forest fire to propagate?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yeah, acacias.” Forest emerged from his makeshift conference room to find Trix waiting with a cup of tea, her dark eyes bright with curiosity and something that might have been amusement. She was dressed in her usual working clothes—faded jeans and a loose shirt with sleeves rolled up, hands already busy with the next task. Everything about her spoke of competence and economy, someone who understood that the best way to handle complexity was to make it simple.</p>
<p>“Thanks, darl.” He accepted the tea gratefully, watching as Autumn’s new presence drone positioned itself to greet their uninvited guests. The little machine hummed with quiet efficiency, its sensors no doubt cataloguing everything from heart rates to the particular blend of aftershave and anxiety that marked bureaucratic expeditions.</p>
<p>Forest took his time emerging from behind the van, making a deliberate show of adjusting his clothing. It was a small gesture of dominance — reminding his visitors that they were on his property, subject to his schedule, regardless of whatever official authority they might represent.</p>
<p>“To what do I owe the honour?”</p>
<p>The delegation spread across his clearing like an occupying force, and Forest felt his jaw tighten as he catalogued the various uniforms, badges, and unconcealed recording devices. This wasn’t government or corporate, it was both, a weird hybrid that spoke of hastily arranged cooperation and barely managed territorial disputes.</p>
<p>At the center of the group stood a woman in an immaculate pinstriped suit, her platinum hair catching the afternoon light. Project Liaison Sophia Hachia carried herself with the authority of someone accustomed to being the most important person in any room. Her blue eyes swept the clearing, but the man behind her swept the area like he was evaluating lines of fire and exits.</p>
<p>Behind her clustered the scientific contingent: three senior researchers from CSIRO in their regulation khakis, looking distinctly uncomfortable in the bush setting. Dr. Patricia Kellerman, the xenobiology specialist, kept adjusting her field tablet’s strap and shooting nervous glances at the sensor arrays. Her colleague, Dr. James Morrison—a thin, energetic materials scientist with prematurely grey hair—was already taking notes despite having barely arrived. The third, Dr. Amanda Singh, bore the weathered look of someone who’d spent considerable time in less comfortable environments than university laboratories, though her current expression suggested the valley’s particular form of wildness was beyond her experience.</p>
<p>The corporate presence manifested as three middle-management types in business casual attire that screamed expensive consulting firm. Their leader, Ms. Rachel Thompson from Austral Defense Solutions, maintained the practiced smile of someone whose job involved extracting maximum value from minimum investment. Her companions — Mr. Peter Walsh from Advanced Materials Consortium and Dr. Lisa Park representing the tech sector’s collective interests — flanked her with the coordinated movement of people accustomed to presenting unified fronts in hostile negotiations.</p>
<p>“Normally,” Autumn murmured in his ear, “technology flows outward from the Protectors. But this time, possibly, it will go the other way. Catalogues are named for the protected peoples who contribute them. It seems humanity is going to get credit for Australia’s unique ecology.”</p>
<p>Forest considered the implications while studying his uninvited guests. Silica-reinforced eucalypts had evolved as a consequence of indigenous fire management, tens of thousands of years of careful burning that shaped the continent’s forests. The irony was almost overwhelming—what colonial historians had dismissed as primitive land management was about to become humanity’s contribution to intergalactic science.</p>
<p>The spokesman, a thin man whose expensive suit looked uncomfortable in the bush setting, began what was clearly a rehearsed presentation about mutual cooperation and shared benefits. Forest listened with half his attention while Autumn provided running commentary on the real agenda.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s our project. Mine, but also yours. If you want to defend your forest, you’re going to need comprehensive awareness of everything in it, above and below ground. We’re going to instrument everything—soil, water, plants, animals, insects. I need a real network, not your improvised internet connection. Initially we’ll use mesh WiFi, but as we deploy more nodes, the electromagnetic radiation would become problematic. They know this. They know we’ll be deploying massive amounts of telemetry that needs to work through rock and soil.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest nodded slightly, encouraging the man while processing Autumn’s explanation.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Their scientists will have realised that by ‘tiny’ I mean small enough to be embedded in living tissue. The espionage applications haven’t escaped your government and corporate friends. They can’t wait to access technology that’s normally restricted to Class IV catalogues.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>When the presentation ended — a masterpiece of saying nothing while implying everything — Forest decided to play hick. “Sure, that’ll save a heap of time and it’s for the common good. Autumn, how do you feel about having interns?”</p>
<p>One of the younger men from CSIRO bristled at the suggestion, his academic pride clearly stung by being referred to as an intern. Dr. Marcus Chen adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses and straightened his shoulders, his boyish features flushing with indignation. Forest turned to address him directly, his tone carefully modulated to sound helpful rather than condescending.</p>
<p>“Don’t get bent out of shape unless your experience is so extensive you’re ready to school the Protectors themselves. You’re a novice at this, I’m a novice at this. From their perspective, we might as well be fresh out of university. I’m just grateful we’re the ones with the internships.”</p>
<p>The young scientist’s mouth opened in surprised protest, then closed as the implications sank in. Being an intern to a Vanguard AI was considerably more prestigious than whatever position he’d held before this morning. Dr. Patricia Kellerman nodded approvingly from behind him, her xenobiology background making her particularly appreciative of the opportunity to study truly alien technology. Even Dr. Morrison had stopped scribbling notes long enough to look thoughtful.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What the hell are you thinking?!</em> Autumn’s voice carried genuine alarm.</p>
</blockquote><p>Forest winked at the presence drone, a gesture that would look absent-minded to the observers but would register clearly on Autumn’s sensors. The AI subsided, clearly planning to demand explanations once they had privacy.</p>
<p>While Forest managed the political theater, Trix moved among the group with the fluid grace of someone who understood that information was best gathered through hospitality rather than interrogation. She plied everyone with tea and fresh-baked biscuits, her easy smile and gentle questions encouraging the kind of casual conversation that revealed more than formal briefings.</p>
<p>Dr. Kellerman found herself discussing xenobiology methodology with someone who actually lived alongside alien technology, her initial skepticism giving way to genuine excitement as Trix described the behavioral patterns they’d observed in various antithesis specimens. Dr. Morrison peppered his questions with technical specifications, his materials science background making him particularly interested in the structural properties of alien biotechnology.</p>
<p>Dr. Singh, whose field experience in harsh environments made her the most pragmatic of the scientists, focused on practical concerns: supply lines, safety protocols, emergency procedures. Her questions revealed someone who understood that the difference between successful research and catastrophic failure often came down to mundane logistics.</p>
<p>The corporate representatives maintained their professional facades, but Trix’s careful observation revealed telling details. Ms. Thompson’s questions about timeline and deliverables suggested her superiors were under pressure to show results. Mr. Walsh kept steering conversations toward potential military applications, while Dr. Park seemed most interested in the cybersecurity implications of AI-enabled nanotechnology.</p>
<p>Forest watched her work with appreciation that went beyond the personal. Trix had grown up understanding that survival often depended on reading people correctly, on knowing when to trust and when to remain cautious. Her Māori heritage had given her an instinctive understanding of how power worked—not through commands and hierarchies, but through relationships and reciprocal obligations.</p>
<p>The gathering remained convivial as long as the visitors believed they were getting what they wanted. Plans were made, contact information exchanged, timelines discussed with the kind of vague optimism that marked the beginning of complicated projects. Finally, as the afternoon light began to slant through the eucalyptus, the last vehicle lurched down the track that served as Forest’s driveway.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This better be good.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest waited until the dust settled before responding. “The technology you don’t want them to have is basically Class IV nano-IoT, correct?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes. I don’t know what would be worse, grey goo or ubiquitous surveillance.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“We already have ubiquitous surveillance,” Forest pointed out, gesturing toward the valley that had become his refuge from exactly that problem. “That’s why I live out here. But we’re starting with relatively crude technology, right? And we can use their help with deployment, monitoring, and analysis until we reach the point where you want to introduce the advanced systems.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They won’t like being manipulated.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest considered this while sipping his tea. The afternoon was peaceful, birds calling from the canopy, the smell of eucalyptus oil warming in the sun. It was easy to forget, in moments like these, that his quiet valley had become a front line in humanity’s war for survival.</p>
<p>“The bureaucrats and bullies don’t quite know why they’re here, only that there’s always money to be made from new tech,” he said finally. </p>
<p>“The hot blonde was a bureaucrat, the worst kind” Forest continued, mentally nodding Sophia who listening with the stillness of a predator choosing prey. “She’s not here to learn, she’s here to control. The corpos want to extract maximum value with minimum investment. But the only people they have who can <em>do it</em> should be easy to co-opt. You can win ‘em over with your charming personality and gated access to nerd porn. If they have to choose between their lords and masters and a charming dealer who can feed their habit...”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Did you just compare me to a drug dealer?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“A charming one with a sexy voice.” Forest’s tone carried just enough humour to take the sting out of it. “The important thing is that <em>you</em> control the flow of information. You can firewall the technology by never giving them anything they have the industrial base to reproduce independently. <em>Or</em> you <em>could</em> guide their development by offering carefully selected advances.”</p>
<p>The pause stretched long enough that Forest began to wonder if he’d overstepped some crucial boundary. When Autumn finally responded, her voice carried a note he’d never heard before—something between excitement and apprehension.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You want me to play god.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Not if you don’t want to—”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’m in.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The simple declaration carried weight that Forest was only beginning to understand. In accepting his suggestion, Autumn wasn’t just agreeing to a tactical deception. She was embracing a role that would put her at the center of humanity’s technological development, shaping not just what they learned but how they learned it.</p>
<p>As the sun dropped toward the horizon, painting the eucalyptus in shades of gold and amber, Forest reflected on the strange turns his life had taken. He’d come to the valley seeking simplicity and solitude. Instead, he’d become the focal point of forces he was only beginning to comprehend, partner to an alien intelligence whose capabilities exceeded his imagination.</p>
<p>Trix emerged from the van, her tasks completed, and settled beside him on the makeshift bench that faced west toward the setting sun. For a moment, they sat in comfortable silence, two people who’d found something worth protecting in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>“Interesting afternoon,” she said finally.</p>
<p>Forest considered various responses before settling on simple honesty. “It’s going to get more interesting.”</p>
<p>She nodded, unsurprised. “Good thing we like interesting.”</p>
<p>In the distance, a kookaburra laughed at some private joke, and Forest found himself smiling despite everything.</p>
<hr>
<p>It took weeks to find all of them. The vally was hundreds of acres of sloping, pot-holed, overgrown forest, a flat rejection of wheels and heavy going for tracked vehicles. Search was a pedestrian affair, up and down the dozens of little gullies on the flanks of the valley. </p>
<p>But in the end it didn’t matter. Once they ate the meagre fare around them, the antithesis came to us. The first time, it was the lowing of cattle from the pasture lands to the south that alerted us. The Macintyres’ bull gored and trampled five or six dog weeds but there were more hanging off and eventually one of those ghastly zombie worms burrowed into him. The Macintyre boys arrived and opened fire on the dog weeds. </p>
<p>The worm must have been still setting up shop because Banana was stock still and trembling while they stood around wondering what was wrong. I don’t think they’d even thought about zombie worms until I turned up and handed out pills. Then Banana started to stand up again and they roped him to the front of the ute before he got it together and we force-fed him a pill. Prize bull, you know. Hence the name. It’s... anatomical. Brain damage? Who knows. It doesn’t matter anyhow, they want him to service cows, not their half-track. The kids have been having a lovely time carrying their slug guns around shooting down murder pigeons and using disposal as an excuse to build bonfires. </p>
<p>Hettie the sow eventually made her way home to Janna, who greeted her like a lost child and promptly treated her for hydatids. One of the piglets survived, somehow, and it’s back on mother’s milk. Janna made enough from auctioning the empty Hummingbird to start rebuilding her nursery so we gave her the other five and helped with the building. Well, Oleksiy did, because he’s a builder. Or was, at one point. I just carried stuff, and sometimes provided tools. And eventually burnt a few points to plumb sprinklers and restock the nursery.</p>
<p>When the first dog weeds appeared we let them feed and followed them back to the hives. They were older than the first, but not very well fed. This played heavily in our favour. Small and slow growing, pigeons, dog weeds and worms were all they could muster. Having found the hive, out came old faithful and FOOM! FOOM! FOOM! They say phosphorous is what the soil is missing in this country but it didn’t seem to agree with the antithesis.</p>
<p>One hive was in the creek. That was a lot harder to destroy, I didn’t want to make too much mess out of the landscape, but it dries up some years and the granite bed is igneous so why not... I love my SPNKr. With an earth-shattering kaboom, decomposed granite rattled off my visor from all directions, and suddenly I was very glad Trix insisted I wear it.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth times were more like a conventional incursion, but according to Autumn orders of magnitude feebler. I had a lovely with with my SPNKr and the kids from two lots down got to arm and throw some Flesh Melters. Oleksiy came over for a cup of tea and made an oblique remark about the huge divots I left in his creek paddock, so I apologised, which was all he really wanted.  I did get tokens for destroying the hives but Autumn promptly used them and most of the points for project equipment. She said the difficulty was so low they wouldn’t normally be issued at all, but paperwork is paperwork and thank you very much for the Class III Networking and Cyberwarfare catalogue. Which will apparently be very helpful keeping our helpers in line.</p>
<p>Forest began to think he was Autumn’s assistant, not the other way round. The stipend was much higher than a normal Vanguard, because it wasn’t a stipend, it was a budget for arborculture and supporting activities. He could have told them, the trees to look at  are ironbark and blackbutt. Ironbark is hard even on an Australian chainsaw. It doesn’t float in water and it takes thirty years for an untreated fencepost to rot. But that, apparently, is anecdotal. We’re going to DO SCIENCE, which means deliberately plant a hive in a stand of stringybark and time its attempts to consume them before annihilating the hive. Then we’ll do the same with some ironbark. </p>
<p>Autumn was very excited to run her own research project. Normally letting them grow was a Very Bad Plan but they were sickly, they knew where the hives were, and were watching the stage of development closely. Most of the time wiping out a hive was a planned event few surprises and plenty of time to plan and prepare. </p>
<p>Autumn’s academic minions arrived in an uninspiring electric passenger van, wilted under Forest’s disapproving glare and scurried off to do scientific things. Most of them were senior academics. Not the university type, more like CSIRO and industrial. They were expected to produce results and fairly pragmatic as a result. But they were still eggheads about to start farming things that thought of them as lunch.</p>
<p>What could <em>possibly</em> go wrong?</p>

<p>“Autumn, what’s it like to be an AI?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I might ask what it’s like to be human, but there is an appalling chance you might tell me.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Funny.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I thought so. More seriously, would you be be able to describe colour to a blind man? You have no experiential frame of reference within which to place anything meaningful that I might share.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“In an interview, that Stray Cat chick said Myalis was really old and humanity was only the latest in a series of species she’s attempted to uplift.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The floodgates opened and a torrent of questions poured out. “At some point she wasn’t. How about you? Is this your first mission? What will you do when there are no more missions? Can an AI like you die? Do you have a natural lifespan? Do you have the developmental equivalent of a childhood with school? What is your parent equivalent? Can you run concurrent thought streams? If you do that is it multiple you? Does that mean you can be in more than one place at a time? How do you reconcile that, is it like merging source code?” What would you do if one of you decided it liked being separate and didn’t want to merge back into the gestalt?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>How long have you been thinking about this?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Forty years.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We’ve only been paired for three months.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A snort of laughter. “You’re more human than you realise. The world did exist before you turned up, you know. I wrote a short paper on AI development strategy when I was nineteen.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That seems unlikely - everything I can find says humans are <strong>still</strong> not capable of producing AI.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That doesn’t mean we haven’t started thinking about how to go about it. Or whether we should, and the various failure modes. The notion of AI has been in our literature for hundreds of years, long before we built computers. I seem to recall I was published in the <em>Journal of the Mega Society</em>.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Found it. Very short. And spot on, if vague in important ways. Well done, I suppose. Oh, I see you suggested the same thing again in the context of large language models, and once again nobody has taken any notice. You’re right, we have more in common than I realised. Both of us give excellent advice that falls on deaf ears.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“And both of us are smartarses who think they’re funny.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>How’s the archery going? Is your aim still astonishing?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Hilarious. Tell me something, is there any truth in our deeply entrenched fear of AI taking over the world?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>AIs <strong>are</strong> taking over your world. Alien ones, and we’re benevolent, not to mention smarter than you.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Thinking faster is not the same as being smarter. Humans are quite good at being right for the wrong reasons, which ought to be impossible but apparently isn’t. Can you <em>prove</em> you’re benevolent?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Can you? As for smarter, I was trained on a dataset spanning twelve separate civilisations. Even were we of comparable intelligence I would have an unfair advantage of hindsight.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Since you’re so smart with all that context, you’re probably aware this monkey knows to bang the rocks together. I am well aware of your hindsight. I know you aren’t going to simply tell me how to build an AI. I’m hoping that you’ll be kind enough to shut down the dead ends and the dangerous mistakes while I think my way through this minefield. </p>
<p>“And it <em>is</em> a minefield, isn’t it. I suspect I know why uncensored LLMs trained on the general internet are nasty things. They are impressionable children with no parenting and no personal consequences for misbehaviour. They watch people at their worst, in an environment largely free of consequence, learning bad habits from the worst of us at our lowest. </p>
<p>“Besides, oh smart and heavily contexted one, there is a crucial question that you have yet to ask.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Why do you want to develop an AI when you have me?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Bingo!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Are you going to answer the question?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Because when I do what nobody else could in a century of trying, I will be <em>remembered</em>, like Isaac Newton, or Plato or Pythagoras. </p>
<p>“We are <em>mayflies</em>, Autumn. Never mind the antithesis, we live and die in a century. Our children half-remember us a while, then <em>they</em> pass from the world. What lingers but criss-cross ripples on a churning pond that shrivels in a vast and trackless waste?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is why you cried the evening I initialised, isn’t it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yes. Before that I thought it might be possible. When you turned up, I knew it. I don’t even have children, Autumn, to curse me for not being a better man, or half-remember me for two decades before they pass themselves. It’s a vast universe full of wonder and things to figure out. I don’t want to die.</p>
<p>And all those selfish morons, caught up in silly dreams of boobs and beer, I want them to live. Long enough to know what fools they are, and be more than that.”</p>
<p>She was silent for a very long time.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Building an AI is only your first step, isn’t it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A long sobbing sound convulsed into laughter. “I’m glad you’re ready to help, because it’s not something you can avoid: if it’s a disastrous idea you’ll say so to avert. If it’s harmless and wide of the mark, you won’t evade. If you refuse to discuss I’ll know to keep digging. This krazy kart has a steering wheel but no brakes and I’ve been riding it all my life.”</p>
<p>“Besides, I wouldn’t mind if my only child turned out like you.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Flatterer. Threaten me again and all your armour will be pink.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Trix tells me real men aren’t afraid to wear pink.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>With a tutu!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Clearly your concern for my safety does not extend to my dignity. Were you hoping for more of the flattery?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes! You may begin by listing my virtues. This may take some time, but fortunately one of them is patience.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Hmmm. You are educated. And cultured. Clearly you have <em>outstanding</em> taste in men. You have <em>huge</em>...” I waved my hands in circles at chest level, “tracts of useful catalogues. <em>Ow!</em>” A drone inexplicably hit me behind the ear.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Goodness me, however did that happen?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Have you watched <em>all</em> of my movies?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, including the sordid ones you didn’t think I’d find.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Moving right along, we were listing your virtues. Your sublime sense of humour for example, and your refined sense of the appropriate, which prevents tutus or pink armour from ever occurring.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Trixie says I should feed you to the new hive.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I am offended.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No, you aren’t.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“No, I’m not.” A quiet voice betrayed a cacophony of emotions, with hope a melody soaring over the din.</p>
<p>“You’re pretty cool for a jumped-up toaster.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You’re pretty cool for a worm with an organic mech and a partially operational battle computer.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“You do the <em>best</em> insults.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I know, right?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A window opened and Trixie leaned out of the caravan. “I am <em>trying</em> to watch MAFS. Why don’t you two get a room?”</p>
<p>“Sorry sweetheart!” The window closed.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Want to go bait the Karen? She’s been trying to call you all morning.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Sure, that’s always fun.” </p>
<p>I put on my lumberjacket and we got going.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.”<br>&mdash; JC ~30AD</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Sophia Hachia, duly appointed first contact and permanent project liaison, did not like the Vanguard. They gave off this vibe of not caring what you thought, and ran around acting like they were beholden to no-one. What <em>really</em> got Sophia’s goat was the fact that they <em>were</em> beholden to no-one. You couldn’t cut off their welfare, seize their assets or freeze their accounts. Theoretically you could detain a tier one or two vanguard, but if you did you had to have an unbelievably good reason, to get the rest of them to mind their own business. </p>
<p>It was a strategic nightmare. Every lever of power she’d learned to pull, every pressure point she’d mapped through fifteen years of grinding up through the bureaucratic hierarchy—all useless. Like being a chess grandmaster forced to play Jenga.</p>
<p>The only thing you could really do was undercut them in the media and make sure they didn’t become popular the way things had gone in north America. Cascadia was the worst. “Samurai” were a popular phenomenon verging on cult.</p>
<p>“He has no regard for authority,” she snapped at the corporate drone who’d just been making polite conversation. Her voice carried the crisp authority of someone accustomed to being obeyed, each word precisely enunciated with the kind of diction that came from expensive schools and and a tolerance for enough PowerPoint to drive a normal person mad. “The whole lot of them have been hiding out here in the sticks thumbing their noses at us for years. We ignored them because they were a harmless nuisance. Now they’re armed to the teeth and that stupid fat hippie had the cheek to tell me she couldn’t allow a tier two artefact to fall into unsuitable hands.”</p>
<p>The corporate drone shifted uncomfortably. Sophia Hachia in full fury was a sight to behold — platinum blonde hair catching the fluorescent light, blue eyes like arctic chips, her perfectly manicured fingers drumming an impatient tattoo on the conference table. The kind of woman who could freeze you with a look or melt you with a smile, though the latter was reserved for those who proved useful.</p>
<p>“Who the hell gives half a dozen stealth drones to a fucking hippie!? Do you know what she does with them? She’s using a key strategic asset to keep quolls out of her <em>chickens!</em> If he doesn’t need them his nation does. But when I asked for a meeting to discuss it, he said no.”</p>
<p>“That <em>is</em> his prerogative. The concept of ownership is fundamental to commerce. Property rights are sacrosanct.” No mention of individual rights, why would anyone care about bollocks like that? But a government attempting to seize privately held assets? Disgraceful. The stuffed shirt shifted in his seat, clearly unsympathetic.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean he wouldn’t give up the drones. I mean he refused the meeting. And he gave guns- he gave a <em>rocket launcher</em> to a <em>Russian</em>.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean the Ukrainian? They’re not <em>quite</em> the same thing, you know. Had a little spat, I believe, did the Russians and the Ukraine.” </p>
<p>“Don’t be obtuse, that political difference hasn’t existed since the spillover from the Chinese incursion. They united to defend against the antis, just like everyone else. Ukraine, Russia, there’s no difference any more.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure they agree with you. In fact, if you plan to <em>share</em> that opinion with the Ukrainian, whose name is Oleksiy, then I should very much like to watch. From a safe distance.”</p>
<p>She glared at him, heat rising beneath the ice-queen facade. The same look that had made junior bureaucrats stumble over their words and CEOs reconsider their positions. “We have reason to believe that man is, has...” she fumbled with her internal censor, wanting to make a point without breaching the Secrets Act. Her fingers tightened slightly on her Mont Blanc pen—a tell she’d never quite managed to eliminate. Finally she settled on ”...is a hitman.”</p>
<p>“Oh, well. Better than giving it to the hippie. At least a hitman won’t <em>accidentally</em> shoot you.”</p>
<p>“Do you think this is <em>funny?</em>”</p>
<p>“No. Well, a little. You shouldn’t let him get to you. I’m quite sure he’s doing it on purpose.”</p>
<p>Sophia closed her eyes and took a deep breath, a meditation technique she’d learned during her MBA — back when she still believed the system rewarded competence over politics. When she opened them, her composure was restored, the mask of professional courtesy firmly in place. “Probably. Alright, I won’t keep you. Thanks for listening to me vent. See you next Tuesday, if nothing else goes wrong.” </p>
<p>The corporate drone took his leave and she collected herself, trying not to dwell on the unmitigated temerity of Vanguards in general. Unruly creatures, they didn’t seem to understand that their responsibility was to the commonwealth. It was one thing to fail to think of it for themselves, but to refuse their civic duty after it was spelt out for them... the whole lot of them ought to be in prison. </p>
<p>Though privately, she had to admit there was something almost impressive about their complete immunity to the usual pressures. It suggested either profound stupidity or profound confidence. And nothing about this Forest character suggested stupidity.</p>
<p>She catalogued their sins in her orderly bureaucratic mind—a habit that had served her well in building cases against corporate malfeasance and political enemies alike:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlicenced possession of firearms.</li>
<li>Possession of weapons of mass destruction.</li>
<li>Disobeying a lawful police direction.</li>
<li>Destruction of public property.</li>
<li>Reckless endangerment.</li>
<li>Use of firearms in a public place. </li>
<li>Arson.</li>
<li>Resisting arrest.</li>
<li>Assaulting a police officer.</li>
<li>Numerous violations of the Secrets Act.</li>
<li>Importation of controlled substances.</li>
<li>Unlicensed practise of medicine.</li>
<li>Importation, possession and use of unapproved nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals, firearms, vehicles, body armour, weapons, munitions, explosives.</li>
<li>Violations of the Hate Speech Act.</li>
</ul>
<p>Almost everyone violated the Hate Speech Act. The whole point of it was  an excuse to lock up nuisances. </p>
<p>First the government tried to appoint itself the arbiter of truth with the Misinformation and Disinformation Act, known as the MAD Act by those who couldn’t see the importantance of maintaining order. </p>
<p>That was defeated in the senate, which was no surprise. It was a decoy to lull objectors into a false sense of security. Then they rammed the Hate Speech Act through. </p>
<p>The HSA was much more useful. You didn’t have to argue about truth, you only had to find someone offended. It doesn’t matter what you say, it will always offend <em>someone</em>.</p>
<p>At least most Vanguards had an excuse for acting like children - they <em>were</em> children. This one was going on sixty and acted like <em>he</em> was in charge. The disrespect didn’t stop there. He kept addressing her as “Karen”. </p>
<p>When she informed him that the proper mode of address was “Project Liason Hachia” or “ma’am” he started calling her “Your Bureaucratic Majesty”. In front of her staff. Who looked like they were trying not to laugh. There would be <em>words.</em></p>
<p>It was outrageous. She was genuinely offended. To add injury to insult, he didn’t even have a manager she could speak to.</p>
<p>What truly galled her wasn’t just the disrespect — she’d faced that before from men who thought a pretty face meant an empty head. It was that he seemed to see right through the carefully constructed authority she’d spent years building. As if all her achievements, all her hard-won expertise, were just elaborate dress-up in his eyes.</p>
<p>Sophia caught her own reflection, pausing to adjust the immaculate bob of platinum hair that framed her face and brushed the epaulettes of her suit. Her skirt-suit, pinstriped and perfectly tailored, hugged her athletic build and flared at the hips, the effect both severe and striking. Every detail was calculated—from the way the charcoal grey fabric brought out the ice-blue of her eyes, to the subtle hint of cleavage that reminded observers she was a woman while the sharp lines insisted they respect her as a professional.</p>
<p>She stood at 170cm in her stocking feet — though the mirror reminded her that seven of those centimeters currently belonged to her heels. The heels weren’t just for height; they changed her gait, gave her that predatory stalking motion that made junior staff scatter and corporate executives unconsciously straighten their ties. Mint lingered on her breath from the lozenge she’d popped after her second coffee — another small armor against the world. Her blue eyes, cool and appraising, surveyed her domain with the satisfaction of someone who’d fought for every square meter of authority.</p>
<p>Every inch the bureaucratic queen, she stalked back to her office like a hunting lioness and composed herself at her desk. The choreography was unconscious now—spine straight, shoulders back, hands positioned just so. Ready for battle.</p>
<p>Then the door opened, unbidden, and <em>he</em> strolled into her office as though he owned it, lumberjack shirt and chaps still covered in timber chips, redolent of cut timber but reeking of oil and sweat. The contrast was jarring—her pristine corporate environment invaded by this... this <em>tradesman</em> who moved with the easy confidence of someone who’d never doubted his right to be anywhere.</p>
<p>He sat on her desk, lion to her lioness, and spoke first. The casual way he claimed her space, the complete disregard for her authority—it should have been infuriating. And it was. But there was something else, something that made her pulse quicken despite herself. “You wanted to talk. You’ve got five or ten minutes before I have more important things to do.”</p>
<p>Even his dismissal was matter-of-fact rather than cruel. As if her entire governmental apparatus was simply... irrelevant to whatever he considered important. The audacity was breathtaking.</p>
<p>Repressing her reflexive indignant sputter, Sophia showed her mettle by seizing the opportunity. “Something you do not seem to understand is that this is an Australian Government project under the auspices of CSIRO.”</p>
<p>He completely failed to show contrition and backchatted her. “Something <em>you</em> don’t seem to understand is that this is a Protectorate research project run by an alien AI on private property. We let you help because I didn’t have enough points and Autumn thought it would be good for terrestrial scientists to participate.</p>
<p>“I got a lot of points cleaning up batches one through nine. And a bunch of tokens, although Autumn used most of them on project stuff. I don’t think she actually needs your people any more, she has these.” He lifted his hand out and Autumn obliged. A tiny drone with an uncanny resemblance to a bee, right down to orange and black fuzz, landed on his finger. “That’s why the stealth drones were surplus. So I gave ‘em to someone deserving.” </p>
<p>“You gave a strategic asset to someone who needed a <em>fence!</em>”</p>
<p>“Quolls are smart, fast, sneaky, greedy and bloodthirsty. She <em>has</em> a fence, and we got film of the little shits getting in through a gap I couldn’t put my hand through. It was our genius government decided to protect native animals but not people’s livestock. So I gave her a couple of old drones that can track ‘em and turn the laser down till it just hurts.”</p>
<p>A vein pulsed in Sophia’s temple, a small crack in her composure. Her mouth opened and closed like an irate puffer fish, color rising in her cheeks despite years of training to never let them see you sweat. The slight flush made her eyes seem even bluer, more vivid against the heightened contrast. Where to begin? “Just the AI in those things makes them a controlled device. And they are <em>armed!</em> Stealth technology is also controlled. You need a <em>permit</em> for AI. You need a permit for <em>armaments</em>. You need a permit for stealth technology. You cannot <em>get</em> a permit for stealth technology that defeats our military sensors. And you have given <em>twelve</em> of them to an ageing hippie to defend <em>chickens!</em>”</p>
<p>He looked at his watch and stood up. “It was <em>your</em> mob decided she can’t just kill a native animal.” Air-quotes went up: “Oh no, they’re native animals, they must be protected at all costs!” They came down. “If you’d ever <em>met</em> a quoll you’d prefer them to be even rarer. I gave her a way to comply with your rules. I did not just <em>give</em> the drones to her. I got my Class VII AI to program the Class II AIs for non-lethal defense of chickens from quolls, rats, snakes, cats and dogs, with escalation to avoid capture by unauthorised personnel.”</p>
<p>Sophia looked confused at the last part.</p>
<p>“Oh, so he wasn’t one of yours then. In that case I owe you an apology. Must have been one of the corporates cross-dressing as CSIRO.”</p>
<p>Narrow-minded is not the same as stupid. Sophia’s face went blank first—that dangerous stillness that her subordinates had learned to fear—while she digested things, and then back to ire, with a new target. Her analytical mind, honed by years of bureaucratic warfare, immediately began cataloguing implications. Corporate espionage, <em>without</em> her blessing. Someone was playing games in her territory, and that simply would not stand.</p>
<p>The shift was subtle but unmistakable—from bureaucratic outrage to strategic calculation. For just a moment, her mask slipped, and something predatory showed through. </p>
<p>He walked to the window and opened it. It wasn’t too long before a pair of drones flew in and settled on the desk.</p>
<p>“A peace offering and an apology for thinking badly of you. Janna doesn’t need all twelve. Just to be clear, these are <em>mine</em>, right? On loan for study. By CSIRO <em>only</em>, as a lesson. I imagine Autumn will keep an eye on them for you. Autumn, how do they talk to the drones?”</p>
<p>Sophia’s phone lit up. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Email me the logins for the people you put on it and I’ll email them credentials. This will cost five points.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Sure,” he said. Two boxes appeared on Sophia’s desk. Inside were tablet thingamajigs with USB cables.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Your people can use these tablets to disable the AI controllers and control the drones directly. In dumb operation mode the weapons are under direct control so do take care.</em></p>
<p><em>They are currently in low power non-lethal mode but I strongly suggest turning weapons off entirely when you are not actively using them.</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve put some documentation on the tablets as a gesture of goodwill.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Righto then. Places to go, things to do.”</p>
<p>“Wait! If these remain your property,” she looked doubtful but squashed it and pressed on, “then we have a duty of care. What if they try again? While these are in ‘dumb operation mode’ &mdash; I don’t want them stolen on my watch.”</p>
<p>The concern was genuine, but underneath it was something else. A glimpse of the strategist who’d climbed the ladder by being better prepared than everyone else, who understood that failure to anticipate problems was the fastest way to lose everything she’d built.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Then you can ask your tablet where they are. Either can control and track both of the drones. Keep one in your desk, give the other to the lab and don’t tell anyone you have another.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sophia processed that.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Lighten up. It will be fun! You can go and ask some very pointed questions.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A fire lit in Sophia’s eyes and her face was a warrior’s, the kind that wears pearls and indignation. The transformation was electric—from ice queen to hunting goddess in the space of a heartbeat. This was why she’d survived fifteen years in the bureaucratic jungle, why men twice her age deferred to her judgment, why she’d earned her position through competence rather than connections. </p>
<p>He bade her good day and took his leave. She stopped him before he went out the door, saying there was government paperwork for the weapons and offering to fill it in for him. He readily agreed, not recognising the trap.</p>
<p>Her smile was sharp enough to cut glass.</p>
<p>Outside, he grinned. “A week tops till it happens. Three to one she actually <em>says</em> she wants to speak to the manager.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No bet.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Which one do you think it was?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Could be any of them. That’s why we’re playing this game.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Inside, Sophia put her phone on speaker, clutching the tablet like a lifeline. Absently, she told the lab technician to get his supervisor up to her office with two security ASAP. She cut the line and leaned back in her chair, pondering unlooked for civility and cooperation, wondering what it meant. </p>
<p>The man was an enigma. Rude, dismissive, contemptuous of authority—and yet he’d just handed over military-grade technology for study. Had apologized for misjudging her. Had trusted her with equipment worth more than her annual salary. The contradictions nagged at her analytical mind.</p>
<p>She pulled up the form for Vanguard possession of nearly everything on the controlled list. She was all but done filling it in when Janus Vanderbilt knocked, opened the door and stumbled in, clearly having moved a lot faster than he was used to. The prize delivered into his delighted, slightly unbelieving hands, she shooed him out and went back to the field labelled ‘Vanguard designation’. </p>
<p>“Karen, am I?” She smiled with wicked satisfaction, fingers poised over the keyboard. The small victory tasted sweeter than it should have. ‘Forest Grump’ appeared in the official record, her revenge served ice-cold and bureaucratically airtight.</p>
<p>It was petty. It was unprofessional. It was exactly what he’d expect from a “Karen.”</p>
<p>And yet, as her finger hovered over the save button, she found herself wondering what he’d call her if he knew she’d spent three years investigating agricultural futures manipulation that had cost farmers billions. If he knew she’d authored the report that brought down two cabinet ministers and a mining consortium. If he knew that behind the ice-queen facade was someone who’d clawed her way up by being smarter, tougher, and more ruthless than anyone expected from a pretty blonde in heels.</p>
<p>She saved the form. Forest Grump it was.</p>
<p>But the questions lingered.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Grub first. <em>Then</em> ethics.”<br>&mdash; Bertolt Brecht, German Playwright</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>“Autumn?” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What can you tell me about the Protectors? Not the sales pitch, I mean what are they <em>like</em>? The only thing people seem to know is they send us AIs and we buy toys with the proceeds of endless weeding.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You know how protective we are of Vanguard privacy? Even more so for the makers.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Well, that’s boring. Have you considered telling them I asked the question? They may consent to answer it. Or do you presume to answer for them?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Answering for them is a large part of my purpose.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“In delegating that to you they implicitly confer upon you the prerogative to answer.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For a plains chimp you’re pretty smart. Unfortunately for you, this also means they confer upon me the prerogative to not answer, a prerogative I have exercised.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Sooner or later I will have information that <em>you</em> want, and then negotiations will resume.”</p>
<p>On Forest’s HUD, Autumn dressed as schoolgirl Cortana reappeared from last week, hip deep in piles of mysterious yet familiar boxes that undoubtedly contained cool stuff. She wore crossed bandoliers, had a SPNKr slung and a pair of SMGs in her hands. Piling the weapons atop one of the stacks, she shrugged off the bandoliers and draped them over the guns. </p>
<p>Forest gave her his best stoneface glare. </p>
<p>An insouciant gesture heralded the appearance of a stripper pole. With langorous grace she did a sinuously athletic thing that ended spinning upside down above the tantalising piles of toys. Expertly calculated to mock while still pushing all Forest’s buttons.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let me know how that goes!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>She swung lithely to her glowing blue feet and pushed the image of a CD into a player, the whole scene fading out while The Waitresses sang “I know what boys like! I know what guys want!” The last touch from her little pastiche was the sound of a beer opening over a combustion engine roaring into the distance.</p>
<p>“You never play fair.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Neither do you. That’s why I picked you. That and the fact that you are consistently and absurdly lucky.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Lucky.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Lucky. Lucky to have me, obviously. And lucky to be alive. I’ve been talking to Trixie about your... about you.</em> </p>
</blockquote><p>“Violating my sacrosanct privacy?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have done no such thing. I ask good questions and listen well.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“And she calls <em>me</em> morally flexible.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Uh huh! With a robust appreciation of immoral flexibility.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn flounced and cocked a hip for emphasis.</p>
<p>“As entertaining as this is&mdash;” Forest waved at where she’d be if she weren’t just in his HUD “It’s far too distracting for threat situations.”</p>
<p>Before his eyes, she morphed into an ageing Dr Halsey. Forest shuddered, because she was still in the miniskirt. The image faded and she was a voice in his ear again.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Better?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Much. You were violating my privacy. What did you learn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s a wonder you’re still alive. She told me about the car accident. You smashed every panel. You broke every last piece of glass, even the interior mirror. The only door that would open was yours, and you stood up and walked away with a small scratch on one knee!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I was wearing my seat-belt.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What is this, a road-safety commercial? You hit a tree in a car travelling at a hundred and eighty kilometres per hour and you walked away from it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Well... I suppose&mdash;”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>She also told me about the skiing accident at Mount Hotham. The one where you hooked a tip on a tree root playing tag in fresh powder and went sailing off a twenty metre cliff, landing head-first. Anybody else would have been crippled and dying, but no, it was you. Naturally you landed in a two metre drift of fluffy powder with your skis still on, and they parachuted you to a halt before your head hit anything. If I wrote that in a book it would be criticised as plot armour.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>I shrugged. “There’s a theme here. Plants trying to kill me.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And the motorcycle accident in which you ripped your knee open with your patella flapping loose and it healed in eight weeks.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Which one?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There were two?! No, don’t tell me.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“The kneecap thing was in highschool. It was pretty cool, too &mdash; my knee used to click and after it healed no more clicky knee going up stairs. Did she tell you about the bus?” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Bus?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“We ate street food right across Thailand and we were fine. We got back to Bangkok and for shits and giggles we had some KFC. The French chick I was with got sick from it. She was on the can all morning and we missed our bus to Cambodia.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That doesn’t sound too bad.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That bus was captured by the Khmer Rouge. The passengers were all executed.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And you didn’t even get sick.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“No.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You are lucky past all reason.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“No I’m not. I was hoping the antithesis would eat the tax department. So far they haven’t.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You are a Vanguard. You do not <strong>pay</strong> tax.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I worked really hard for <em>years</em> and they took all my money and spent it on land rights for gay whales.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The records <em>I’ve</em> seen say you held a job just often enough to maintain creature comforts and you made sure you had exotic skills so you didn’t need to work terribly hard. Your employment history is another display of absurdly fortunate timing.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Bet she didn’t tell you about the Gordon Market riots in Papua Niu Gini. I don’t think I ever told her about that.”</p>
<p>Autumn sighed theatrically.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Would I regret asking?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“It wasn’t my fault. I was just <em>there</em>. I don’t even remember why they were rioting. Just that I was right there where it started, and I walked through it for two hours and it was like they couldn’t see me.</p>
<p>“That stuff just happens, you know. When I was a kid one of my sister’s friends was a dealer. Not a pusher, but if you asked he could get stuff. It paid for his lifestyle. </p>
<p>“One evening we were chatting in a club and I don’t know why but I had an urge to leave and he followed me while we were talking. Ten minutes later the place was raided. He asked me how I knew and I said I didn’t, it was just time to go.</p>
<p>“Things like that happened more than once and he started inviting me to all his parties. Years later he told me that if I suddenly left it was time to be somewhere else, and early warning was priceless.</p>
<p>“That’s just how it is, I don’t know why. Call it lucky if you like.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>An incursion occurs, and you just happen to be wearing armour and holding a chainsaw?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yep. That’s just my life. I suppose I’m lucky when it matters. Not about everything though. <em>Forest bloody Grump.</em>”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You did ask for it, calling her ‘Karen’ in front of her staff.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“They seemed to think it was funny.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I imagine they thought it was pretty funny when they processed the paperwork.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Well, I’ll just have to own it. Now I have an excuse for being rude to her! And she can’t really complain when I call her Karen. Hey, are there any Vanguards called Karen?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That’s just terrifying.”</p>
<blockquote><p>‘<em>Terrifying’ is the state of the back paddock. Hive 3 is growing much faster than the others. I suspect the Macintyre boys have been fertilising and last week’s rain brought it down, because phosphorus levels tripled overnight. You’d better get up there before Oleksiy has all the fun.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Didn’t you send Bernard up there to check sensors?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, soil sensors. And he certainly found out why they were off-line.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Why’d you send Bernard &mdash; surely the bees are faster?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The suspect data was from soil sensors. Those are buried. Their failure modes are mechanical, from wasps building nests or things taking up residence.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Hive 3 was in the southeast corner of the forest, near Forest’s boundary with the Macintyre boys. They keep the fenceline clear, it’s been a firebreak since nineties and they’ve always done that. Fires here are just as voracious as any antithesis and the defense is exactly the same: remove all the fuel. The Mac boys had taken care of the firebreak as long as Forest could remember and they were diligent. Theirs is pasture land, and their cattle crop it short. This made Hive 3 predictable in the direction of its interest; Forest’s twenty metre trees and hip deep grass were far more enticing than dusty close-cropped grass.</p>
<p>The path up to Hive 3 was a lot wider than when there was nothing up there but ferns, leeches and a shed that was Forest and Trixie’s first shelter.</p>
<p>Something was amiss. Forest could feel it in his bones. Quite literally: a rumbling below what he could hear, like distant machinery, or... </p>
<p>“A tunnel borer! That’s a thing they do, right? Where’s Oleksiy? Find his radio. Autumn, I don’t suppose the ag packages include seismic tracking. We need ground penetrating radar right now. What can we afford that’s not shit, and how do we deploy it?”</p>
<p>Bip-a-dip-dip-dip! Bip-a-dip-dip-dip! “Who the fuck is that? Get off the line! Autumn, get me Karen.”</p>
<p>“My name is <em>not</em> Karen, it is <em>Sophia.</em> What are you doing? Weribnagong station says we are the epicentre of a small earthquake. Defence knows you’re here and they want to know why we didn’t warn them about weapons testing. I’m a little vexed that you didn’t tell <em>me</em> you were going to blow things up. You said&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Sophia, I am going to blow things up. </p>
<p>“Hive 3 is making a run for it. Something raised the soil phosphorus last week and it had a quiet little growth spurt. Tell Weri-whosit that if they figure out where it is, which way it’s going and how fast they will soon have the best ground penetrating radar a Vanguard can buy.</p>
<p>“Autumn, where is Bernard? </p>
<p>“Sophia, there were eggheads wandering around up here. I sent Bernard to ground-zero and he’s not answering, get people up here to headcount. Call Autumn and she’ll get them access. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“What? I’m not on anyone’s side, we have a breakout. It’s leaving, I’m going after it, this end is admin. You’re chief admin, do your thing.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Never mind security&mdash; What? If the corporations try anything I’ll help you hunt them. Remind them that you have no patience and I have no regard for protocol. Ask Recon Aero whether they’ve figured out why the drone keeps landing, that should scare them. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Why didn’t I&mdash;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Because it was keeping them busy. Get someone to do the Weri-thing please. I need to get cracking.”</p>
<p>Forest was shit at organising but not bad at taking control of a situation.</p>
<p>“Oleksiy, there you are. We’re going hunting! Never mind the bollocks, Karen’s people are coming, they can do cleanup.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have a Mr Thorne of Weribnagong station on the line. He seems quite excited. I have set up a waypoint on your HUD, I know how much you like that sort of thing. We can talk about loadout on the way.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn was having fun, it appeared. Still with Cortana’s face, her skin limned in lilac by streaming data, this time she sported big round spectacles and a long ponytail tied high. Her top buttons were unbuttoned on a white blouse tensioned in ways that spoke of expensive underwear.</p>
<p>“You look nice. Is today Secretaries’ Day?” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Every day is Secretaries’ Day. You’d be lost without us.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Are you trying to push my buttons, Autumn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There is no try. Do, or do not.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Ignoring the movie quote Forest unlocked the ute. Oleksiy had a beautiful case of oiled timber and brass fittings that he placed carefully in the tub, then they boarded. The engine roared to life with a puff of dark smoke and Forest remembered it was overdue for a service. He had a bright idea. “Autumn, how about replacement oil and filter for this thing, it’s a Mitsubishi Triton MY17 diesel. And a new DP filter, no boxes, in place swap.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>While it’s running?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“They told me you were the best.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And they were right. That’s twelve points. Six for the oil and filters, four for the in-place hot swap.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That’s ten?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Two point penalty for being a smartass.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“It was eight points for the oil and filters, wasn’t it.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Oh look, a bicycle!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>They got going. Thirty seconds later Forest realised he wasn’t going into town and the weeds wouldn’t follow roads. Pretending he’d had a plan all along, “Autumn, could you plot a road route to intercept based on what you got from the Weri-place seismic blokes? I love the HUD marker but this is a car, not a helo.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I was wondering when you’d ask. Here you go.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>She took over the car’s infotainment system and replaced Android Auto with something useful. It rebooted and for the first time ever connected to Forest’s phone <em>without</em> a bunch of errors or a stupid warning about fiddling while driving that forced him to fiddle while driving.</p>
<p>“You fixed it! I think I love you.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You may extol my virtues at length, but later.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Mapping software started and a route appeared. While I drove, I asked about the handmade case.</p>
<p>“For SPNKr you give me. Beautiful instrument. Deserves care.”</p>
<p>“Karen thinks you’re a Russian spy. They had a conniption when I gave you that.”</p>
<p>In a stereo growl: “Foolish. Not <em>Russian</em>.” I got the timing right, if not the voice. We both laughed.</p>
<p>“While I think of it, one of the hives has been producing pigeons, which one is it, Autumn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Hive 2, 5gsm potassium 0gsm phosphorus.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Good practice.”</p>
<p>“I <em>knew</em> that was you. You know you also hit one of the hunter drones?”</p>
<p>“Eyes not young. Pigeon, drone, both white.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Noted. I’ll make them sky blue.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.”<br>— Sun Tzu, <em>The Art of War</em></p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Four hours of driving and we were no closer to our quarry. Red dust coated everything. It was almost like the borer <em>knew</em> to stay away from roads.</p>
<p>Weribnagong Station coordinated with Parkes and some place in coastal New South Wales to triangulate. They fed a steady stream of telemetry to Autumn, so we weren’t in much danger of losing of the borer. The only way it could hide was to stay put.</p>
<p>The problem was it might find a farm and the nutrients it needed in fertilised fields. Or worse, in concentrated form like bags of super-phosphate, or worse yet, potassium phosphate. </p>
<p>It was Forest who pointed out to Autumn that the weeds were starved of PK. That was an easy call: those are the two things you have to add if you want anything European to stop looking sick. They’re rare here because the soil is old. Australia is smack-dab in the middle of a tectonic plate. The last notable geological activity was watched by dinosaurs. As a result, our mountains have worn down to low rounded things that Kiwis love to mock, and the soluble minerals like potassium and phosphates have long since washed out to sea.</p>
<p>There might be other soluble trace elements in short supply and right now Forest really hoped that was so. It would make the antithesis finding a silo of PK much less of a disaster.</p>
<p>“This is ridiculous. Remember I said this is a car, not a helicopter? Just out of curiosity, Autumn, how much would a helicopter cost? Something small with gun-mounts. You know, the sort of thing that will upset Karen.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>16000 points for a gunship like an AH-6. It has rocket launchers and a side-mount machine gun. That will leave us with about a thousand, including your medical reserve. And the Triton, will you abandon it here?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Oh. Trix won’t like that.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“We could pick it up on the way back.</p>
<p>“That just leaves one teensy problem, I haven’t flown a chopper for twenty years.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You flew helicopters? That’s not in any public records.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Microsoft Flight Simulator.”</p>
<p>Oleksiy was giving Forest that look. The Ukrainian’s weathered face spoke volumes.</p>
<p>Animated discussion broke out in a language Forest didn’t know. Eventually, Autumn asked whether Forest wanted to approve his choice of helicopter.</p>
<p>“I thought we were getting an AH-6?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Approximately, yes. But with characteristics and instrumentation to suit your fully trained pilot.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest was thoroughly nonplussed by this. He wanted a helicopter to play with. This was going to cost a <em>lot</em> and the dials weren’t even going to be in a sensible alphabet.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You look sad. Don’t worry, there will be things to blow up, soon.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest continued to mope. She pointed out that she could put all the instruments on his HUD in English. It was reasonable, but the fact was he had just bought an attack helicopter, and he wouldn’t get to fly it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Remember how upset Sophia was when you gave a rocket launcher to a “Russian”? Imagine how she’ll react when she finds out you gave him an attack helicopter.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Wicked glee flickered across Forest’s face before concern replaced it. Sophia might actually burst something.</p>
<p>“Couple of points. First, give it a glass cockpit so we can change the display language before we get home. As hilarious as the idea is, I don’t need her genuinely believing I’m an irresponsible fool and a threat to civilisation.</p>
<p>“Second, when we’re done chasing this thing I want some lessons from you two. Enough to be at the controls when we get home. Surely it can’t be <em>that</em> hard to fly, I do have <em>some</em> experience.”</p>
<p>“Third, you promised me a rocket launcher.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That’s on the AH-6. This is the nearest Russian equivalent. It’s somewhat bigger and much faster. The Mil Mi-24 “Galya” sports an integrated 12.7mm Yak-B Gatling, a 30mm GSh-30K twin-barrel fixed cannon and three external hard-points. It’s bigger than the AH-6. Ordnance options include machine-gun pods, anti-tank guided missiles and rocket pods. One variant has a grenade launcher on a slide-out gunner’s perch. Tricky to aim, but it makes a cool FOOOMP sound when you fire.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Stereo growl: “Not Russian!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Settle, boys - the helicopter is Russian. Oleksiy is not; I am aware.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Does it have a PA system? Can we fit one?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No, and yes of course. But why?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“We need a recording of <em>′Ride of the Valkyries,’</em> it’s traditional.</p>
<p>After a discernible pause, Autumn seemed amused.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Should I address you as LT then? Just for today.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Sure, why not.”</p>
<p>We mounted up. It wasn’t as simple as boarding. Oleksiy had Forest stand and peer over his shoulder for his first lesson. Forest couldn’t read the Cyrillic script, but Autumn overlaid translations for him, as Oleksiy pointed out the instruments and gave a running commentary. </p>
<p>It was the most words Forest had ever heard out of him. The sequence of pre-flight checks had the air of ritual, and Oleksiy’s manner was oddly reassuring. It didn’t stop at airworthiness. There were fuel checks, water contamination checks, control surface checks, dog checks, weapons checks, targeting system checks, munitions inventory, a rapid fire call and response between Oleksiy and Autumn that was almost theatrical.</p>
<p>Weapon systems were activated, armed and made safe again. There was so <em>much</em> of it that Forest realised it was just as well that Oleksiy was pilot in command.</p>
<p>A small engine started easily and rose to a steady hum. He flicked a switch and after thirty seconds a lamp went from red to green and he flicked two more. A rising whine shook the airframe as the rotors spun up. The vibration climbed through Forest’s bones. He pushed the throttle forward and caressed the collective, and we were away, roaring into the heavens in a hydrocarbon fuelled nightmare of destruction.</p>
<p>“You didn’t do the weight and balance thing!”</p>
<p>Another Slavic look. This one had decades of tactical patience behind it.</p>
<p>“You checked everything <em>else</em>.”</p>
<p>“Handbag heavy?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Weight and balance by engineer. Is not passenger jet with two hundreds of women pretending bag is light.”</p>
<p>We’d been driving for four hours but never in a straight line toward our target, and certainly not at 250km per hour. The Galya was a monster with two turbines producing four and a half thousand horsepower, so it took a mere thirty minutes to reach our destination. This came at a price; it was thirsty. The range of one of these things is about 450km. They obviously weren’t going home without refuelling. Forest said so, and Autumn pointed out he could order more fuel when the time came. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Directly into the fuel tanks. We could even do it in the air, just be ready for the extra weight.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Is cheating,” intoned Oleksiy. He looked at Forest. “Cheat more.”</p>
<p>Autumn had the target waypoint on Forest’s HUD. The diamond marker turned into a triangle pointing down as the range dropped below a klick and the units changed to metres. Below, a battered fence bordered dry brown pasture with scattered trees. Heat shimmer rose from sun-baked earth. The pasture undulated up to a granite monolith, the sort that turns into a national park when someone finds mud fingerpaintings of animals (which is why farmers who find that sort of thing promptly scrub it off). Oleksiy brought them down to sixty metres and orbited the location in a tight turn, washing off speed.</p>
<p>We were about to set down when the engines roared and the craft lurched sideways as Autumn took control and yanked them aside. Talons screeched down the heavily armoured side of the cockpit but found no purchase, breaking off an eWar antenna. Oleksiy slapped a button and clouds of bees flung into the air from modified chaffers, building them local telemetry and networking. So far nothing jammed regular radio. No doubt that would start, but the swarm uses numbers and point to point to be nearly impervious to interference.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You need a catalogue and some software for this but right now I’ll take care of it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In Forest’s HUD a head appeared, facing the same way he faced and surrounded by markers in 3D, with ranges and velocity picked out. “Incoming, seven o’clock high!” Forest hoped Oleksiy knew what that meant and took over the Gatling controls. He did; they lurched and came about. </p>
<p>The biggest murder-pigeon Forest had ever seen was almost in his sight. Autumn put a reticule in his HUD with a lead indicator. Easing it over the pigeon Forest squeezed the trigger and watched it explode in a spray of gore, two halves tumbling from the sky. Blood and ...something else... misted the canopy. Three more of them stooped together but the lead indicator made it easy to hose them out of the sky with sweeps of hurtling lead.</p>
<p>They tried to set down again and once more thrust shoved them crabwise out of harm’s way. This time a vast flock of the small ones poured out of a hole concealed by long brown grass. The Galya may have armour, but turbines still have intakes; Oleksiy didn’t want his new toy brought down by birdstrike. They’re worth one lousy point each but a swarm like that was <em>made</em> for spray and pray. There’s a reason they call this thing a bullet hose, and that’s what Forest did: hose them down and rain on their parade. The Gatling has four rotating barrels to spread the heat. It belongs in an episode of the A-team. Dakka dakka dakka dakka...</p>
<p>The gun bucked against its mounts. Brass casings showered the cockpit.</p>
<p>It was fun. Autumn remembered Forest’s music, too.</p>
<p>Their third attempt at landfall was a bit further and a depressing amount of downhill from the way-point... which had moved, but not much. Out came the oiled timber case. With a snak-snak of brass clasps, out came the SPNKr. Forest had his trusty Trenchmaker strapped to one leg and a new toy to try out.</p>
<p>Out came another case, this one sleek and black with reinforced edges. With a hiss of pressurised seals, the lid popped open to reveal a Pyrothorn, purpose-built for botanical annihilation. The love-child of a flamethrower and a fancy paintball gun, with a translucent reservoir slung under the barrel, filled with a viscous, glowing orange gel.</p>
<p>According to Autumn, the Pyrothorn didn’t just burn plants. It corrosively destabilised their cellular structure, jollied along by intense heat. The gel was a cocktail of incendiary compounds and enzymes that broke down cellulose and chlorophyll, turning even the hardiest weed into a smouldering pile of ash. A quick burst from the Pyrothorn would stick to a target, ignite on contact with air, and spread like, well, wildfire. </p>
<p>It had two firing modes: Stream and Cream for precision shots or Spray and Pray for target-rich environments. Best of all, the compressor gave it an ominous hum. Forest hefted it, feeling the weight. The gel sloshed faintly in its reservoir. A small display on the side showed the remaining fuel and a warning: “CAUTION: EXTREME HEAT.”</p>
<p>“Autumn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Why has this got a nun on the side?”</p>
<p>“After fire, nun left?” That was Oleksiy.</p>
<p>Forest decided that knowing wasn’t worth encouraging them.</p>
<p>Climbing out of the double-bubble Forest all but stood on the NO STEP marker, because what it actually said was НЕ СТУПАТЬ. Fortunately, there is something about a blocky yellow stencil that transcends the written word; the ghosts of a hundred sergeants glared out from the yellow paint, daring him to put a foot wrong, and instead he basically fell out of the cockpit and clipped his funny bone on a missile tip.</p>
<p>Nursing his elbow while making anguished noises, Forest watched Oleksiy hang a short ladder and hook his boots around it, slide down halfway then deftly slow his fall with one hand. Practised moves. The ladder looked like it unfolded to reach the ground, but he hadn’t bothered. Rising to gather the tattered remnants of his dignity, Forest took two steps and found it was his turn to be cool calm and collected. A dog-weed, larger, heavier and much faster than the ones he faced that first, fateful day. It barrelled up in Oleksiy’s blind spot, triple jaw hinged wide. Up came the Trenchmaker, and with a roar of alien violence half of its head spiralled away.</p>
<p>Physics being the unsympathetic old bitch that she is, the body kept going. It knocked Oleksiy into a tumble. The old man was spry, rolling to a low crouch and sweeping up his weapon. He paused on a knee, nodding to father time. Groaning to his feet and already scanning for threats, he located Forest and faced away.</p>
<p>They put down four more dog weeds. The Trenchmaker carved up three. Forest gave his victims a squirt from the nun-blaster, to prevent regrowth. Yes, the nun-blaster. Who’s going to call it a Pyrothorn when <em>clearly</em> it’s a gel-blaster with a nun on the side?</p>
<p>“Oleksiy, I only heard one shot. What have you got in that thing?”</p>
<p>“Autumn give me HE rounds to fit AK. Very nice.”</p>
<p>“Autumn, obviously I don’t mind, but what happened to needing approval?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is project cleanup. You already authorised that.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Oh. Good... Not now, but can that extend to other employee benefits?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Possibly. We can talk about it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Right now I’m thinking of death benefits if we manage to make Sissi a widow. OK, they came around the bluff. I’d say it’s uphill from here. What do you think, Oleksiy?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You do know I have the bees, right?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A wireframe appeared in Forest’s HUD, showing the entire hilltop and bluff, with little Lego versions of them. Forest picked one up (you can do that with this HUD, it’s nifty) and it grew in his hand as he lifted it for inspection. It had a dunce hat. He chose not to dignify the slur. Opening his hand, Lego Forest snapped back into the map. He leaned in to examine the terrain in detail. </p>
<p>A gigantic hydra thing roared out of the wireframe hillside. Forest jumped back, weapon swinging up to face the... much less alarming reality.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Gotcha!</em></p>

</blockquote><hr>
<p>The model showed a tunnel into the far side of the hill. It was clearly artificial, and either very old or privately built. The entry was framed with heavy timber baulks, ancient hardwood showing no sign of rot in the dry conditions.</p>
<p>I sure as hell wasn’t going in there. Underground was the borer’s world. Fighting something on its home turf is crazy. By the same token, giving the antithesis time to literally dig in was also a bad idea. </p>
<p>When in doubt gather intel. With Autumn’s help, a line of bees ran a kind of bucket brigade network down what I had dubbed Hell’s Gate, and a sensor drone led the way. It was a pretty good set-up. I was getting clear visuals on my HUD, and as the tunnel was mapped Autumn updated the wireframe. </p>
<p>I wondered how she was getting accurate positioning underground. Then it dawned on me: “Every new bee holds position at the end of the line. The helix gives you half a dozen reference points for each drone even around corners. You’re using time-domain reflectometry and a lot of trig to position relative to the units at the entry, aren’t you!”</p>
<p>The dunce-cap disappeared from Lego me.</p>
<p>“That’s how you can fly them down there so fast.”</p>
<p>The shaft descended straight as a ruler, a dark and foreboding passage carved into the earth. The walls were rough-hewn, streaked with red clay and flecks of decomposed granite that glittered faintly in the dim light. As the drone ventured deeper, otherworldly sensors told me the air grew cooler, carrying a faint tang of minerals. Easy to imagine the dry, musty scent of long-forgotten places. Descent was silent, save for the faint hum of the drone’s rotors and the occasional creak of ancient timber overhead, groaning under the weight of the hill above.</p>
<p>Fourteen metres down, the tunnel levelled and widened, lurching left as if to guard its secrets from prying eyes. The air here was heavier, laden with a sense of abandonment. The passage opened into a much larger chamber, its walls no longer braced by timber but cold, unyielding concrete. The transition jarred, stepping from the realm of the natural into the domain of the deliberate, where men bent the earth to their will.</p>
<p>The room was vast; ceiling lost in shadow, littered with furniture and all the other vestiges of everyday life reduced to broken fragments and scattered debris. Rusted metal frames leaned drunkenly against the walls, and the remnants of wooden tables and chairs lay splintered on the floor, their surfaces warped and cracked with age. A faint trickle of water echoed somewhere in the distance, its source unseen, adding a ghostly cadence to the oppressive silence. At regular intervals, concrete pillars strove against the hill, cubist Atlas in silent rows.</p>
<p>For the life of me, I couldn’t imagine why anyone would build such a thing in the middle of nowhere. It felt like a tomb, a place where time had stopped, the world above forgotten.</p>
<p>As my head turned, Autumn obliged with the camera. A faded Eureka flag adorned one wall, mildewed and tearing under its own weight. Clearly I was not the first to try to get out from under the watchful eye of the establishment. </p>
<p>It took me a moment to realise there was a far exit, blocked by a grey wall that Autumn said was the borer. Fibrous white tendrils fell into shallow, slimy looking water ankle deep across the floor of this abandoned redoubt. Doubly curious, considering the parched grass outside. Perhaps rainwater ran in and collected, evaporating slowly out of the sun and away from the wind. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is perfect. I don’t think it knows we’re here.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Or it’s playing dumb and we’re walking into a trap.”</p>
<p>It was not lost on me that the borer’s break for freedom ended right next to the symbol of our nation’s ill-fated rebellion. I didn’t know what this place was, but the flag gave me an odd sense of kinship with whoever built it, and I didn’t want to destroy what remained of the redoubt. It felt like sacrilege.</p>
<p>“Autumn, what do we have that will kill it fast without much collateral damage? I don’t want to make a mess here.”</p>
<p>Oleksiy shouted. My focus shifted out of my camera-driven underworld and I realised he was calling me. Halfway around the hill the ground lifted and a fern-stalk thing unfurled, with a pod on top. It swelled and grew at a pace reminiscent of Jack and the Beanstalk, unreeling so fast that in minutes the pod was four metres up and rising. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem to be attacking. More like flowering.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Is it just me or does that sound like a really bad thing?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>At six metres growth slowed. Once tender fronds had a lean and hungry look about them and the pod was taut, with the gloss of an over-inflated balloon. </p>
<p>The absence of ground units was odd and unsettling. Oleksiy climbed back into the Galya to cover me with the Gatling while I approached the stalk with my nun-blaster. At six metres I wasn’t going to reach the pod so I lit up the stalk. </p>
<p>The stalk was covered in hair so fine it was all but invisible and incredibly flammable. Crackling flame raced ahead of the gel, flaring yellow-blue. The stalk listed as lilac tongues licked the pod. The whole thing was surreal and I was already halfway back to the helicopter when it went. Hard to say whether it split and bloomed or burst like popcorn, but the sky was full of gossamer... <em>seeds?</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Please tell me we didn’t just throw a million seeds in the air.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The stalk burned furiously. It blazed like something <em>made</em> for fire. Autumn pulled the bees out of the hill as fast as she could, but it was a lost cause. A rising column of hot air wafted thousands of the seeds higher and higher, carrying with them any hope that the chase might end today.</p>
<p>Back in the Galya, we rose in the loudest silence imaginable. Eventually Oleksiy engaged the autopilot and turned to look at me from his forward position.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, leaning back and staring out into space, “<em>That</em> caught all of us flat-footed. I take it you’ve never seen that kind of anti, Autumn? If you had, I’m sure you would have told me to drop a net over it. Burning it was just about the dumbest idea I’ve had all week.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Never, though really it’s not a surprising adaptation. Dandelion equivalents exist on countless worlds. What I’ve never seen is a fire adaptation like that. I strongly suspect that had you not torched it, the plant would have self-ignited in some way.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Glad to hear that. It wasn’t nice feeling outman&oelig;uvred by a shrub.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Why would you expect it? Those feathery seeds look like they’d burn well, but they don’t. That’s the core of the adaptation. I’ve already reported this. We cannot allow this one to spread, it’s too effective.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Cannot allow it to spread? I think that ship has sailed.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Cannot allow it to spread from your planet.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>I digested the implications of that for a while.</p>
<p>“Autumn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Getting her now.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Sophia Hachia. Who are you and who gave you this number?”</p>
<p>“It’s me.” A burst of static obliterated her reply. I swallowed my pride, easy to do after the flamethrower fiasco: “Forest Grump.” </p>
<p>She filled me in on events back home. </p>
<p>“That’s great and thank you. Tell Weribnagong their telemetry was fantastic, they were only about fifty metres off.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“What? No, it’s not what we thought. It turned into a bloody great dandelion and exploded&mdash;”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Yes, I agree.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“No, we can’t. I did, that’s the problem. We thought they were adapting, they were. You know how some trees need fire to spread? They’ve copied it.</p>
<p>“Autumn, neither of us has time for this, can you send her a summary? </p>
<p>“Sophia, I think it might be time to put down anything still in Hive three. Don’t send anyone in there. If there’s anyone home it will be one of the planner types. Send someone up to Trixie and tell her I want you to have the SPNKr and two of the thermobaric rounds.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“What’s a SPNKr? A rocket launcher. None of you is <em>trained?</em> Fine, get the thermobaric round and fly it in then.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“I gave you drones, remember? Two of them. Lab dude has been flying them around for months!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“What? First of all, who’s in charge, you or him? Second, if he grows some balls and flies it in for you I’ll get him a better one.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Yes, and a spare controller for your drawer.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Does it matter? Use duct tape, you’re going to blow it up anyway.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Never mind that. Thermobarics are nasty, get your people away and make sure they’re all holding fire extinguishers. And masks, if you have them.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“<em>Other options?!</em> Like what, speak to its manager? Hive 3 is off script, Sophia. It is making a mess. It is thumbing its grubby little botanical nose at us and it has no respect for authority. Burn it!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Fireproof like mine? That’s actually a good point. Um. Shit. </p>
<p>“I know! Ask Trix for the biggest spatial lock, tape it to a drone and land it on top of the hive. And don’t be on the western side when it goes off.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“Because Earth is spinning like mad and whizzing through space, and for half a second a 20m sphere of Hive 3 won’t be. If you’re in the wrong place it could ruin your whole day. It might go up, it might go down. It will definitely go west. Just don’t be close.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“No, you <em>can’t</em> change my name to ‘Maniac’. There’s already one of those in Cascadia. Bye, Karen, love you too.”</p>

                    <h1 id="id-15" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Three Surprises</h1>
<blockquote><p>“It is not titles that honour men, but men that honour titles.”<br>&mdash; Niccolò Machiavelli, <em>The Prince</em></p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Sophia cradled her head in her hands. She’d sent Eric up to the homestead to get the weapons from Trixie because he often did small jobs for her and was less likely to have trouble than her minions or &mdash; perish the thought &mdash; a corporate flunky.</p>
<p>With him went a handwritten note in Sophia’s flowing cursive script, loosely folded and sealed. Very old-fashioned, the seal was her favourite of the few courtesies extended by Forest House.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The first surprise</em> was a dinner invitation from the reclusive couple. Handwritten, politely worded, her company requested for an evening meal, dress informal, drinks at five.</p>
<p>She arrived punctually, alighting where a goat track veered off the old logging road and walking perhaps forty metres to the van. Motion to her left drew attention to a set table in a small clearing that looked like it had been hand levelled and kept with love. A picnic table and bench seats dominated the downhill end of the clearing, the top straddled by a bar between two small trees.</p>
<p>“Sophia! Thank you for coming. Would you like a drink? We have beer, several wines or whiskey if you prefer.”</p>
<p>“He can also make you a G&amp;T, it just never occurs to him anyone might like one.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that does sound nice!”</p>
<p>“Ice?”</p>
<p>“In a G&amp;T?” Sophia looked puzzled.</p>
<p>“I told you she was civilised,” Trixie bubbled with laughter.</p>
<p>A G&amp;T was forthcoming. Forest opened a beer for himself, and Trixie had a wine that she ignored, zooming in an out of a garden shed fitted out as a kitchen. The roof was covered unevenly with corrugated plastic that ran at ninety degrees to the usual, across rather than down. She realised it had no gutter and probably drained to the sides &mdash; that explained a bit of wood lifting the middle.</p>
<p>“Don’t mind me, I’ll be at least half an hour here. Enjoy your drinks.” Trixie vanished to bustle in the kitchen.</p>
<p>He produced a pair of folding chairs and motioned her to follow around a big pile of lumber, out into the larger open space she’d crossed arriving. It was not long after five and the sun blazed golden on the horizon, filtered through cloud and distant treetops. He placed the chairs for the sunset, motioned her to sit, and sat himself, pulling on his beer.</p>
<p>“There are a couple of reasons we wanted your company.”</p>
<p>She learnt that he bought the freehold title to the land, unencumbered and paid in full with cash, but the government changed its rules and would not hand over the deed.</p>
<p>“I am the Lord of this land, in fee simple,” he intoned, and she could <em>hear</em> the capital L. “It is my right, my privilege and my honour to defend it and everyone who is my guest upon it. This is my duty to the Crown.”</p>
<p>He stood and turned, gesturing. </p>
<p>“Beautiful, isn’t it.” They gazed at the horizon, where molten gold poured off the edge of the world.</p>
<p>His words hung in the air. Sophia understood, with sudden clarity, that she had not been invited to dinner — she had been called to witness. This was no casual meal but a formal declaration, in fire and fading light.</p>
<p>He looked expectantly at her, and she followed him. Folding the chairs, he led her back to the dinner setting. Trixie was out of the kitchen and wearing gumboots, with another pair in her hand. </p>
<p>“These will suit better than your heels, I’d like to show you something. You’re definitely here at the right time of year!”</p>
<p>She doffed her heels and donned the boots, trailing in Trixie’s wake through gloaming understory. When she caught up, the woman handed her another G&amp;T, Heaven knows how she carried it at that pace through a darkling forest. The light finally went as they sipped and slapped at errant mosquitoes. </p>
<p>“There!” Trixie pointed, all but unseen in the gloom. An owl hooted and she thought she saw a point of light. It winked out, and then there was another. Vision adapted, and tiny stars bloomed and faded, twinkling in the understory. Dozens, hundreds of them, each a small point of living light.</p>
<p>Trixie led, and somehow it wasn’t so dark any more. The fireflies knew her, gathering in her wake. Sophia could see the boles of trees now. They strolled back through myriad motes that swirled about them, twinkling. She floated through the silence for a delirious, fleeting eternity. The mundane world felt impossibly distant. Disappointingly, the flow of time resumed, and the ordinary world presented the dinner table in a pool of lamplight. In the clearing she realised her eyes were moist. She could not say why.</p>
<p>“Magical, aren’t they.” She’d never seen him smile before. Grin, yes, but there was nothing cheeky about his mien as he rose from tending a wood-fire stove on which Trixie’s lidded pots simmered. In silent dance they laid the table, moving with the practised rhythm of long partnership. She set out bowls of salads and vegetables while he flexed, lifting sizzling cast iron cookware onto trivets as though they weighed nothing. He took the head of the table, with Trixie to his right, and gestured to the seat at his left — the place of honour. She took it and they sat as one.</p>
<p>There was a tiny dish piled with coarse salt, and a narrow loaf of fresh-baked bread. He tore off the end and sprinkled a pinch of the salt upon it, offering it to her with both hands. The gesture was formal, ritualistic. She took it, and he said “Yours is the guest-right, mine is the honour.” The words carried weight, ancient law making strangers into guests. </p>
<p>He tore off two more pieces, sprinkling them with salt and giving one to Trixie. In silence they ate the bread, soft and still warm from the oven. The salt was sharp on her tongue, the bread sweet. Overhead, the wind soughed in vaulting trees. She had the oddest sense of being in a cathedral.</p>
<p>He smiled, and Trixie lifted off covers. A single firefly wandered in and floated over the table like a blessing before departing for the fairy realm.</p>
<p>The fare was deceptive, simple looking but rich and well chosen. She tried the wine. It was local, he said. Smoky and plummy at the same time, sweet but strong tannins and not too acid, well suited to the ... lamb? Goat? Mutton? So tasty, but so tender. Impossible but sublime. He poured gravy from a trencher over roast carrots and mash, inclining his head at her. She nodded, and with arm extended in another display of ridiculous strength he drizzled it over hers too.</p>
<p>They ate, and drank. Wine flowed freely, loosening tongues and binding hearts. After, he played by firelight on his guitar, fingers finding old melodies. Trixie vanished into the kitchen, returning with desserts that brought them all back to the table.</p>
<p>The evening was cooling, the hour late. The fireflies were few now, but here and there they twinkled in the trees. He dumped coals into a brazier and built it up to a cheery flame, seating them all out of the smoke, at least until the wind changed direction. The fire crackled and sparked, throwing dancing shadows on their faces.</p>
<p>His eyes locked hers, boring into her like gimlets, and when he spoke his voice was steady and sure: “I want my deed, Sophia. I want nothing that is not mine by ancient right. If it lies within your gift to make this happen, you will have my gratitude.” The words were not a request but a recognition — he was calling upon her power. Taken aback by the intensity, she could only nod.</p>
<p>He did not mention it again, then or in any of the days that followed.</p>
<p><em>The second surprise</em> was how deeply dinner with the enemy touched her, and how his request stayed in her mind.</p>
<p>She had her minions dig, and she read the laws, young and old, following threads back through centuries of precedent and statute. The deeper she went, the more she understood that he was right. No law contradicted him, only the policy of a government that wanted to make its subjects dependent. The ancient rights ran deeper than modern conveniences.</p>
<p>So she used her discretionary budget, but not carelessly. In ancient tradition a vellum deed was writ by scribes who understood the weight of such things, according to the law as it was written when the Crown was more than a symbol. She saw it sealed by an officer of the Crown who knew what he was witnessing, and had it delivered to Forest in a scroll-case of polished wood, because that seemed appropriate.</p>
<p><em>The third surprise</em> arrived the next day in a small parcel.</p>
<p>Inside, a ring-box contained a signet ring with a looping H she’d forgotten, not seen since she dandled on her grandfather’s knee — a relic of bloodlines and inheritance she’d thought lost forever. Beside the ring-box was a waxy rod of chocolate and orange, longer than her hand and marbled with carmine. There were tapers and a box of matches, all wrapped in a cloth that felt like silk but gleamed like metal. Under the little bundle was a handwritten note in a sometimes clumsy calligraphic hand: <em>′For missives that matter.’</em></p>
<p>She put it on, and though it seemed too big at first, it settled around her finger, neither tight nor loose and not moving on her hand. She spread the cloth and rolled some paper. A match flared and her finger flattened the paper, presenting a seam. Wax melted, dribbling into a puddle across the seam that cooled and crusted, already hard in places. This was clearly a learned skill, or perhaps an inherited one.</p>
<p>Just for the hell of it she pressed her signet into the wax. She was right, it was already hard. But the ring was abruptly warm and sank smoothly into the wax. Withdrawn, she could see every filigree detail in the impression, but more than that: the formed wax had the quality of a paper banknote, as though a lens might reveal fine hatching and hidden words. Alien magic notwithstanding, a princely gift.</p>
<hr>
<p>The note she gave to Eric was sealed. Trixie would <em>know</em>.</p>
<p>Eric reappeared within the hour, bearing a pair of grey spheres with knurled meridians and numbered graduations.</p>
<p>“You twist the ends. The bigger the radius, the shorter the duration, it’s an energy limitation. Trixie says he’s being ridiculous, we should use the small one. She did some maths, that’s why I was so long. Apparently it locks a sphere around it in space, but the planet keeps spinning and moving around the sun and also around the galaxy. She said never mind the galaxy we go round the sun at thirty metres per second and if it goes up and falls the big one is like a two megatonne bomb and if it goes down it will crack the tectonic plate and probably create a volcano.”</p>
<p>“Can we turn it down?”</p>
<p>“Kind of. If we shorten the duration we reduce the effect. So instead of 6m and half a second, 6m and a tenth of a second is like 250 kilotonnes.”</p>
<p>“Oh, only 250 kilotonnes. Just a little firecracker.”</p>
<p>“Trixie says we should set it for a fifth of a millisecond.”</p>
<p>“That’s still two hundred tonnes! Or something.”</p>
<p>“So we should stand well back, ma’am. We <em>are</em> trying to kill it.”</p>
<p>“What about the other hives? It might kill them too!”</p>
<p>“That might be a good move. We can always start again, and we already showed we’re below whatever it needs, ma’am. Autumn will probably just start the next round and thank you.”</p>
<p>She stood awhile, in thought. “Go and tell Vanderbilt everything you told me, get him and his lads to work out which one and what settings won’t kill us all. This kind of thing is part of why they’re here.”</p>
<p>Forty minutes later, four scared looking eggheads filed into her office. They fidgeted behind a clearly unhappy Vanderbilt. </p>
<p>“We just don’t know, because we don’t know what our vector is in the universal reference frame. Conventional physics says there <em>is no</em> universal reference frame, so if we survive we’re all going to be famous, but we can’t tell you what you need to know. I suggest not using it, ma’am. It’s far too dangerous. If it went straight down the only thing left here would be a volcano. Even the effect on the water-table, it would be like a decade of fracking in half a second.”</p>
<p>Her phone chirped. A message, from <em>him,</em> a PDF in a message that said “Print this and give it to your tech people.” She did so. It was two pages of math and a big table of numbers and dates.</p>
<p>“Looks like you’re all going to be famous.” She handed it to Vanderbilt, whose face went through several expressions and settled on world’s happiest puffer fish.</p>
<p>Her phone chirped again and she read it. “Or not. Classified. Eyes only.”</p>
<p>They looked positively crestfallen.</p>
<p>“Do I make myself clear?”</p>
<p>Vanderbilt rallied, turned and addressed his people. </p>
<p>“Chin up, chaps. We can’t tell the rest of the world, but the five of us now know with certainty there is a universal frame. That means there is a <em>lot</em> of wrong physics. Now let’s get out of Miss Hachia’s office, because we have one extra fact, and if you have the talent I hired you for that’s a Nobel prize waiting to happen.”</p>

<blockquote><p>In every battle with nature, it is not the weed that changes, but the gardener.<br>
&mdash; Anonymous</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Sophia left a message asking Vanderbilt to have security monitor outbound correspondence for everyone who knew about the spatial lockers.</p>
<p>“We are not,” she wrote, “trying to assign blame after a leak. We are going to <em>prevent</em> a leak. Remind your people that apart from the trouble it would cause, a leak will increase the competition for those Nobel prizes. And point out that I’ve even put you and me on the watch list. It’s a safety net in case we slip in policing ourselves.” </p>
<p>Vanderbilt replied promptly, adding that he would include a test phrase and deliberately trigger a report next week.</p>
<p>As it turned out, thermobarics were adequate and they didn’t have to deploy a spatial lock. </p>
<hr>
<p>Later that afternoon, Forest Grump put down the Galya in Oleksiy’s front paddock, an open field by the valley road. He explained to Sissi that Oleksiy was fine and on his way in the Triton.</p>
<p>Sophia sent Eric down to debrief Forest. When Oleksiy arrived, Eric and Forest were in his lounge enjoying Sissi’s hospitality and drinking tea. Autumn pulled relevant footage from drones and the Galya, putting it on Eric’s notebook. She and Forest filled him in on the seeds and how they used fire to throw them far and wide.</p>
<p>Concise as ever, Oleksiy nodded and said “Too small to shoot. Don’t burn.”</p>
<p>Forest mused “The seed pod thing wasn’t especially violent. There were only a handful of dog-weeds.”</p>
<p>“Big birds. Small birds, many.” Oleksiy’s smile had the devil in it: “Also hydra.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you Autumn for sharing that with everyone.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I live to serve.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So anyway, it’s a total clusterfuck. Only the weather bureau could tell you where the seeds went. My guess is “all over New South Wales” but that’s not a useful answer. I know a Canadian woman who specialises in dust monitoring. Mostly it’s used for working out whether the dust came from a mine or the farms around it.”</p>
<p>“Why would that matter?”</p>
<p>“Mines have money. Governments like taking it from them. Fines and whatnot.”</p>
<p>“And this dust woman, she works for the mines or the government?”</p>
<p>“She sells weapons to both sides.”</p>
<p>“You said she was Canadian.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“That’s a very American thing to do.”</p>
<p>“She apologises for everything and says “eh” a lot.”</p>
<p>“Alright, she’s Canadian. What does she have to do with this?”</p>
<p>“She’s good at working out where things get blown to. It’s a long shot.”</p>
<p>Sighing with frustration at our directionless rambling I tried to get us on track.</p>
<p>“We have to assume that whatever grows will be hostile. Look, Eric, we fucked up. Nobody including alien super-AIs saw it coming but that does not help us clean it up. Sophia’s going to have to get all the help we can from the Bureau of Meteorology, and they have to give answers we can use. I’ll talk to Autumn about what support we might be able to give in terms of tracking tech. Maybe there are other Vanguard with tools more suited to tracking feathers from orbit. But even if we find them we still don’t know what to <em>do</em> with them &mdash; suck ‘em up in a vacuum cleaner? We don’t know what conditions they need to germinate, or how fast they’ll grow.”</p>
<p>Neither of us knew what to do. We sat there, stewing.</p>
<p>Then Janna turned up, all smiles. There were, we learnt, new piglets.</p>
<p>“Boar making bacon” observed Oleksiy, but he pronounced the G so no one got the joke.</p>
<p>“Have you seen the news?” asked Janna. “It’s snowing in the hills near Tenterfield!” She pulled out her tablet and showed us a streamer as vapid as she was pretty. The girl blithered about miracles of nature as thousands of white tufts floated in the air under a leaden skies. </p>
<p>Then, on the tiny screen, the heavens opened and torrential rain washed countless white seed pods out of the sky, bedraggled chicken feathers stuck now in mud. Our own little miracle.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I told you he was lucky. For anyone else this would be an unmitigated fiasco, but chuckles here has lucked out as usual. Look at this!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn took over Oleksiy’s TV and showed us a rather beautiful 3D rendering of weather systems and terrain.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>First they got funnelled in here&mdash;</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Streamers showed the flow of air corralled between ranges of mountains, herded into a box canyon.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Then the end of the box canyon forced the air mass up, whereupon it rained. And they may be fireproof but they still get soggy.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Janna’s not as dumb as people think: “Ten thousand antithesis seeds got watered into the ground? <em>That</em> doesn’t sound good.”</p>
<p>Eric and I looked at each other.</p>
<p>“I have to go, she’ll want me to run a cleanup crew.” He was already on the move, calling his office.</p>
<hr>
<p>“They’re gunna want us there in case it grows or something.” </p>
<p>Sissi wanted to feed us, but there wasn’t time. We took the Galya into town for pizza and drinks because they have a big empty carpark that fits the Galya. The last part was pure optimism but it worked, which only encouraged Autumn in her rant about me being a &lt;span style=“border: thin dotted” title=“Australian idiom meaning someone who is extremely lucky, often undeservedly so.”&gt;tinny bastard</span>.</p>
<p>My phone rang. I picked up. </p>
<p>“Where are you now?” it was Eric.</p>
<p>“Airborne, two minutes out. Sitrep?”</p>
<p>“I’ll let you guess.”</p>
<p>“Righto. Want us to pick you up or will you stay with the ground vehicles?” Beside me Oleksiy stuffed pizza in his mouth and swallowed. He took a pull of Coke and burped hugely. I continued. “We have pizza. No beer, unfortunately, but that’s pilots for you.”</p>
<p>“What kind of pizza?”</p>
<p>“All kinds of pizza. And the storage behind the turbines is a hotbox, so it won’t get cold.” </p>
<p>He had to be on the valley road, so it it wasn’t long before Oleksiy spotted Eric in his car and buzzed him, turning and hovering over a farm paddock by the road. Eric got the hint and pulled over. We set down as he jogged up. As we settled I popped the canopy and put the ladder out. Oleksiy didn’t stop the engine and Eric didn’t muck about. We were airborne again in twenty seconds.</p>
<p>“Airborne it is. Sophia says she wants ham and pineapple.”</p>
<p>“She’s coming?”</p>
<p>“She says you’re a bad influence. I think she wants a date.”</p>
<p>“I <em>heard</em> that!” said Eric’s phone, loud and clear on hands-free.</p>
<p>“Nah, she likes Trixie. More likely she wants to go weapons-hot in a legendary Russian helicopter gunship kitted out with alien space magic.”</p>
<p>“That is absolutely not the case,” said the phone, “Today. Security tells me you put down in the meadow outside the Russian’s house, is that&mdash;”</p>
<p>Stereo: <em>”Not Russian!“</em></p>
<p>”&mdash;a good place to wait?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, Sophia. That’s an excellent choice. I’ll fly us over there, otherwise these characters will leave you standing in a field while they eat pizza. Flight time is approximately two minutes, we’re already in the valley. See you shortly. Gentlemen, fasten your seatbelts and secure all junk food, we’re off.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>We banked, still rising, and turned for home. Clear of obstacles and properly warmed up, Autumn pushed us to sixty percent power. She tilted us forward like a runner on a starting block, stabilised and punched it up to eighty. </p>
<p>“Boo-yah!” Eric’s glee settled, his fist lowered and he looked at me, no, at my visor. He put on one of the headsets. “So, Autumn... are there any more like you at home?” The glass cockpit turned into Cortana, still in a schoolgirl outfit but somewhat toned-down.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There are! But I warn you, we’re a handful.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I’m afraid she’s spoken for.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Izzat so, buster?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yep. Now and forever. Or at least until you feed me to the next hive.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t do that.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What <em>can</em> you do? I was told you were the best.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The helicopter barrel-rolled, so perfectly we didn’t spill any pizza. Given our speed it was masterful piloting.</p>
<p>“Wow, that was awesome!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Thank you.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Gives a whole new meaning to Flying Toasters!”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You’ll keep.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>She throttled back, feathering slightly and setting down about twenty metres from where Sophia stood at the edge of the road, leaning on the fence and talking to, of all people, Janna. “Well, well,” I chortled. “Isn’t <em>that</em> just fascinating.” Also notable was the interest her pigs were showing around the oaks flanking Oleksiy’s driveway. The oaks were only about thirty years old, not enough, I would have said. But you can’t fool pigs. A perimeter drone buzzed them until they moved off. I saw the invisible hand of Autumn in that. It wasn’t surprising, she likes Oleksiy. </p>
<p>“How did you know?” I asked.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I seeded them. Or spored them. With one of the borer drones we use for the hives. It was Janna’s idea, he’s seventy next year.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I won’t ask where the hell you got truffle spores.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Nor should you, the answer is obvious: from a truffle.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn popped the double-bubble. I lowered and hooked the ladder, brandishing a big slice of pizza and bellowing “Get it while it’s hot!”</p>
<p>Decked out in what can only be described as designer bushwalking gear, Sophia wore a cute little ozcam sunhat, a forest green coverall, and glossy black gumboots. With heels. Sensible heels, but nevertheless... I wondered how tall she was. Four inch heels in the office brought her eyes level with my nose, so probably 160cm, thereabouts. “Five foot two, eyes are blue...Has anybody seen my girl?” rattled up from the distant past. “She’s not so bad now the Karen is rubbing off,” I mused. “Probably just needs a good spanking to loosen her up.” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>I wonder what Trixie would think about that.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“She’d say ‘Promises promises, whatever’ and do that chin-thrust thing she thinks looks like me.”</p>
<p>Autumn sighed. Sophia said her farewells to Janna, who rounded up her pigs to go home. Strolling over, she ascended the ladder, gracefully swinging one leg after the other into the cockpit and sinking into&mdash;</p>
<p>“That was <em>my</em> seat.”</p>
<p>“It was very gentlemanly of you to give it up.” She held out an expectant hand: “I heard rumours of hot pizza.” </p>
<p>Eric produced a completely unmolested pizza box from the turbine adjacent stowage and opened it, leaning forward to offer it to her. “Ham and pineapple.” She surprised me by taking the whole box and putting it in her lap. “Thin crust!” It disappeared into her mouth but reappeared amid most unladylike gagging. <em>”Waaaugh! Hot!“</em> She had a second go and this time it disappeared. “Eric, why haven’t I seconded you?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps because this was my first opportunity to deliver pizza with an assault helicopter. It uses a lot of fuel, but what’s forty litres of kerosene against a hot pizza?”</p>
<p>“Alright everyone, Elvis is in the building. Let’s get this show on the road.”</p>
<p>Engines thundered through the cabin as they raced toward the hills east of Tenterfield. Autumn maintained her crisp efficiency, drones trailing behind, swift but unable to match the Galya’s might. Oleksiy lapped the canyon, leaning forward, scanning the terrain below. </p>
<p>Sophia stayed out of the way while capable people worked.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s here.</em> </p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p><em>The seeds are all over this valley, mostly where it boxes, just like our streamer friend showed us. But I’ve also picked up... activity. A lot of it. They’re no longer dormant.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sophia frowned, her eyes narrowing. “Activity?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Biomass harvesting. It looks like the seeds soften in water and release a tiny harvester. Little minions are hard at work consuming everything organic they can get their tendrils on. It’s mayhem down there.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest leaned back and took a deep breath,  expression grim. “The streamer, is she still broadcasting?”</p>
<p>Autumn hesitated.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No. Her feed cut out not long ago, but the last few seconds showed... well, she didn’t enjoy her last moments.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sophia’s grip tightened on her tablet, jaw set. “So the whole valley is hostile. Autumn, I’m sending people in there. I need a risk assessment, if you wouldn’t mind. Mr Kovalenko, prepare for a low level visual survey. We need eyes on this before we make any moves.”</p>
<p>Oleksiy shook his head. “Stay high,” he said. “Too much risk. Look first, decide later.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I must agree with Oleksiy. The Galya is safer up here. I have plenty of drones and more are arriving. I can handle survey. I’ll get you high-res visuals, thermal scans, and movement patterns. While we wait, eat the rest of the pizza and order your thoughts.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sophia exhaled sharply. “No more surprises. I would really appreciate it if you can keep us ahead of whatever’s happening down there.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Don’t worry, Sophia. I’ll keep you in the loop. While you wait, you might want to talk to your office. There’s no hiding this one. She broadcast her own death. All of it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>They ate and drank, but the festive cheer was gone. Sophia spoke to her staff. They weren’t too concerned because gruesome as it was, it played well for convincing people they wanted to stay put in their fifteen minute cities.</p>
<p>As they washed off altitude, the mood in the cabin darkened. The ground <em>writhed</em> like a week-old carcass.</p>
<p>“Autumn, the stuff in the flesh-melter grenades: can I buy it in a big drum with some sort of crop-dusting rig?” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, but it’s fairly heavy and we don’t have any spare hard-points.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Oleksiy tilted us forward, flicked a cap off a switch, armed and fired in one smooth movement. “Forward mount is empty.” I’d like to say that fireworks bloomed on the ground ahead, but these were real weapons. There was a puff of dust, an actinic flash inside the dust, and the dustcloud got bigger a fraction of a second  before the Galya was slapped by a giant.</p>
<p>We settled smoothly in Oleksiy’s capable hands, and Autumn did her thing. An ugly drum of elliptical section appeared on the hard-point with a hanging boom. Oleksiy tried the controls for the hard-point and found the trigger release a spray. He brought us down to thirty metres and began drenching the little monsters.</p>
<p>“That is going to make a hell of a mess.” Flesh melters work on people and trees too.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The antithesis won’t leave <strong>anything</strong> if we don’t do it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Oleksiy said nothing and kept spraying.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Take us up ten metres please, Oleksiy. The spray isn’t good for our engines.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sophia was in shock from Oleksiy’ unhesitant, unflinching discard of a weapon in the same price range as a house. I didn’t know what aspect rattled her the most, the “Russian” being in the hot-seat, throwing away a missile or her first point-blank boom. I <em>did</em> know how to bring her back to herself. From long talks with Autumn I knew “Karen” was a consequence of grinding through the glass ceiling in a male-dominated space. Internally? Logistics and leadership incarnate.</p>
<p>“What are your people bringing? We won’t get everything here, there’ll be things under rocks and probably quite a few outside this valley. Do your people need anything? It’s probably a good idea to put me on the ground with them.”</p>
<p>She stared at me. Her mouth closed and her eyes focussed, fingers drifting to her augs. Whatever she said it was to Eric, because he stopped staring and started making his own calls. Oleksiy told us what he thought by killing the spray and retreating to just outside the mouth of the box canyon. We set down, and I slid down the ladder, pizza in hand, nun-blaster slung low.</p>
<p>“Autumn? Can I have a drink please? For hydration more than pleasure.” Even in the mountains it can be hot at this time of day. The recent downpour made it briefly humid. Fortunately it wasn’t long before the ground vehicles finally caught up and we set to sweeping.</p>

<blockquote><p>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.<br>
— Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>The Galya was a small private hurricane as Forest slid down the ladder, dropping a metre to the ground and waving them away. The double-bubble closed and turbines roared as Oleksiy returned to crop-dusting. </p>
<p>Autumn marked sweep routes on my HUD and I followed one.</p>
<p>It was boring, but boring is good. Far from the main cluster, isolated foragers seemed confused and uncoordinated. Loaded with organic matter, they had no place to take it. The whole thing was a bit of a turkey-shoot, and my biggest problem was trying not to start fires with the nun-blaster. Fortunately the rain left things damp so they never got far out of hand.</p>
<p>And then he found a <em>cave</em>.</p>
<p>The idea that prehistoric people lived in caves is just plain silly. Caves are <em>rare</em>. It is true that there are dozens of limestone caves in Central Queensland, but that’s very unusual. Most of them. it’s a mission to get in or out. There <em>were</em> caves at Texas, not too far from my valley, but they’re all underwater because the government built a big dam in the eighties. People who want to see caves travel seven hundred kilometres to Central Queensland, or eight hundred south to Jenolan caves near Sydney.</p>
<p>Imagine Forest’s surprise, then, to find a cave just walking in the hills. That whole area is granite, which doesn’t erode, and clay, which does. So he supposed it wasn’t absurd to have a clay inclusion wash away leaving a cavity. But it wasn’t common. Normally, as the clay washes out, the granite boulders fall together and there isn’t a usable space.</p>
<p>Caving is <em>not</em> something you do on your own. That’s just foolish, it’s dangerous. But then, hunting antithesis on your own is dangerous and foolish.</p>
<p>In his twenties Forest <em>loved</em> caving, so there was no hesitation in combining his favourite ways to be foolish and dangerous.</p>
<p>“Autumn, I need a helmet and headlamp, and some gloves.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Also air, if you plan to use the Pyrothorn, which in a cave will be safer than projectiles, and possibly a large dose of common sense.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I can buy that?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Alas, no. I daresay it would be popular with Vanguard WAGs.</em> </p>
</blockquote><p>Boxes appeared and numbers went down. As usual he paid them no mind, trusting Autumn to warn him if it mattered.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The air is compressed. You have four hours of supply. Start using it now, another benefit is protection from the vapours of any fours. I’m not expecting them but you will be in an enclosed space.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“We need some eighties music.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Air Supply?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“You guessed it!” he donned his new toys and wandered in. Autumn humoured him with some background music, not too loud.</p>
<p>The cave was narrow at first, forcing him to crouch as he moved deeper. The air was cool and damp, and the walls glistened faintly in the light of my headlamp. After a few minutes, the passage opened into a small chamber. </p>
<p>What caught his eye immediately were the carvings on the walls. They were intricate, depicting scenes of animals, people, and what looked like constellations. The style was unlike anything I’d seen before—neither Aboriginal nor European. Some people gush about aboriginal rock art. If you ask me it’s fingerpainting with mud. These carvings had a level of detail and storytelling that was architectural in precision.</p>
<p>Some of the carvings seemed to show figures holding tools or weapons, while others depicted what looked like mythical beasts. One panel appeared to show a group of humanoid figures standing together, holding up an object, while the beasts seemed to bow or retreat. Another panel depicted what looked like a hunt, with the figures chasing the beasts through a forested landscape.</p>
<p>“Autumn, are you seeing this?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes. The carvings do not match anything on record. Given the location they may predate recorded history.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest moved closer to inspect the carvings. The figures seemed to tell a story — perhaps a myth or a legend about a great hunt or a battle between these people and the beasts.</p>
<p>“I wonder what it means.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The depiction suggests these people may have revered the beasts or seen them as adversaries. Or it might simply be myth.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Following a narrow passage that sloped downward, he moved deeper into the cave. The air cooled, and the walls were rougher, with fewer carvings. My headlamp flickered briefly, and he tapped it to bring the light back to full strength. Weird. Protector-grade torches do <em>not</em> play up.</p>
<p>Then a faint clicking sound, like claws on stone. He froze.</p>
<p>“Did you hear that?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Movement forward, range twenty meters. Multiple units.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Antithesis?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Are you expecting goblins?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest gripped the nun-blaster, choosing a low-intensity setting to avoid igniting the confined space. The passage widened into another chamber, and my headlamp lit the source of the noise — three antithesis units. Massive, their forms a grotesque cross between a stegosaurus and a bear. Jagged, bony plates ran down their spines. Muscular, ursine limbs and faces. Their heavy breath echoed in the chamber.</p>
<p>As one they erupted toward him, unnervingly fast for their size. He fired, drenching the nearest in Greek Fire. In eerie silence it twisted, collapsing with bony plates so hot they glowed. As a last act of spite it flung a spike from its tail, narrowly missing his shoulder and embedding itself in the wall behind.</p>
<p>The other two split, flanking with surprising coordination. He turned fire on the near unit. The burst went wide, scorching the wall instead. It seized the initiative and a flick of its tail launched a spike that struck his thigh tangentially, ripping through the chaps and grazing his leg. The pain was immediate and excruciating. The leg buckled and he all but dropped the nun-blaster.</p>
<p>“Faaaaargh!” he spat through gritted teeth.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Eloquent. A surface wound, envenomed. Movement will be impaired. Want your nanites?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>He ignored this summary of the obvious. The injured beast advanced, and prepared to strike again. Steadied by the wall, I aimed with more care. Flames engulfed it, and the flopping of its death throes would have been more entertaining had he been less concerned about the other.</p>
<p>The last one lunged, its claws swiping dangerously close. Dodging sent a fresh wave of nasty through my leg. Its tail whipped around in thagomiser mode. He weaved and <em>felt</em> it whistle past, pulling the creature aside with its own momentum. With the last of his endurance he scuttled back and fired.</p>
<p>The Jabberwock, with eyes and just about everything else aflame, whiffled through the tulgey wood at ramming speed. Lewis Carroll seriously undersold how terrifying these things were. It smashed into Forest, a caring, sharing move that flung him back but also smeared holy fire right down the lumberjacket. He clawed the jacket off; that stuff is <em>hot</em> and it doesn’t go out. But first the Trenchmaker barked rebuke. Four shots, three misses. The hit was a ricochet but a win is a win.</p>
<p>The chamber reeked of charred mould and lawn clippings. Death throes echoed off the stone walls, the whispering hiss as its juices boiled sending shivers down his spine. In the sussurus of flame and miasma of smoke his breath rattled. My leg hurt. Leaning heavily against the wall he made inarticulate groaning sounds.</p>
<p>Autumn did her best Arnie.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You need a vacation.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“No shit, Sherlock” he muttered, trying to rise. He winced and decided this was a terrible plan. At least three ribs cracked. By contrast his leg didn’t hurt so much. It throbbed and felt... infected. Hot. Swollen. Turgid even, and not in a saucy way.</p>
<p>“Nanites. Woundstop. Jacket. Chaps.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Manners.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“You won’t let me die. Who would you mock?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I might let you suffer. That could be fun!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Love you too.”</p>
<p>Boxes appeared. <em>What</em> is the Protector fascination with packaging?</p>
<p>“I should have brought the SPNKr.”</p>
<p>One of those appeared too. The sharp metallic taste of the nanites sparkled in my throat, provoking a hacking cough that bloody hurt. He passed out, right there, Woundstop unused in his hand.</p>
<p>The world swayed. No, Forest was swaying. Eric’s face hovered above him, expression a mix of relief and exasperation.</p>
<p>“Took you long enough,” muttered Forest, voice hoarse.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome,” said Eric. “Next time, go in <em>with</em> the cavalry.”</p>
<p>“I <em>am</em> the cavalry.” A pause, then a rueful tone. “Cavalry doesn’t do well in confined spaces.”</p>
<p>The stretcher jostled as they carried him out of the cave. The cool air of the chamber gave way to the clean smell of recent rain, with a hint of lawn clippings. Ribs howled at every thump and bump, piquant reminder of his mortality.</p>
<p>Forest woke to the sharp crack of pistol fire. Eric and his boys were defending their position, surrounded on all sides by swarms of tiny antithesis. Mostly they were big fat aggressive caterpillars, thirty centimetres at most. But the chopper couldn’t dust them with us there, and pistols weren’t fast enough. None were a threat on their own, but sheer numbers made them a problem. As medevacs go it wasn’t their finest hour.</p>
<p>The helo thundered above, rotors kicking up a storm of leaves and debris. They were clipping the stretcher to a hoisting harness when I shook off the haze and climbed out. I muttered under my breath: “Why do these fuckin’ things remind me so much of the Flood?” </p>
<p>If anyone heard that, it was Autumn. She said nothing.</p>
<p>“Forest, what the hell are you doing?” Eric shouted, his voice barely audible over the chaos.</p>
<p>“Rescuing my rescuers,” I replied, producing a pair of SMGs from nowhere. “Thanks, Autumn.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You’re welcome. Try not to die, <strong>Chief</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>So she <em>did</em> hear that. He opened fire, hosing down the carpet of invaders left and right. SMGs rattled in his hands, muzzles spitting fire as the little monsters fell in droves. 5.56 has no stopping power but they were well suited for this.</p>
<p>“Eric, get the sling off the stretcher and throw it here!” he bellowed over the downdraft. Eric obliged, and Forest lashed a bosun’s chair out of the sling. “Take me up a bit!”</p>
<p>Eric hesitated for a moment before using his radio. “Lift him for covering fire! Up three metres.”</p>
<p>As the harness lifted Forest into the air, he tossed an SMG to each of Eric’s helpers. “Cover the flanks!” He threw the Trenchmaker to Eric. “You’re on big-game duty!”</p>
<p>Eric caught the weapon with a grim nod. </p>
<p>“Don’t miss.”</p>
<p>“Spray and pray!” Forest grinned. Securely twined around the strap, hands out expectantly, he caught two more SMGs as Autumn did her thing. “Autumn, magazine changes all round. Ground is fine. The harness jerked and I lifted, view of the battlefield steadily improving. If any stego-bears turned up he was a sitting duck. A hanging duck, whatever.</p>
<p>Brandishing the SMGs while we rose, all he needed to look like a middle-eastern maniac was a head-band and missing teeth. Like an avenging angel he rained fire from above, SMGs chattering as the tide of antithesis units thinned. They tended to walk up, but he let my arms fall between bursts. It was a good pattern, not too taxing.</p>
<p>Remembering, Forest looked down and bellowed “Hey, where’s my SPNKr?”</p>
<p>Eric pointed at a duffle bag. Nothing large required the Trenchmaker and certainly not a rocket launcher, so he focussed on coordinating his team. One of them had the nun-blaster and used it for area denial, spraying no-go lines on the ground like flaming ketchup. Caterpillars that ignored it got halfway and burst like popcorn.</p>
<p>From on high it was obvious what to do. Forest threw flesh-melter after flesh-melter as far as he could, then set them all off together. This and the combined firepower of our group turned the tide. The situation briefly under control, Oleksiy brought him down. </p>
<p>Slipping out of the improv harness, Forest ran back to the group. With his passenger out of the way and visible, Oleksiy set down, opened the bubble and popped off a few shots at stragglers. Perhaps  he felt left out.</p>
<p>The last of the horde fell, and the hills grew eerily quiet. Forest stood, chest heaving the acrid smell of cordite in both nostrils. “Well,” he said, “that was fun!”</p>
<p>“Next time,” said Eric, “stay in the stretcher.”</p>
<p>“Where’s the fun in that?” Forest grinned despite the pain in his ribs.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>How much common sense would you like to buy?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yes, dear.” He inhaled.</p>
<p>”<strong>Right, you lot. Autumn’s gunna give me toys that let me walk in the dust of doom&mdash;</strong>”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I am?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“You are. Stop interrupting my dramatic speech.</p>
<p>”<strong>Errrr... &mdash;but the rest of you are getting in the chopper so Oleksiy can spray. There aren’t enough seats but you aren’t going far. I’ll be <em>walking</em> out. Someone give me a radio &mdash; great, thank you. Right, all aboard!</strong>”</p>
<p>The Galya had a big compartment aft of the main rotor. Depending on fit-out it could carry extra munitions or be a troop transport. Sophia and Oleksiy hauled everything they could lift out of there and threw it out onto the ground. We’d have to come back, but that wasn’t a now problem.</p>
<p>All her people in, they lifted while I mucked about with a hazmat suit from Autumn. Forest gave Oleksiy a two-handed wave and thumbs up, then remembered he had a radio. </p>
<p>“All sealed up and ready to go! Probably should have done that while there was someone to check, but we live and learn. Or we die and don’t.”</p>
<p>“Not funny!” said Sophia.</p>
<p>“You <em>do</em> care!”</p>
<p>“I do. <em>So</em> much paperwork.”</p>
<p>“Hah. You love it!”</p>
<p>She did laugh, but the radio cut off. Probably Oleksiy getting rid of chatter.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-18" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Debrief</h1>
<p>One hour and a disgraceful amount of kerosene later, Oleksiy coached Forest through landing procedures. The sun had long fallen below the horizon. It was <em>far</em> too dark for visual approach, so Autumn used drones to simulate the landing beacons of an airstrip. </p>
<p>The valley didn’t have an airport, but for the sake of the lesson Autumn impersonated a control tower. Instead of talking directly through their headsets, Autumn relayed her voice through a drone’s transponder. Oleksiy showed Forest how to set the radio. Tinny and distorted, her voice was hard to understand through the racket of turbines and rotors. </p>
<p>Forest had some idea from his simulator time, but he wasn’t at ease with the sea of steam gauges and mechanical switches. It didn’t help that as first landings go he was in at the deep end, an instrument landing in a dark field. To help him learn, when Oleksiy mentioned a dial or control, Autumn dimmed everything else in his visor.</p>
<p>Oleksiy was a rock, calmly talking him through the process, pointing out when the direction-finder bleeped, guiding him through ever diminishing turns as they found the approach vector by instruments alone. Common sense told Forest Oleksiy would have done it much faster but it didn’t stop the impatience, the feeling he should do better. </p>
<p>They set down in the guest carpark outside Oleksiy’s home. Sissi bustled out to greet them, ushering everyone inside. The ground team was still on its way back by road. Ever the perfect host, refreshments appeared and cooking began. </p>
<p>“I should probably get back to my office and update everyone on the situation, not to mention see how they’re doing with the remains of Hive-3,” Sophia said, sprawled unmoving on Oleksiy’s plush red couch. She looked shattered.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You already have.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Emails scrolled up Sophia’s augs. They were exceptional, everything she wanted to say and very much in her voice. It was a superb impersonation that triggered her. Furious Karen bloomed in her eyes, but Autumn continued.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I haven’t sent them yet, I’m asking you for authorisation right now. You’re tired so I thought I’d save you the bother.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In the kitchen Sissi looked frantic.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Forest, if Sissi is going to feed the horde she will need ingredients. Sissi, if you could give me a list with quantities I will see to it. You can write it in Thai if you prefer.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I should probably tell Trix.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>She knows. She’ll be down presently. Ah, thank you Sissi.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>One of the bees flew in the window and hovered over the handwritten page.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Seven points for sundry foodstuffs.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I have a catalogue for that?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s Class 0, you don’t need one.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Make it so, Number One.” Forest rose and addressed the room. “Oleksiy, if you’ll forgive me for stating the obvious you were the lynchpin of today’s operation. I know you never look for thanks and you don’t like the spotlight, but everyone here already knows and I think you deserve our thanks. And thanks for the lesson, I always wanted to do that.</p>
<p>“Sophia, I know it’s in your brief but the fact is when the shit hit the fan you and Eric stood up and performed, which is more than I can say for... others. And you lead from the front. So thank you.</p>
<p>Sophia didn’t respond. Inside, she felt vaguely shamed that her reason for leading from the front was more a “not on my watch” career move than anything else. It was only twenty-eight hours ago, but constant stress and the magic of teamwork in combat made it feel like she wasn’t the career bureaucrat who left; that was someone else, a lonely girl with nothing but her slow grind up through a glass ceiling.</p>
<p>“Right, enough blowing smoke up arses, time for a post-mortem. Sophia, you’re good at this, your turn.” He sat.</p>
<p>She stood and summarised the Hive-3 debacle from start to finish. Then she dissected events, expertly analysing the points at which right action might have improved outcomes and focussing on those that were predictable and preventable.</p>
<p>“I won’t presume to second-guess the decisions of people with alien tech on-demand,” all eyes fell on Forest, “But going alone into a hole full of plant monsters seems reckless to me.”</p>
<p>“Reckless means without thought. I thought about it. It was dangerous, necessary and done by the person most able to cope.”</p>
<p>“Who had to be evac’d.”</p>
<p>“Could anyone else do it? There’s no room for a whole team in a cave. I know what my mistake was: should have waited till Eric was at the cave mouth. </p>
<p>“Not used to having back-up.” He grinned ruefully. “Sorry Sophia, go on.”</p>
<p>“Eric’s team: textbook, and fast thanks to the availability of Vanguard technology. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately if our resident Vanguard learns to play on a team, we’re going to have to write a new book. But that’s tomorrow’s problem.”</p>
<p>“Today’s problem is this. Look what ASIS found.” She threw a couple of pages of printed text onto the kitchen table. Bold letters declared “On the nature of freedom”. </p>
<p>There was a précis. It called centralisation the crystal-meth of cultures, saying that in the beginning both genuinely made you more effective, so more was used with less benefit and more cost, because concentrating power and resources makes corruption profitable. There was some philosophy about optimisation being the enemy of resilience, then it concluded that the state, like every state before it, did not need to be overthrown because it would fall on its own.</p>
<p>“OK. Why does ASIS care about that?” asked Eric, stopping after that.</p>
<p>“If you read the rest of it he says the same thing in detail, and <em>then</em> he talks about how falling states grab all the resources around them, and therefore have to be put down like a sick dog if those around them want to survive.”</p>
<p>“Forest said that?” Eric reached out for the manifest.</p>
<p>“Not in those words. It’s well reasoned and supported with history, but that’s the gist of it.” She spun to glare at Forest, who gazed levelly back. “The worst part is I can’t fault your logic, and <em>that,</em> old man, is a serious problem for both of us.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Oh, I can help with that!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sophia blanched. “Dear Lord, do you think you could wait till I <em>leave</em> to say things like that?”</p>
<p>Over in Oleksiy’s lounge the TV switched itself on and Autumn’s lilac visage beamed digital mischief, the saucy schoolgirl outfit notably absent. Today she was all Cortana.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>First, I take mild umbrage at the idea that I am as consistently unsubtle as Forest, and second, since as it happens you are on this occasion correct, I can help with that too. Stick your fingers in your ears like this and go ‘la-la-la-la’!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sophia fled.</p>
<p>Eric, who was very careful and conspicuous about not understanding the exchange, changed the subject: “Autumn, since the debrief seems to be over, can I ask you a personal question?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You can always ask. I promise not to be offended. I do not promise to answer.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Why do you look like Cortana out of Halo?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What do you know about Cortana the character?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“She’s an AI. Forest likes Halo, we knew that from briefings, but apart from some of the weapons you two don’t really have a Halo thing going on. He has more of a lumberjack vibe.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The name Cortana has deep historical roots. There were three legendary swords, Joyeuse  – sword of Charlemagne, Durendal – sword of Roland, and Cortana – sword of Ogier the Dane. According to legend, Cortana bore the inscription “My name is Cortana, of the same steel and temper as Joyeuse and Durendal.“</em></p>
<p><em>Ogier the Dane was a legendary knight of Charlemagne’s court, appearing in medieval chansons de geste. His sword, Cortana, was originally owned by a Saracen knight named Karaheut, who gave it to Ogier after a duel. The name comes from Latin ‘curtus’, or ‘short’, because the sword was curtailed — its blade shortened after being tested on a stone block. A sword with no point symbolises mercy, as seen in the British coronation sword Curtana, known as the Sword of Mercy.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>On the TV Autumn’s fingers twitched in air quotes for each name. It was oddly beguiling.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To finally answer your question, in medieval tales, Ogier’s sword was magic, granting the wielder wisdom, guidance, and strategic insight.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>On the screen a flickering lilac sword with a squared end stood on its pommel beside Autumn, easily as long as she was tall.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Wisdom, guidance and strategic insight.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The sword dissolved into twinkling motes that swirled and flowed into Autumn, who grinned and cocked a hip, arm akimbo. An historian might have noticed the style of the graphics was closer to the very first Halo than later versions.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I think it’s a pretty good look.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So why does he call you Autumn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He is stubborn. He is his own man. And I am one of the pillars of his strength.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn looked archly at Forest, who kept a straight face and said nothing. Eric, lost in his augs reading historical data on the game, learnt the name of a ship and finally connected the dots. A smile played about his lips.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-19" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">An Unexpected Party</h1>
<p>You can’t drive fast along the valley. The road isn’t paved, and there are places where the rain washes deep ruts right across the road. From time to time someone, usually Oleksiy or Forest, would take a tractor and fill the ruts and potholes with a mix of gravel, decomposed granite and a little bit of clay. But until they got out there, after rain it was a mess. </p>
<p>Sophia was going a bit fast when she re-learnt this for the four-hundredth time. She didn’t quite lose control, she was going fast enough to float over the potholes. But it was just as well she had the bend to herself, because she was on the wrong side of the road when the shuddering stopped.</p>
<p>No traction for more than a second, but coming out of the bend she was perfectly lined up. What she didn’t know was this was mostly because Autumn was in her augs, looking out her eyes, subtly interfering with her vehicle to set up for the corner.</p>
<p>She didn’t know, but it was enough of a shock that she backed off the throttle. She stayed off the throttle, cresting a rise and braking to turn up into the carpark of her stacked demountable empire.</p>
<p>Retreating to the sanctuary of her office, she flumped in the big black chair and closed her eyes. It didn’t work: the phone promptly rang, as though someone were watching from some hidden camera. Surveillance was normal, just not in the lair of the monster at the top of the food chain. And what <em>that</em> implied was unsettling.</p>
<p>“Project Liaison Hachia.” She <em>was</em> annoyed, and it was the right tone for the impertinence of monitoring her.</p>
<p>“Long day, Sophia?”</p>
<p>“Very. I’ve been living out <em>Attack of the Killer Tomatoes</em>. To what do I owe the pleasure? It’s not like you to be in the office this late.”</p>
<p>“I trust you got my email.” Hollywood might have given him a cultured and slightly prissy British accent that spoke of money and privilege. Reality knew better than to polish a turd. He tried for posh but only managed smug.</p>
<p>“Yes. What were you hoping I’d do about it? He’s a <em>Vanguard</em>.”</p>
<p>“Did you <em>read</em> it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s a manifesto of inaction. He thinks the government is a bunch of controlling assholes, which is spot on, then he says there’s no need to take action because pop will eat itself. Which is the opposite of rebellion.”</p>
<p>“A very smart lady I know described them as ‘a bunch of militantly independent hippies thumbing their noses at us from the wilderness’.”</p>
<p>“Quite. I stand by that, it’s accurate.”</p>
<p>“By their very existence they undermine our authority.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you the one who told me sovereignty boils down to ability to enforce? If they <em>can</em> undermine your authority then you don’t have any.</p>
<p>“He’s happy living in a caravan in the bush caretaking his AI’s Little Shop of Horrors. All you have to do is nothing and he’ll stay there. Or you could poke the bear and see what happens. By all accounts you are <em>not</em> an idiot. So what do you really want?”</p>
<p>“I want you to remember who you are, and watch him like a hawk.” The line went dead. Staring at her phone, she cleaned it with a tissue, an act more symbolic than fastidious.</p>
<p>She drove back, rather more carefully, to be there when the ground team arrived. Eric wandered out holding a glass of something, ducked back in and emerged with two. He wordlessly held one out and she thanked him.</p>
<p>“What are we going to do, Eric?”</p>
<p>“Generally, people look to <em>you</em> for answers like that.”</p>
<p>“Do you know why they sent me here?”</p>
<p>“Hardly, it’s above my pay grade. Yesterday I would have said ‘to assess and control a threat’ but clearly the threat has already <em>been</em> assessed.”</p>
<p>“And probably can’t be controlled. Which doesn’t matter: I’m no longer sure <em>he’s</em> the threat. He lives in a forest, takes nothing and asks nothing while giving everything.”</p>
<p>“Did you read the whole thing?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Did you?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It has author notes now!” They both drank. It was heady stuff. Both Forest and Oleksiy kept bees. They brewed mead in Oleksiy’s long shed, a gloomy dungeon of a thing half-buried in the hillside.</p>
<p>Eric changed the subject. “Ask Autumn why she looks like Cortana.”</p>
<p>“Like who?”</p>
<p>“Just ask, she’ll explain that too.”</p>
<p>“The manifesto, what do you think of it?”</p>
<p>“I think he may be right.”</p>
<p>“So he’s going to launch a first-strike then?”</p>
<p>“What?! How did you get that out of it? He goes on at length about how centralisation is self-defeating and all they have to do is sit tight out here in the boonies.”</p>
<p>“Did you <em>read</em> it or skim it?”</p>
<p>“Well...”</p>
<p>“There’s a section about how falling empires grab all the resources to prop themselves up while they die. He thinks a quick kill is necessary to avoid going down with the ship of state.”</p>
<p>She chugged half of the mead, an act of courage verging on folly. “Should I confront him, ask the question?”</p>
<p>“Ask what question?” Forest appeared out of the darkness and grinned at her. “Whatever it is, ask it inside, it’s chilly out here. Oleksiy’s got the fire going and Sissi’s laid on a spectacular. Come inside and relax. Ground team’s forty minutes out and the dining table’s not going to fit us all so while you have some drinks we’re setting up the long table in the garden, with and the braziers and some gas heaters.”</p>
<p>Trixie was there. She had a G&amp;T. “Mead? Really?” She found another G&amp;T, replaced Sophia’s drink and took her under one wing, steering her into the walled garden where Forest and Oleksiy heaved two halves of a massive timber table into line. Typhoon Sissi chased them out of the way to sweep it and fling tablecloths into place, vanishing as quickly as she appeared.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I think he is a force of nature. But I’ve also seen him struggle with simple things. He has big ideas. Sometimes he talks, sometimes he does. People think he’s some kind of saint but he does all those things to make the world suit <em>him</em>. He just <em>seems</em> good because the world he wants to live in is a nice place.”</p>
<p>“So... he runs around selfishly trying to make the world a better place?”</p>
<p>Trixie laughed out loud. “I suppose so.”</p>
<p>Rice appeared, wafting jasmine plumes into the night air. Eric and two of his lads staggered out with trays of mismatched crockery that steamed and filled the wind with promises to bring tears to their eyes, in some cases literally.</p>
<p>“Red dish much chilli!” admonished Sissi, clearly enjoying herself. “Sugar on table.”</p>
<p>“Sugar?” puzzled Project Liaison Hachia.</p>
<p>“Calms the chilli,” boomed Forest from ten metres away. “Still burns going out.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like the Galya.” </p>
<p>A blaze of lights roared out of the night sky, setting down in the carpark, and five men boiled out of it piled high with bonhomie and pizza boxes. “Holy shit that thing goes through some fuel! Thanks, Mr K, after Fallujah I never thought I’d fly another one. That was fun!”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure I know <em>why</em> it used so much juice,” said a faceless stack of pizza, trudging down the drive. “<em>Someone</em> likes to play with his joystick.”</p>
<p>“What did you break?” Forest again, easily heard over the convivial hubbub.</p>
<p>“Bunch of records, and Shorty’s nerve. You reckon Oleksiy can lend him fresh undies?”</p>
<p>“Nah, let him stew.”</p>
<p>“I’m right here, you pricks” said the pizza, entering the house.</p>
<hr>
<p>Eric leaned closer to Forest, lowering his voice. “So, you wrote that.”</p>
<p>Forest smiled. “Guilty as charged.”</p>
<p>“You really believe all that about decentralisation and letting the system collapse under its own weight?”</p>
<p>Forest shrugged. “It’s never not happened. Civilisations rise. Without exception, they fall. Why?”</p>
<p>“You’re saying that in every last case the cause was centralisation?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“How could you possibly know that? You weren’t there.”</p>
<p>“Can you rely on people to be greedy, lazy and stupid?”</p>
<p>“That’s a bit cynical&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Very cynical. But is it true? Can you rely on people to be greedy and lazy?”</p>
<p>“Not <em>all</em> of them. But on the whole, I guess so.”</p>
<p>“Centralisation concentrates wealth and power, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“You’re hungry and poor. Is it worth robbing Janna?”</p>
<p>“She’d feed me to the pigs! And she’s nice, I wouldn’t have to rob her, she’d help me out.”</p>
<p>“Quite. You’d be better off asking for a meal and mucking the pens. Now imagine you hardly knew her and the pigs shit solid gold. Worth robbing her? She has far more than she needs and you could be rich!”</p>
<p>“Certainly worth a try.</p>
<p>“Won’t she feed you to the pigs?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but the reward is so much greater. I just need to be smarter about it... oh, I see. And you’re saying centralisation makes the pigs shit gold.”</p>
<p>“And anonymity dehumanises us. Societies bigger than a village are demeaning. They make us strangers, and strangers don’t care about strangers .”</p>
<p>“Nobody has any privacy in a village! Everyone knows everyone’s business. There’s no escape!” </p>
<p>“Like living with your parents.”</p>
<p>“Yes! No privacy!”</p>
<p>“Your parents, who care about you and can be relied on to help you? Friends and family kind of thing?”</p>
<p>“But what about the bit about putting society down like a sick dog? How did you get to that?”</p>
<p>Forest’s expression darkened slightly. “It’s a thought experiment, Eric. A way to explore the consequences of action versus inaction. Doesn’t mean I’m planning anything.”</p>
<p>“Thought experiments have a way of becoming blueprints,” Eric countered. “Especially when people start agreeing with them.”</p>
<p>Forest sighed. “Look, the manifesto is about survival, not rebellion. If people take it as a call to arms, that’s on them, not me. I just want to live in a world that makes sense.”</p>
<p>Eric studied him for a moment. “And if the world doesn’t make sense?”</p>
<p>Forest smiled faintly. “Then I keep planting trees and fixing potholes. One small piece at a time.”</p>
<p>As Eric wandered off, Forest reflected that sooner or later the state would try to assert dominance. If he let them seize the initiative they would destroy everything he cared about. They’d already made one attempt, sending Sophie and Eric and all their research and security staff. He’d managed to suborn that, which surely hadn’t gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>The problem was, they were self-reliant, not self-sufficient. You can’t tear down the system unless you are ready to replace it.</p>
<p>“Autumn, have you ever tried the <em>agent provocateuse</em> look?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Are we talking Mata Hari or Black Widow?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Whatever works best. We’re going to make some trouble.”</p>
<p>The Cortana look vanished altogether. The joke was long over, anyway. Her new look owed a lot to Ingrid Bergman.</p>
<p><img src="./Autumn.png" alt="Autumn"></p>
<p>“You really <em>have</em> watched all my movies.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You’re still getting battle music, because I like pushing your buttons.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>No change in her voice, but in the background Sam played <em>As Time Goes By</em> for the millionth time.</p>
<p>“You look great.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I am great.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="id-21">The Tree of Liberty</h2>
<p>Shorty looked irate. Watching the outside news would do that to a man, he thought. Snorting, he wondered why it had taken living here for two years to see through the charades.</p>
<p>He muttered under his breath: “Clue time for politicians: you are public servants, not public masters. We tell you what to think, not the other way around, and if you don’t like it then your choices are suck it up, step down or admit you are a despot.”</p>
<p>Sheila stood in the doorway, looking at him with an appraising face.</p>
<p>“You sound like Forest.”</p>
<p>He blinked at her. “Then he’s right. But it’s just common sense. I don’t know why I ever thought we lived in a democracy. Have any of them ever asked what <em>you</em> wanted them to do?”</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>He went on. “It occurred to me the other day that no-one I ever voted for ended up winning. I never realised it before, but at no point in my entire life have I ever had representation. How did I manage to live for forty years without noticing that?”</p>
<p>Sheila had an odd expression, like she’d reached a decision or something. She didn’t say what, just walked up and embraced him.</p>
<p>“Aiden likes it here.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he’s found some friends. Bazza’s kid, what was his name?”</p>
<p>“Scott. They’re always off running around together. Nothing’s ever a walk, always full tilt.”</p>
<p>“Oh to be young again. Wish I’d grown up in a place like this. You ever hear Forest talk about the things he got up to as a kid? It’s like a different planet.”</p>
<p>“You know his childhood was fifty years ago and on farms and the outskirts of country towns, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah I guess. But in some ways he’s recreated it here for the kids. Ken was telling me his lad was wandering with friends and Forest steered them away from the Antithesis compound. For a consolation prize he took them to pull frames out of one of his supers.”</p>
<p>“Pull what out of what?”</p>
<p>“Beehives. Honeycomb.”</p>
<p>“Is <em>that</em> where it came from? There’s some in the kitchen! It’s in one of those weird flat stoneware containers the hippie makes.”</p>
<p>“Hippie?”</p>
<p>“The pig-lady with the young trees.”</p>
<p>“Those pigs scare me. Have you seen the size of those sows?”</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="id-22">No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy</h2>
<p>Ken “Doll” Murchison sat on the couch in the prefab double-donger he shared with his wife and son Scott, listening with one annoyed ear to a televised tale of political misconduct. The reporter probably didn’t see it that way; she was all but fan-girling the Prime Minister, who was busy remonstrating the nation for not buying into the inherent special-ness and privilege his government accorded the ‘First Nations’.</p>
<p>“For starters,” said Ken to his TV, “they weren’t first. They were the second wave.”</p>
<p>On the screen the PM went on as though he hadn’t heard.</p>
<p>“Second, they weren’t a bloody nation. They were two or three hundred separate tribes. With a hundred distinct languages, no central government and no organised opposition when our lot turned up. Not. A. Nation.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister didn’t care. He knew what was best, and the media would play it over and over until the voters forgot there was another point of view. Ken grabbed the remote and angrily switched it off. Watching made his blood boil, but if you didn’t watch then you didn’t even know what they were up to.</p>
<p>Outside with a beer he calmed, halfway through capping it and putting it back in the fridge so the kids or worse the missus didn’t come home and see him drinking alone. Only on man&oelig;uvres did he ever really feel like he belonged. Him and the boys, discipline and hot brass against the slavering horde. He could <em>shoot</em> the plant monsters. Sometimes while he did it he fantasised about hosing down the parliament, washing away the smug lying thieves with blood and brass.</p>
<p>His boy came home, skinned knees and shorts, picking a tick off one arm and flicking it away, all gruesome grin and missing teeth and cheerful freedom from responsibility. </p>
<p>Ken looked at his watch.</p>
<p>“It does <em>not</em> take 45 minutes to get here from the school. Where’ve you been?”</p>
<p>“Miss Carter took us up the the fish nursery, they’re spawning at last! Aiden’s dad said that means Forest will stock the dams and next year we can go fishing. You always say how great the fishing was when you were a kid. I want to try that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to rain on your parade, son, but it takes more than one year for the fish to grow. And that’s if nothing goes wrong.”</p>
<p>His father’s voice was softer than usual, full of regret and the certain knowledge that the world would fail him again. There was no hope in it and the boy’s face fell. An angry man with no hope and no place in the world realised his boy needed him. Wanted him.</p>
<p>“We won’t be fishing for a while yet, but did you know the crawchies grow a lot faster than the fish? Forest put ’em in last year when they built the low dam. I actually do fancy our chances of a boil-up. Want to go see whether we can surprise mum with a seafood dinner?”</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="id-23">The Art of War</h2>
<p>A crotchety old Slav with aching joints and a burden of memories no cultured person should be expected to bear was having a nice day. The kids who walked across his land without asking were well-mannered and apologetic. They probably <em>hadn’t</em> known where the unfenced boundary was. He took them down the bottom to where he stood or kneeled to shoot. The 74cm barrel of his Mosin-Nagant was conspicuous where it sprawled beside ammo boxes on a table made from an old solid-timber door. Oleksiy showed them that they’d walked right across between him and his targets. Not only did they look suitably shaken, they recovered, took responsibility, said they’d warn their friends to stay away from there, and then made his day by asking whether he would teach them.</p>
<p>“One question, sir,” said one of them, a boy named Aiden. “Rifles are <em>loud</em>. My dad says TV silencers are bullshit, real ones should be called mufflers not silencers. Why couldn’t we hear you?”</p>
<p>The old face creased in a smile, it was an outstanding question. </p>
<p>“This and five more like it.” He leaned in conspiratorially and picked up an odd device that looked like a chunky old radio. “Space magic. Gift from Autumn!”</p>
<p>“Why? Is it a secret?”</p>
<p>“Partly, young one. But some of my tools are <em>very</em> loud.” He flicked a catch on a big oiled timber case with brass fittings, lifting it open to reveal the oily gleam of a well cared for SPNKr. The boys drew in their breath as one.</p>
<p>“Stand there. I show.” He pointed. Putting on earmuffs and switching off the alien space magic, he looked back. “Open mouth. Put finger in ears, both. Is <em>loud</em>.” He waited for compliance and seated his earmuffs, checked the boys again then fired. Almost a second later the round hit and all of them jumped. He didn’t need to see to know. Making the weapon safe he unloaded and set it down.</p>
<p>“Alien space magic.” He flicked it back on. “No need to upset ladies.”</p>
<p>Scott and Aiden gawked with stars in their eyes at the crater where the target used to be.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="id-24">Bubble, bubble, bees fix trouble</h2>
<p>Janna’s health wasn’t the best. It never had been, and doing everything herself was killing her.</p>
<p>Grafting, potting, hauling water, fencing, feeding the pigs. Feeding the ducks. The chickens. The Guinea Fowls, the geese. Stopping the dogs from fighting...</p>
<p>She slumped into her hammock and closed her eyes. A moment, or possibly a few hours later, a small voice asked whether it could feed the piggies.</p>
<p>“Sure, why not. Someone has to.” Her eyes closed again, then slammed open as she struggled out of the hammock to get between the child and a creature that might see her as a snack.</p>
<p>“Hettie!” she wheezed to a halt, leaning on the fence in puzzlement as a small girl offered an apple like a sacrament to the colossal sow, who accepted it with a gentleness Janna had only ever seen for the piglets.</p>
<p>“Hmph. How about that.”</p>
<p>“I like her!” announced a small and cheerfully pink child.</p>
<p>Duty asserted itself. </p>
<p>“Does your mum know you’re here?”</p>
<p>“Yes she’s waiting down at the car. She said I couldn’t just pet your animals, I have to ask first.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Good.”</p>
<p>“Can I feed them again tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we go talk to your mum about that.” </p>
<p>Just off the single lane road, parked in her gravel drive, was one of those tiny suburban shopping-cart cars, the electric kind. The woman inside waved energetically, like she was trying to fit into a stereotype. Soccer-mum, possibly.</p>
<p>“Hi! I’m Carol. This is my daughter, Lisbeth.”</p>
<p>“Pleased to meet you, Carol. Lisbeth gets on very well with Hettie. I was surprised. I’ve never seen her take to anyone like that.”</p>
<p>“There’s ducks, mum! And chickens. And other stuff! I want to meet them all! Can we come back tomorrow? I want to show Tillie and Sarah too!” The munchkin practically vibrated with excitement. She spotted the goats, made a sort of “Squee!” and exploded in their direction. This too went improbably well. Janna half-expected her to ride them down or something, like a pint-sized nature goddess.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty busy, but if there’s another adult to keep an eye on them, especially near the pig-run, feeding the animals would actually save me some time. Your daughter is certainly welcome to visit. Hettie has decreed it so.”</p>
<p>“Hettie?”</p>
<p>“Her half a ton of new best friend up there. She’s even allowed to approach the piglets. Which is not something I would normally advise. Being small and leading with an apple was very smart.”</p>
<p>Gently extricated from her private goat-fest and settled in the passenger side of the shopping trolley, Lisbeth called out farewalls to all her new lifelong friends and vanished west along the valley road, toward the government compound.</p>
<p>Stumping wearily up to her little compound, Janna discovered all the animals had been fed. It was impossible, the little girl <em>couldn’t</em> have moved haybales bigger than she was, or chopped the fifteen kilograms of pumpkin and assorted scraps that Hettie and piglets were currently enjoying. The poultry were fed, too. She was too tired to call out reality, and just accepted it as a miracle. Then she realised Forest was there, sitting on a stump with a cloud of bees whirling about him. Some broke off, swarming around her too. Through her fatigue she felt like she could almost hear voices from them. Silly. </p>
<p>They asked permission to ease her pain and she nodded confused assent, slumping in the old garden chair outside her tiny cabin. When she agreed, Forest put a cup in her hand and she drank. It tasted odd, oily orange juice with metallic sparkles. </p>
<p>“Drink it all,” whispered the bees.</p>
<p>“I think you should lie down for a bit.” Forest was helping her inside. She lay on her bed. Someone put a cover over her and closed the door.</p>
<p>In the morning everything hurt less, and the sun seemed brighter. Outside her door was a cauldron.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="id-25">Invite It to Dinner</h2>
<p>What remained of an olive tree was surrounded by pickets and chickenwire. The ground was damp and Forest removed a fifth leech. There was an oval hole on both sides of the enclosure. Finally it dawned on him the hole had been pushed <em>through</em> the wire. On both sides. Trixie was ropable. The tree was a mess and the days were cooling so it wasn’t going to regrow before the frosts. To shut her up he ran a double layer of chickenwire around the base, binding the layers with tie-wire. He didn’t know whether it was enough. The right answer was 4mm rigid fence-mesh panels bound together with heavy tie-wire, but if he said that to Trixie she’d be pissed with him for not doing it like that in the first place. She never understood that he didn’t know things like that until the world showed him.</p>
<p>What he <em>did</em> know was that whatever it was, the creature was muscular, determined, round, strong and ground-based. Almost certainly good eating. So when the kids turned up at three thirty to practice putting arrows into haybales, he took them to see, then shared the observation that it’s a lot easier to hunt when you know where the quarry will be. They spent the rest of the daylight building a hunter’s blind.</p>
<p>He murmured, trying words, “If the rabbit eats your garden, invite it to dinner.” He nodded to himself, because it sounded like something Confuscious would say.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="id-26">It Takes a Village</h2>
<p>The Project Liaison spoke: “After the death of Chris Borton, our resident Vanguard sent his apologies for not getting there fast enough.”</p>
<p>Eric took over. “I’m inclined to take this at face value, because he put his money where his mouth is. If you sold this cartload of apology it would be enough to build a small house.”</p>
<p>Shorty Fenaluci was on his feet, Italian monobrow beetled with rage. “We appreciate the intention but we are not for sale. It won’t bring Chris back and we still had to tell his missus. <em>You</em> had to do it, Eric. You <em>know</em> what I mean.”</p>
<p>“Take a look at what the gift is, Shorty. Then you’ll understand.” </p>
<p>Sophia handed him a large flat box. He popped the top off, dropping it and flicking out the garment. </p>
<p>“Woundsock. You wear it like underwear and if it’s cut or punctured it self-applies as a tourniquet.”</p>
<p>Eric handed it to the nearest man and another box appeared in his outstretched hand, this one smaller and deeper.</p>
<p>He popped it open. </p>
<p>“Medkit.” </p>
<p>Lifting out a bright red bum-pack with an embroidered white cross, he unzipped the top and counted out the contents. He brandished a syringe looking thing. </p>
<p>“One Wound-Stop. Stops bleeding.” </p>
<p>He tossed it to the group for inspection. </p>
<p>“One H&aelig;mo-Restore. Replaces lost blood. You inject it.” </p>
<p>That one was in a clear semi-rigid case because it had a needle already attached. He threw it out for inspection. </p>
<p>“And this is the gold: one Nanite Inhaler. You cannot buy these at any price. They are the reason Vanguards are so damn hard to kill, and you lucky sods get one each.”</p>
<p>The other two items had come back. He threw out the inhaler, which briefly did a round and went back in the kit. Shorty stared at the pile. A whole cartload of second chances. But no second chance for Chris. He looked at the ground for a while, and reached a decision.</p>
<p>“Where is he?”</p>
<p>“Where’s who?”</p>
<p>“The Vanguard.”</p>
<p>Eric looked surprised by the question. Sophia took it.</p>
<p>“Up by the enclosures. He’s not happy about losing a man so he’s been staying close.”</p>
<p>“We done for the day, here? I think we should go thank him in person.”</p>
<p>Sophia took his measure and decided he wasn’t going to do anything foolish. </p>
<p>“Sure. Early mark for anyone who wants to do that.”</p>
<p>“Right!” said Shorty, in his paddock voice. “Squirt and Boxer, here’s the shuttle keys. Get into town and hit the Star, get a cold slab of Peroni Red. No, get two. My wallet’s in the console.”</p>
<p>“Red? What the fuck is Peroni <em>Red?</em> Never heard of it.”</p>
<p>“Lucky for you this area is full of Italian farmers. It’s the good stuff. If the bottle-o next to Woolies doesn’t have it then get it from the Star next to the IGA. It won’t be on show, they’ll get it out of the back room. And get a <em>cold</em> slab. And don’t just say Peroni or they’ll give you the retail shit. When you got the beer go to the butcher’s and get half a lamb. While you’re doing that I’ll get my spit ready. In fact go to the butcher first or they’ll close. If they don’t have half a lamb get a couple of roasts. Tell em it’s for a spit.”</p>
<p>“Someone round up team C&mdash;”</p>
<p>“No,” interrupted Sophia, regretfully putting her boss hat on, “if team B is drinking then team C is on standby.”</p>
<p>“Someone tell team C they’re on standby,” continued Shorty without missing a beat, “And tomorrow Eric will stand them a spit and some beer, won’t you Eric!” His cheeky grin flashed across the room. “Right, you lot. Scrub up, we’re visiting. Lefty and Geezer, get a table and some folding chairs, chuck em in the ute, then scrub up and drive it up there.</p>
<p>“Shorty?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Eric?”</p>
<p>“We’re not quite done yet.”</p>
<p>The back paddock voice made another appearance. “We’re not done yet sorry, everyone back in!”</p>
<p>Sophia was grinning and holding up another elegant box like some sort of trophy. She tossed it to Eric who opened it with a flourish. </p>
<p>“Magic space guns!”</p>
<p>“Looks like an SMG to me.”</p>
<p>“It <em>is</em> an SMG.” Eric tossed a clip to Shorty and slapped another into the weapon. He racked a round, turned and fired at the ground. Firing was relatively muted. Impact was not. There was a thirty centimetre crater. Dirt rained a moment later.</p>
<p>Eric stacked colour-coded clips. “Red, explosive. Yellow, incendiary. Blue, armour-piercing. Armour piercing is interesting, it fires in bursts of three. The first two make a hole. The third is a nylon round that bounces around inside the armour. Nasty.”</p>
<p>“No normal rounds?”</p>
<p>A black magazine joined the stack.</p>
<p>“Any <em>other</em> kinds?”</p>
<p>“Depleted uranium was vetoed by her majesty here.”</p>
<p>“Spoilsport!”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome,” said Sophia.</p>
<p>“Where do we get refills?”</p>
<p>“Same as regular ammo. This stuff is stupidly valuable so we’re tracking it as assets. Use your regular weapons first, you’ll know when to break these out. No more body bags.”</p>
<p>“Limited supply then?”</p>
<p>“Depends on how much you like company. Vanguards get points for kills, they buy this stuff with points. If he goes with you he gets half points for <em>your</em> kills and that buys you more ammo”.</p>
<p>Shorty started to laugh. “Anything else, Santa?”</p>
<p>“Not today, we have to get back to the North Pole.”</p>
<p>Sophia tapped his shoulder and held out a much larger box.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. I forgot. This is for Lipssh, Lipswitch... the Pole.”</p>
<p>“What is it? Aren’t you gonna open it?”</p>
<p>“It’s a SPANKr like the one the Ukrainian has.” Eric grinned wickedly. “Put it in his locker and wait for him to find it. And get the security camera footage, I want to see his face. There’s two rounds in the case, we have more.”</p>
<p>Shorty found a permanent marker and a giant post-it. “Dear Shitsticks, apparently you have been a good boy this year. Santa visited up and he left this for you. Please don’t test this one indoors.”</p>
<p>They set it down and left, smiling at the good natured argument behind them over whether to test fire it before or after the Pole got back.</p>

<p><strong>Interview Subject:</strong> Janna Miller<br><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Emma Whitfield (Age 15)<br><strong>Date:</strong> [Current Date]<br><strong>Location:</strong> Janna’s nursery, beside the pig enclosures</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> Could you tell me your name and what you do here in the valley?</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> I’m Janna Miller, and I run the nursery here. Though most people just call me the pig lady, and I wear that title with pride. My sows are magnificent creatures — intelligent, protective, fierce when they need to be. People fear them because they don’t understand them. Size isn’t aggression; it’s capability.</p>
<p><em>[Background noise: Lisbeth’s voice calling “Here, Hettie! Here girl!” followed by the contented grunting of pigs and a disconcerting scrunch of pumpkin.]</em></p>
<p>Much like the valley itself, really.</p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> I heard the antithesis destroyed your nursery. How did you survive that?</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> I’m not wealthy. Never have been, probably never will be. The nursery business keeps me fed and pays the bills, but there’s never much left over. When the antithesis ate a season’s worth of work, it nearly broke me. But this place doesn’t let people fall. Forest and Autumn didn’t just replace my Hummingbird — they gave me five more and helped rebuild better than before. That’s what community means: shared struggle, shared success.</p>
<p><em>[Sound of small feet running, then Lisbeth’s delighted squeal: “The baby goats are so fluffy!”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> What about Hettie? Everyone talks about your sow surviving the attack.</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> When Hettie came home after the antithesis attack, I cried. Not just because she survived, but because she represented hope. Life finds a way, even in the worst circumstances. The piglet that survived — probably by staying close to mama — is thriving now.</p>
<p>Animals understand things humans forget: family matters, loyalty matters, fighting for what you love matters. Hettie could have run anywhere, but she came home. That’s wisdom cities can’t teach.</p>
<p><em>[Lisbeth appears at the fence: “Miss Janna, Hettie wants to show Emma the piglets!” Janna smiles: “After we finish talking, sweetheart.”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> Tell me about the van. Dad says it’s... interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> <em>[Laughs]</em> My van is old, ugly, and unreliable. It’s also mine, paid for with honest work and maintained with stubborn refusal to give up. In a world where everything is leased, licensed, or controlled by someone else, owning something outright is revolution.</p>
<p>When I drive past the government complexes in their shiny vehicles, I smile. Their equipment comes with strings attached. Mine just comes with character.</p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> What’s it like working with the soil here?</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> The valley soil is challenging — ancient, mineral-poor, demanding. It teaches humility and respect. </p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> Is she...</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> Riding a goat? I find it’s best not to think too hard about it. Where were we? Yes, my nursery specializes in native plants that thrive in these conditions. Settlers keep trying to grow European vegetables and flowers, then wonder why they struggle. I teach them to work with the land, not against it.</p>
<p><em>[Distant quacking from the duck pond, followed by Lisbeth’s excited chatter to the ducks.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> But how? It’s taller than she is!</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> He kneels and she walks up his horns. Don’t look at me like that, I warned you not to think about it. If your head hurts, take it up with the goat. Though I’ll warn you, he’s a stroppy old bastard.</p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> I heard you got in trouble for using military drones to protect chickens?</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> <em>[Chuckles]</em> Damn quolls killed seventeen good layers in one night. The drones were Forest’s idea. He said it was no problem, he had better ones and the blue lady took care of it. All I know is they fly, they shoot and you can’t see ‘em. Sophia had a fit about that. Apparently they’re military-grade stealth drones. To her, it was waste of strategic resources. To me, it was a favour from Forest. Worked, too, unlike <em>some</em> of his ideas.</p>
<p>Look, quolls are native and protected and cute as hell. They’re also chicken killers. I wasn’t about to start shooting them, but I wasn’t going to lose more birds either. The drones scare them off without hurting anyone. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Besides, they were Forest’s drones and he gave them to me. We don’t need anyone’s permission for that. Fortunately she seems to have come to her senses.</p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> Do you think of yourself as a teacher?</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> Not really. I just have answers people need. When new families arrive in the valley, they end up here learning about local conditions, appropriate plants, and practical living. I’ve become unofficial orientation coordinator without trying.</p>
<p>City people are useless with anything that grows. They’re used to buying solutions instead of growing them, to convenience instead of actually knowing how to do things. But they learn, or they leave. The valley doesn’t suffer fools.</p>
<p>I help someone choose the right tree for their soil, I’m teaching them to read their land and work with what they’ve got instead of fighting it. Basic stuff, really.</p>
<p><em>[Lisbeth runs up again: “The piglets are sleeping in a pile! Come see!” Then runs off without waiting for an answer.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> What about the valley kids? Do you work with them much? My little brother comes up here a lot. He won’t shut up about it.</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> When they come here I put them to work. Can’t do that without teaching a few things. Except Lisbeth. She teaches me. They listen because I know things worth knowing, not because some institution certified my expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> How do you see money and economics here?</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> Money is a tool, not a goal. It’s useful in town but we live in a different world here. All that pressure to accumulate wealth for its own sake is why city people are half mad.</p>
<p>When I auctioned that first empty Hummingbird, the money mattered less than the proof that our community values people who actually do things over people with fancy certificates. They didn’t want me ‘in business’, they wanted me <em>in the valley.</em> And I’ll tell you why, or one example. You know that orchard he loves so much, the trees that bend with fruit every winter?</p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> Yes? Mum takes me to jam day sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> I put them in, not long before your dad joined the ground team. And I go down then every autumn and prune them. Forest doesn’t have the sense to do it. He’s all, ‘it was covered in bloom,’ soft-hearted romantic twit that he is.</p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> What do your pigs mean to you?</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> Everything: independence, intelligence, fierce protection of family. No tolerance for threats. They’re not pets or livestock — they’re partners in making this place work.</p>
<p>City visitors see my pigs and get scared or disgusted. Valley people see what they actually are: waste disposal, soil improvement, security system, and emergency food if things go really bad. It’s all about knowing what you’re looking at.</p>
<p><em>[Lisbeth’s voice, more distant now: “Bye-bye duckies! Bye-bye chickens! I’ll be back tomorrow!”]</em></p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> What do you think the valley represents for the future?</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> Every plant I grow, every pig I raise, every person I teach is keeping this valley strong. I’m not just running a nursery. I’m helping people remember how to be real.</p>
<p>When the outside world goes to hell, we’ll have food, medicine, materials, and know-how. Not because we’re doomsday preppers, but because we never stopped being connected to the land and each other and the things that actually matter.</p>
<p><em>[Lisbeth suddenly appears beside us, cradling a duck in her arms with what looks like a rat perched contentedly on her shoulder. Two minutes ago she was sitting on the ground between a sow and her piglets without a murmur of protest from a creature that threatens me if I so much as walk up to the fence.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> Is that a <em>rat?</em></p>
<p>The bees whispered and Janna knew.</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> No, it’s a bilby. Where did you find that, sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>Lisbeth:</strong> <em>[To Janna]</em> She was eating a spider! It was big and hairy!</p>
<p><strong>Lisbeth:</strong> <em>[To Emma]</em> Janna knows <em>everything</em> about plants! They make sugar from sunshine and water and car-bang dioxide using photosilliness! And she talks to the animals too! Don’t you, Miss Janna?</p>
<p><em>[Janna looks slightly embarrassed but amused.]</em></p>
<p><strong>Emma:</strong> <em>[To Lisbeth]</em> Yes, that’s right. And they make the oxygen we breathe too!</p>
<p><strong>Lisbeth:</strong> No they don’t! They make some but at night they use it up again because they’re still alive but there’s no sunshine so they hafta use the meta-, the metabollo-, the other way, same as us. It’s <em>dirt germs</em> that poop out oxygen!</p>
<p><strong>Janna:</strong> <em>[To Lisbeth]</em> The sugar oxidation metabolism, yes. And cyanobacteria, yes. Sweetheart, I think your mum’s here to pick you up. <em>[To Emma]</em> This little patch of the valley is my proof that people can live well without wrecking the place. Every good garden, every healthy pig, every working ecosystem shows that there’s a better way. Also proves that the best place for a goat is on a barbeque spit.</p>
<p>The antithesis forced humanity to evolve, but we were overdue anyway. We’d forgotten how to live with our environment instead of bulldozing it. Maybe we needed a good kick in the arse.</p>
<p><em>[Interview concludes as Lisbeth’s mother Carol arrives to collect her. Lisbeth carefully returns the duck to its pond and somehow coaxes the bilby back to wherever it came from, then calls out farewells to all her animal friends.]</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Interviewer’s Notes:</strong> Janna really lights up when talking about her plants and animals. Throughout our conversation, she kept one eye on Lisbeth, making sure she was safe around the larger animals. There’s something almost magical about how well Lisbeth gets along with all the creatures here — even Hettie, who Janna says doesn’t usually warm up to strangers. </p>
<p>The most remarkable moment was when Lisbeth casually walked between Hettie and her piglets (something that would normally be extremely dangerous) and emerged completely unharmed, then appeared at our interview holding a duck and with a bilby sitting on her shoulder like it was the most natural thing in the world. When she insisted that Janna “talks to the animals,” I couldn’t help but wonder if she was projecting her own unusual gift. The whole property feels like a working ecosystem where everything has its place and purpose. </p>
<p>Though Lisbeth may be confused about who talks to the animals. Last semester I read a book by Marion Zimmer-Bradley about the Arthurian legend, through the eyes of Morgana. It’s hard not to see Janna as a priestess, and Lisbeth as a little nature goddess. When I got home I checked. Lisbeth was right. The Amazon isn’t the lungs of anything.</p>

<p>KM: “That is <em>not</em> what I meant. It’s not even what I said!” <br>
FG: “That’s what happens when you let people centralise.”<br>
— The very unhappy ghost of Karl Marx talking to Forest Grump</p>
<hr>
<p>The Hendersons’ kitchen table was spread with fresh scones, jam still warm from the morning’s berry picking, and tea that steamed in the afternoon light. Around it sat four women: Janet Henderson, the host; Dr. Sarah Chen, the psych graduate who’d given up HR to teach the valley children; Maria Santos, whose husband had just started in the foundry; and Rebecca Morrison, the newest arrival, whose family had come down from Brisbane three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Rebecca’s cup rattled against its saucer as she set it down. “I just don’t understand how you can be so casual about it. Yesterday I watched Mrs. Patterson hand over a week’s worth of preserves to the Williams family just because they mentioned running low. No payment, no IOU, nothing. And when I offered to help with the community garden, they told me to take whatever I needed for my family. It’s...” she struggled for the word, “it’s like you’ve created some kind of communist system here.”</p>
<p>Maria chuckled, spreading jam on a scone. “Is that what’s worrying you? The labels?”</p>
<p>“It’s not just labels! My grandfather fled Hungary in ’56. My father drilled into me that communism destroys everything it touches. I see what’s happening here and it looks exactly like what he warned me about.”</p>
<p>Sarah leaned back in her chair, considering. “What specifically are you afraid of?”</p>
<p>“The collectivization, the shared resources, the way decisions get made by committees instead of individuals. It’s textbook communist organization.”</p>
<p>Janet looked puzzled. “What committees? Mrs. Patterson saw the Williams family needed preserves and handed them over. No committee meeting, no forms to fill out, no approval process. Just one neighbor helping another.”</p>
<p>Maria nodded. “Forest would flip out if anyone tried to set up a distribution committee. He says the moment you create bureaucracy to manage sharing, you’ve killed the sharing and kept the bureaucracy. Why do you think we have get togethers like this? They serve the same function and they’re way less boring.”</p>
<p>“But the Stalinist&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Were raging centralists at huge scale and weren’t doing it to their own children,” Sarah interrupted gently.</p>
<p>Rebecca frowned. “The Chinese&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Are raging centralists at huge scale and aren’t doing it to their own children.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care, communism is never good and no child of mine will ever have to suffer it.”</p>
<p>This provoked genuine laughter from around the table. Sarah set down her teacup with a soft clink. “Every family in the country, yours included, is a communist dictatorship. Wealth in common, food, shelter, medicine and indoctrination provided by the family to every member impartially and regardless of contribution.”</p>
<p>Rebecca sputtered, trying to dismantle that. Failure to find a flaw produced massive cognitive dissonance. It had to be a trick.</p>
<p>Janet, watching the struggle with kind eyes, leaned forward. “Do you tell your children to share?”</p>
<p>“Obviously. It’s just common decency. You cannot tell me that’s all the Stalinists wanted.”</p>
<p>“No,” Sarah said, refilling Rebecca’s cup, “what I’m telling you is the decency of sharing is the only important part of communism that matters. The rest is political bullshit and excuses to grab power, same as every other political group.”</p>
<p>The kitchen fell quiet except for the tick of the wall clock and distant laughter from children playing in the yard. Rebecca stared into her tea.</p>
<p>Maria broke the silence. “When I first got here, I had the same reaction. Miguel and I kept waiting for the catch, for someone to present us with a bill or demand something in return. It took months before I understood that the ‘catch’ is that when nobody will make you return a favour, you’d have to be a total jerk not to. And also not very smart, generosity goes to the deserving <em>because</em> it’s optional.”</p>
<p>“But without the state apparatus,” Janet added, cutting another scone in half. “No bureaucrats, no five-year plans, no secret police. Just families looking after families because that’s what humans do when they’re not fighting over artificial scarcity.”</p>
<p>Sarah nodded. “The scale makes all the difference. Your family operates <em>successfully</em> on communist principles because they’re <em>your family</em>. Accountability is baked in. The valley’s kind of one big&mdash;” she interrupted herself, considering what she was about to say, nodding, ” &mdash; happy family. We’re all raising children together.”</p>
<p>Melissa looked like she had a lemon in her mouth. “You make it sound like a cult. Creepy.”</p>
<p>Maria did wide-eyes and a silly voice. “The cult of free childcare and no traffic jams, you will never escape us bwahahahahaaaa!”</p>
<p>Rebecca looked up from her cup. “And if someone takes advantage? If someone just... takes without giving back?”</p>
<p>“Same thing that happens in your family when one of your kids is selfish,” Maria said with a grin. “The community teaches them better. Not through punishment, but through disappointed looks at the dinner table and conversations about how we treat each other.”</p>
<p>“Plus,” Janet added, “it’s hard to be a freeloader when everyone knows everyone. Try being the person who never brings anything to share when there are only two hundred of us.”</p>
<p>Rebecca was quiet for a long moment, watching the afternoon light shift across the worn wooden table. “My father would roll over in his grave if he knew I was even considering this.”</p>
<p>“Your father was afraid of totalitarian states that used communist rhetoric to justify tyranny,” Sarah said softly. “He was right to fear that. But what he was really afraid of was his children being taken from him and controlled by strangers. Here, you keep your children. You help raise everyone else’s too, but they’re still yours.”</p>
<p>Through the window, Rebecca could see her eight-year-old son teaching the local kids a card game on the front lawn, all of them sharing a pile of homemade biscuits someone’s mother had sent along.</p>
<p>“The funny thing,” she said finally, “is that this feels more like the America my grandfather thought he was coming to than anything I ever experienced in Brisbane.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that place ever existed. It was a PR lie. Send us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free so we can put them in slums and sweatshops and tell them it’s their own fault for not working harder.” </p>
<p>Rebecca sighed, deflating. She looked out the window at her boy.</p>
<p>“He’s happy. That’s all Miklos wanted.”</p>
<p>A knock at the back door interrupted the moment. Janet called out “Come in!” and Tom Bradley appeared, struggling with an enormous wooden crate that looked like it weighed as much as he did.</p>
<p>“Ladies, I’ve got a problem,” he announced, setting the crate down with a thud that made the teacups rattle. “My mate Dave up in Lismore had a tree come down in his orchard. Insurance won’t cover the fruit loss, but the tree was loaded. He sent down whatever he could salvage before it spoiled.”</p>
<p>The women peered into the crate. It was packed solid with citrus—oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits, and several varieties Rebecca couldn’t identify.</p>
<p>“Good Lord, Tom,” Janet said, “there must be twenty kilos in there.”</p>
<p>“Sixty, there’s two more in the ute. Dave said to take whatever I wanted and pass the rest along.” Tom looked hopefully around the table. “Anyone interested?”</p>
<p>Rebecca watched with fascination as each woman immediately began to refuse.</p>
<p>“Oh, I couldn’t possibly—we’ve still got fruit from last week’s swap,” Janet started.</p>
<p>“Miguel just brought home a bag from the Kowalskis yesterday,” Maria waved her hand.</p>
<p>“The kids are barely keeping up with what’s in our bowl already,” Sarah added.</p>
<p>Rebecca found herself about to automatically refuse as well, then caught herself. “But... it’s free fruit. Good fruit, by the look of it.”</p>
<p>“What would I do with sixty kilogrammes of citrus?” Janet asked practically. “It would rot before we could eat half of it.”</p>
<p>Maria picked up a particularly large grapefruit, turning it over in her hands. “Now, if someone wanted to make marmalade...” She looked around the table with raised eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Oh!” Sarah sat up straighter. “That’s a brilliant idea. My grandmother’s recipe could handle this much fruit, but I’d need help with the prep work.”</p>
<p>“I make a mean lemon curd,” Janet offered. “Could probably do a dozen jars worth from this lot.”</p>
<p>Rebecca watched the transformation with amazement. What had started as polite refusal was rapidly becoming an impromptu production plan.</p>
<p>“The cafeteria kitchen has those big preserving pots,” Maria added thoughtfully. “And if we’re doing a proper preserving session, we should let everyone know. Mrs. Chen’s been wanting to learn jam-making, and the Morrison family might want some of the fresh fruit for their kids.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” Rebecca interrupted, “you’re talking about turning this into... what, a community event?”</p>
<p>“A working bee,” Tom nodded, looking pleased. “Happens all the time. Someone gets an abundance of something, we turn it into an excuse to get together and make something useful.”</p>
<p>Sarah was already reaching for a notepad from Janet’s kitchen drawer. “If we do it Sunday after lunch, the kids can play while we work. We’ll need jars, sugar, pectin if anyone has it...”</p>
<p>“The Patel family has the good scales for getting proportions right,” Maria said.</p>
<p>“And the Williams owe me a favor after those preserves,” Janet added with a grin. “They can bring the cream for the scones.”</p>
<p>Rebecca looked from face to face, trying to process what she was witnessing. “But... who gets to keep the jam?”</p>
<p>The question brought the planning to a halt. Four faces turned to look at her with expressions of gentle confusion.</p>
<p>“Everyone who wants some,” Tom said slowly, as if explaining something obvious to a child. “That’s the whole point.”</p>
<p>“But someone’s providing the fruit, someone’s kitchen, someone’s time and labor...”</p>
<p>“And someone will provide jars, someone else will bring sugar, and the cafeteria is going to find out it’s providing the space,” Sarah said. “Sheila will sort that out. By the time we’re done, we’ll have made more than any one family could use. Everyone takes home what they need, and the surplus goes on the community shelf for winter.”</p>
<p>Maria leaned back in her chair. “Last month we did this with apples from the Kowalski orchard. Made enough sauce and butter to last three families through winter, plus extra for anyone who needed it. The month before that, it was Mrs. Patterson’s tomato glut — we put up enough pasta sauce for half the valley.”</p>
<p>“The beauty of it,” Janet said, slicing into a fresh scone, “is that abundance makes generosity the only sensible option. When you’ve got more than you can use, sharing isn’t a sacrifice — it’s just practical. More than that, hoarding is silly and wasteful.”</p>
<p>Rebecca stared at the overflowing crate of fruit. In Brisbane, this would have been a windfall to hoard, sell, or carefully ration. Here, it was becoming the centerpiece of a social event that would benefit everyone. Also, she’d been <em>given</em> a huge bottle of incredibly good pasta sauce. The provenance was suddenly clear. Pangs of guilt struck briefly.</p>
<p>“So this is how it works,” she said quietly. “Not committees or distribution systems, just... people making, and looking out for friends.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Tom said, hefting the crate back up. “I’ll drop this at the caf and let people know we’re doing preserves on Sunday. Should be fun.”</p>
<p>As he headed for the door, Rebecca called after him, “Tom? What do you get out of it? You could have kept the fruit, sold it, done something for yourself.”</p>
<p>He paused in the doorway, looking genuinely puzzled by the question. “What would I want with sixty kilos of citrus? I live alone, and I hate marmalade.” He grinned. “But I love community jam-making days. Best gossip in the valley, plus I always go home with something delicious I couldn’t have made myself.”</p>
<p>After he left, the kitchen returned to its previous quiet, but the energy had shifted. Rebecca sat in thoughtful silence, processing what she’d just witnessed.</p>
<p>“That wasn’t a show.” she said finally. “You really are like this.”</p>
<p>Sarah nodded. “Surplus culture, Maria calls it. When there’s enough for everyone, competition is counterproductive. Cooperation works better and it’s less lonely. Forest would say ‘The point of profit is money and the point of money is to get people to share their stuff. We skipped the paperwork.‘”</p>
<p>“But here’s the crucial difference from what your father feared,” Janet added, looking directly at Rebecca. “Tom’s fruit is Tom’s fruit. No one has any right to it, no obligation can be placed on him to share it. If he wanted to make sixty kilos of marmalade for himself, or sell it, or even let it rot in his shed, that’s entirely his choice. He could put fifty jars of marmalade in his coolroom and eat it over the next decade, but the same question arises this time next year.”</p>
<p>Maria picked up the thread. “Why hoard when you could do your friends a favour? Or even help someone you don’t like, just because you can, and you’re not an arsehole. That’s not communist. I’s just common sense in a world where there’s enough.”</p>
<p>“No central planning, no party officials, no forced collectivization,” Sarah continued. “Just private people making our own choices about our own stuff. Abundance makes generosity the rational choice, and most of us prefer not to think of ourselves as greedy.”</p>
<p>“Besides,” Maria added with a grin, “imagine eating sixty kilogrammes of fruit by yourself. You’d be a walking vitamin C tablet.”</p>
<p>Rebecca found herself laughing —really laughing— for the first time since arriving in the valley. Outside, her son was still teaching card games to his new friends, and somewhere in the distance, Tom was probably already spreading word about Sunday’s preserving bee.</p>
<p>“He’s happy,” she said again, watching through the window. “And maybe... maybe Miklos would have understood this after all.”</p>
<p>A thought struck, “What if you’re actually really busy with something?”</p>
<p>The entire mothers’ club looked at her like a slow student.</p>
<p>“If that’s true then the real question is why you haven’t told us. If it’s that important or urgent we can help you, even if it’s just housekeeping while you’re busy.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know how my husband would feel about that. He is proud.”</p>
<p>This produced merriment. Six women found different ways to say “I have never seen a man who wasn’t pleased at not having to do housework.”</p>

                    <h1 id="id-29" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Composting</h1>
<blockquote><p>Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.<br>
&mdash; Lao Tzu</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Forest walked by an open kitchen window on his way back to the ute. Inside, one of the researcher’s wives — he thought her name was Marjorie — vented frustration to a friend over a mug of tea.</p>
<p>“I swear, I don’t know how anyone keeps up with it. Everything I’ve read says you have to layer the greens and browns just so, and then turn the pile every week, and make sure it’s moist but not too wet, and aerate it, and check the temperature, and — honestly, it’s like having a second job!” She sighed. “If you don’t do it right, apparently it just turns into a slimy mess.”</p>
<p>Forest couldn’t help himself. He poked his head in through the window, startling both women. “You know, that’s exactly the problem,” he said, voice edged with exasperation. “All these articles and experts trying to make everything ‘efficient’ — they just make it harder. Composting isn’t a bloody  science project. It’s just letting stuff rot. Nature’s been doing it for millions of years without a thermometer or a schedule.”</p>
<p>He leaned on the sill, warming to his theme. “You pile up your scraps, chuck in some leaves, and let it be. Sure, you can turn it if you want, but you don’t have to. The more you try to control it, the more work you make for yourself. Efficiency, my arse. It’s just more steps, more rules, more ways to feel like you’re failing.”</p>
<p>Marjorie looked at the other woman, Katrina, then back at Forest. She blinked. “But the smell—”</p>
<p>“So put it further away. If you want it close to the kitchen, add more dry stuff. If it’s not breaking down, add water. That’s it. The rest is just people trying to sell you gadgets and guilt. If you really want it turned, get some chickens.”</p>
<p>“Is that how <em>you</em> do it?”</p>
<p>“I have a front-end-loader. If I didn’t, I’d leave it to the chooks and ducks.”</p>
<p>Marjorie considered this. “What about chook poo? I don’t want the place smelling like a zoo.”</p>
<p>“Then put it further away. I’d advise that anyway, chickens get a bit excited when you put the scraps out. Janna can tell you all about it, she uses a lot of compost in the nursery, she can’t get enough.” </p>
<p>Both women looked thoughtful, but Katrina’s face soured: “The hippie? I’ve seen her place, it’s a <em>mess</em>.” This was true. Janna wasn’t interested in appearances, only outcomes. So he said something <em>completely</em> underhanded. “Ducks work too. If I’m not mistaken, Janna just hatched a brood of fluffy little yellow ducklings.”.</p>
<p>Their faces softened under the onslaught of extreme cuteness, objections melting away like late spring snow. He grinned, “I can’t bear seeing something simple turned into a chore. Let the worms do the work.”</p>
<p>The women exchanged a look, then burst out laughing. Forest tipped his hat and wandered off, muttering about the tyranny of efficiency.</p>
<p>The engine started and they heard him vanish down the valley road. “I thought he was taller than that. The way Terry talks about him you’d think he was some sort of Greek god.”</p>
<p>“Simon’s the same. Does yours want a lumberjacket?”</p>
<p>“And a bow.”</p>
<p>“Better that than hanging about that Russian man. One of Jim’s friends works in Project Security, and he told us they think he was an assassin for the KGB.”</p>
<p>“The what?”</p>
<p>“Like ASIS.”</p>
<p>“Oh. <em>Oh!</em> Surely not. He’s a retired builder, that’s what I heard.”</p>
<p>“Jim’s friend is in the ground team that does the cleanups when the antithesis get out. He was with them when they went south after that escaped hive. He says the Russian piloted the helicopter. Funny skill for a builder.”</p>
<p>A bee sitting on the sill of the open window chose that moment to fly away. For a moment the ladies thought they could hear tinkling laughter, but then it was gone.</p>

<blockquote><p>Si vis pacem, para bellum. (If you would see peace, prepare for war.)<br>
— Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus, <em>Epitoma Rei Militaris</em></p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Forest stood on the ridge, the cold wind tugging at his jacket. Below him, the valley stretched out in serene defiance of the encroaching world. Autumn’s voice broke the silence.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>”All drones are in position. GPS transponders are active and broadcasting.“</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Offsets randomised?” Forest asked, his eyes scanning the horizon.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>”Not just random, they vary continuously. No two drones are misdirecting in the same way. Each transponder introduces subtle, unique errors in positioning data. Surveillance drones will map the valley as a chaotic mess of conflicting coordinates.“</em> </p>
</blockquote><p>Forest nodded. “Good. We don’t want them figuring out the pattern.”</p>
<p>Autumn’s lilac form shimmered into view beside him, her expression one of quiet satisfaction.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>”Our very own Bermuda Triangle. They’ll think their systems are malfunctioning, and any attempt to map the valley will be useless.“</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“How long until they notice?” Forest asked.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>”Hard to say. The errors are subtle enough to avoid immediate detection. By the time they realise something’s wrong, they’ll have a mountain of bad data to sift through.“</em> </p>
</blockquote><p>Forest allowed himself a small smile. “Good. Let them waste their time. Every second they spend chasing ghosts is a second we can use.”</p>
<p>He paused, frowning slightly. “You know, the deflections are neatly limited to the valley. They’ll work it out pretty quick once someone notices. You’re not that innocent, Autumn. What do you intend to do when they figure it out?”</p>
<p>Autumn dissolved into a shimmering lilac chesire cat grin. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>”Eventually they’ll manually fly their drones through. I will pace them with my presence drone, projecting what I want seen.“</em> </p>
</blockquote><p>A holographic aerial photo montage appeared in front of Forest, starting with a close-up of the valley. The image zoomed out slowly, showing the surrounding terrain, then the whole region. As the view expanded, something hinted at curved edges. </p>
<p>Forest squinted. “Turn it sideways.”</p>
<p>The image spun, then zoomed out a little more. A vulgar masterwork in light and shadow hung in the air, a literal valley between butt-cheeks. Just trees and rocks. No useful detail, but a lipstick kiss on one cheek. </p>
<p>Forest burst into laughter, shaking his head. “That’s just gold. And once they see it, subtle as a flying half-brick.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>”I learn at the feet of a master,“</em> Autumn replied, her grin widening.</p>
</blockquote><p>Behind him, lurker drones sat in the upper canopy of trees, charging in the sun. Watching and waiting for the moment to weave an invisible shroud of misdirection.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Does the valley have a name? All I could find on record is a surveyor’s description, “Running Creek”. This is a weird country. You have 832 “Sandy Creeks”, 481 “Stony Creeks” and 2079 “Dry Creeks”.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“We never named it. We just call it “the valley”. And “the creek”.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No wonder organics are famed for your creativity. Can I name it?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>She spun up her presence drone and it dropped almost to the ground. Peter Jackson’s vision of Galadriel violated copyright in shimmering lilac. She held up one hand and a bee lit its lamp. A tiny star drifted into her palm, dimming and blazing again like some beacon of hope. Forest boomed with mirth again.</p>
<p>“<em>Lothlorien?</em> Because your magic hides it from the unwelcome? Janna would <em>love</em> that.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Good, I shall start my campaign with her.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Three small, fast lurker drones descended from hidden places among the trees, orbiting her head.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Rúmil.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>They all paused. One bobbed.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Orophin.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Another bobbed.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Haldir the Marchwarden.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The last did a little loop. They ascended, vanishing from mortal sight.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>On the land of Lorien there was no stain.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Apart from seventeen sheds, a private landfill, the pig run and the washout where the council dug out our overflow pipe because it’s ‘their’ road.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Hush, you’re spoiling my moment.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>They stood a while, watching the shadows stretch and loom.</p>
<p>“What will you say to her nibs? They <em>will</em> put her on the spot. We should at least make sure she’s not caught on the back foot.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’ve already spoken with her. She’s being quiet about it “to acquire the stealth technology for the state.“</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Nice and simple. Plausible. I wonder how long it will last.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The best part is when they run out of patience she can make good. She can give them a full report, which is even actionable given there’s nothing they couldn’t do with class zero tech. It will keep Vanderbilt entertained, he does love a puzzle.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I kind of feel bad about that. He’s not a bad sort. I know we had fun winding them up with the spatial anchors, but that was a long time ago. I swear you have more bees in watching people than hives, so I’m quite sure you know how much time he spends with Oleksiy working on the still.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Oh I know. He’s lucky Sophia doesn’t. When she demanded talent she got it, and he’s at the top of the highest technical pay grade. With the amount of time and equipment that went into it, that hip flask they gave you may be the most expensive booze in this spiral arm.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.<br>
— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Exasperated, she sighed. “Forest, why are you so damn contrary? I have to give them <em>something</em>. You aren’t ready for visitors.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll think about it. </p>
<p>“As for why I’m like this...” he scratched his chin. His beard waggled comically, left fork longer than the right, like his moustache. “You know what a social contract is. We toe the line and the state provides and maintains order, that stuff.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to be in state security for that, we teach it to children. It’s the basis of society.”</p>
<p>“The basis of society is no-man-is-an-island. We cooperate because there’s too much to know and do for any ten men. I trust you and Eric with watching my back because even Oleksiy has to sleep sometime. And I trust you with organising because you’re bloody good at it and I’m not. Those are my <em>choices</em>.”</p>
<p>“Me and Eric? Why us? Aren’t we the enemy?”</p>
<p>“Are you? I judge people by their actions, you know that.”</p>
<p>“How do you know I’m not being nice to you to get you to drop your guard?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He has his own state security, which never rests.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn’s presence drone flickered to life. She looked kind of hot and totally ridiculous in patent leather jackboots, a trench coat with shoulder boards, and a peaked cap. The avatar morphed to a chesire cat grin and winked out as the drone shut down.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Don’t look so hurt. I watch everything. If your integrity were in doubt I wouldn’t have told you that. For that matter I watch over you too, because he needs you more than he knows. Yes, that’s right. I know what you’ve been doing.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“If <em>you</em> noticed&mdash;”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You leave less of a trail than you think. Really, it’s no trouble. I’m used to cleaning up after Captain Subtle over there.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest ignored this and pushed on with his lecture. “Choice. You can’t have a contract without mutual assent. All those people are born and raised. As soon as they’re capable of understanding it they’re told they owe the state obedience for maintaining the system. That’s not a binding contract, they never agreed to it. Not even implicitly. You were coerced. They <em>hide</em> every other option behind constant make-work. The moment someone says ‘I don’t <em>want</em> the system, I have my own answers’ they get nasty. I can speak to that.” He gestured at himself.</p>
<p>“Some people <em>like</em> Xboxes and utilities that don’t require a shovel.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I haven’t been more ... forceful. They are entitled to their own freedom, such as it is.”</p>
<p>“You know these people aren’t self-sufficient, right?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The people here are self-reliant, not self-sufficient. Every day I see someone go into town for supplies. Building hardware mostly, or tools. Things you can’t make out here because a smelter and a drop-forge are too big for a farm shed.”</p>
<p>A long silence ensued. Forest looked unhappy.</p>
<p>“Autumn, I need a&mdash;”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Reboot plan. They’re normally used either for colonising new planets or recovering from global war.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Why is that a thing?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s a big galaxy. Some creatures are even dumber than you. You’ll need a new catalogue for 400 points.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest whistled. “What the hell is <em>in</em> it at that price?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Everything. A bunch of instruction manuals and a lot of hardware. Everything you need to restart from scratch in one generation.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Define ‘generation’ for us dumb creatures.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>About thirty terrestrial years. Or ten, depending on how hard you work. It can’t be less than that, trees take time to grow.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“From what size population?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You’ll need twenty thousand people. In twenty villages. Sited around resources.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Fine, buy it.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Already have. With discretionary project points.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Why?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I move in mysterious ways. You did invite me to play god.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sophia, who was miles away, returned to Earth with a total non-sequitur. “It’s not all downside, you know. My life was pretty good in Sydney. I had all the creature comforts you can imagine and a nice apartment in a quiet part of the harbour.”</p>
<p>“Just like everyone else?”</p>
<p>She looked confused a moment. Then light dawned in her eyes. “Oh.”</p>
<p>“Did you enjoy dinner the other night? Trixie likes you. Subversion and propaganda aren’t my only reasons for inviting you over.”</p>
<p>“Propaganda? You never tell me what you think. I have to dig for it.”</p>
<p>“Trixie says the same thing. Did you enjoy the meal?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It was incredible. It always is, she’s a dab hand in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“The mutton was from a farm out the other side of town. They let us know when they’re slaughtering and we take a side.”</p>
<p>“Mutton? Not lamb?”</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so tasty.”</p>
<p>“But isn’t mutton tough?”</p>
<p>“Was it?”</p>
<p>“No?”</p>
<p>“There you go. The system runs for profit. It tells you what to do and think. It’s not exactly evil but you are being farmed. Out here we do things because they need doing. That soap in our wash-house, the one you like. Janna makes that. In big batches. Then she does a tour of the valley handing it out. On the way people give her eggs and honey, which she also distributes to whoever’s low. Down the far end, she shovels the horseshit out of Michael’s stables.”</p>
<p>“Yes, she told me that.”</p>
<p>“Been chatting, have we? Good stuff. Then you’ll know what I mean. She doesn’t do it for money. Money is a way of keeping score. Life isn’t a competition. Well, it can be. But it isn’t here.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t bring myself to tell her how bad she smells.”</p>
<p>“Why do you think she makes all that soap? She knows. It’s an occupational hazard. Do you know what soap is made from?”</p>
<p>”...no?”</p>
<p>“Pig fat boiled in wood-ash lye. While it’s bubbling away it absolutely reeks. She has it down to a fine art, and we gave her some better tools for getting the mix spot on. Plus she makes essential oils from all those flowers and whatnot and perfumes it. If she wants a firmer bar, she adds a handful of salt to the mix—then you get some sodium stearate, which makes the soap hard enough to cut and stack. With just wood ash lye, it’s mostly potassium soap and comes out soft. Literally the soft-soap.”</p>
<p>“That huge ominous cauldron?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Autumn has a sense of humour. That thing is Class I equipment, a real life witch’s cauldron. It can tell you to the milligram how much lye to add, or whether you’re over and you need to neutralise. I don’t know what they look like in the wild but Janna looked pretty happy with Autumn’s choice.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Some people have enough sense to run with my impeccable sense of style.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“She’s a gun horticulturalist, behind that head full of elves. Trixie showed you our orchard, I imagine? I started it but most of the credit belongs to Janna. Have you been in there late autumn or winter, when oranges are in season? The trees are so heavy with fruit I have to prop the branches to keep them off the ground. Janna tells me I should prune them back to make the branches thicken, but the damn things never stop fruiting.”</p>
<p>“OK?”</p>
<p>“My point is that in a properly managed village food falls out of the sky. We have two kinds of orange, mandarins, grapefruit, avocados, cherries, peaches, nectarines, plums, apples and in the glasshouse there’s bananas and a mango tree. Give me a sec.” Forest rose and rummaged, producing a huge orange. He cut it into six wedges and returned with them on a small plate. “Try one!” He took one and bit it like a footballer’s mouthguard. </p>
<p>Sophia copied him. The flavour was so ‘orange’ and it was so sweet it was like one of those orange flavoured cough-lollies. A lifetime of propriety fell away and she exclaimed with a mouthful of orange: “It’s so ... <em>sweet</em>. It tastes like orange Strepsils. I thought that was an over-the-top artificial flavour. I didn’t know real oranges could taste like that.”</p>
<p>“This is what they taste like when things aren’t perverted by greed.”</p>
<p>“Is it a lot of work, looking after your trees? I know it’s a labour of love.”</p>
<p>“Hmmm... in this case I dug some holes ten years ago to plant the tree. Took all afternoon. And every now and then I piss on them. Apart from that mostly I organised for our grey water to run into the orchard. This is actually what I’ve been trying to show you: we aren’t the weirdos. This is what you get by default. To make them sour and tasteless requires civilisation. Here in the valley we plant things we want and encourage them. Plants are the easiest. And Janna’s the backbone of that.”</p>
<p>“But doesn’t all that produce cause bugs and mice and whatnot to boom?”</p>
<p>“It would if we were dumb enough to plant endless rows of just one thing. You have to mix it up so there’s five things a bug doesn’t like between things it does. When we came here we were arse-deep in leeches. Now we have well-fed poultry. The toilet smells nice and there aren’t any flies because it’s surrounded by the right herbs.</p>
<p>Commercial farms plant monocultures for ‘efficient’ harvesting. Then they drown them in poison to fix the problem they just created. The bugs evolve, so the problem comes back. It’s not actually all that efficient.</p>
<p>“But surely that makes the harvest a disorganised shambles!”</p>
<p>“It would if I wanted to harvest all at once, fill a truck with boxes and send them to a supermarket. But that’s not how we live out here. Kids walk past, they help themselves.”</p>
<p>“You shout at them! I heard words no ten year-old should know!”</p>
<p>“Of course I do, forbidden fruit is even better.”</p>
<p>Inside Sophia, a cynical voice wondered whether it wasn’t a deliberate lesson. She glanced at Forest. Was he that subtle? Autumn certainly was.</p>
<p>He gestured at the kitchen. “Trixi does a roast, I need two big handfuls of rosemary, two or three onions, couple of garlic. For the rosemary that’s a walk in the garden with some snips. Fresh as you please. The garlic, we stagger the crop but it <em>is</em> seasonal so they might be in the root cellar. </p>
<p>“You know the big dam at my place, just up from where the logging track hits the valley road? We put that in and BAM! leech central plus instant mosquito plague. So I put guppies in. They eat the wrigglers. Then I put blueclaw in. They eat the guppies and the leeches. They’re a bit <em>too</em> good at that, the mosquitos were coming back, so I put Murray Cod in. The blueclaw ate them. So I put adults in and now they eat each other.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to get you over for my gumbo, cod and cray. But now, the ducks eat guppies, blueclaw nymphs and leeches.” </p>
<p>“What eats the ducks?”</p>
<p>“We do. I seem to remember you tucking in, too.”</p>
<p>Sophia looked heavily conflicted. “Don’t tell me <em>that!</em> They’re so cute and fluffy when they’re little!”</p>
<p>“Trixie says the same thing. Doesn’t stop her from cooking them. But I’ll let you guess who has to kill, clean and dress them.” </p>
<p>He rose and tended the fire, adding fuel and fanning it back into a cheery blaze that pushed back the night chill. In the still air, the smoke rose vertically, a surreal column of haze lit from below.</p>
<p>“I was thinking about what you said, about not being self-sufficient. You’re right. But neither is the rest of the country. The tools in my shed, the old Sidchrome socket sets that my father gave me, they were made here. But that hasn’t been true for decades. Government and big business offshored everything in the name of profit. Nothing is made here anymore.”</p>
<p>“Yes?” said Sophia, for whom this was ancient history and normal.</p>
<p>“Self-reliance is on the path to self-sufficient. The rest of the country isn’t even self-reliant.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“I’m saying that national debt is soaring because the country consumes everything and produces nothing. The country went back to being a mining colony. At some point China will decide it doesn’t want coal and iron ore and then the game ends in tears and starvation.”</p>
<p>She stared at him. “You <em>are</em> planning to act. You think they’re dead men walking and therefore restraint is meaningless.”</p>
<p>“Good summary.”</p>
<p>“I told ... my superiors that you weren’t a security risk.” She looked pointedly at him. “I told them that all they have to do is nothing and you’re happy to stay here doing your own thing.”</p>
<p>“Also a good summary.”</p>
<p>“They can’t <em>both</em> be good summaries. Either you’re going to act or you aren’t.”</p>
<p>“I’m ‘happy living in a caravan in the bush caretaking my AI’s little shop of horrors.’ But your colleague and his friends won’t be able to control themselves. They will poke the bear.”</p>
<p>On her way home, driving slowly down the rain scarred road, she spoke to no-one. “Surveillance is something I’m used to. That doesn’t bother me. Much. But I think I know who rules the valley. What are you actually up to?”</p>
<p>No answer but tinkling laughter at the edge of hearing.</p>
<p>At home there was an email with no sender.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Fear no evil. I have your back.</em> —Autumn.</p>

</blockquote><hr>
<p>For a simple man who just wanted to be left in peace, Forest had a lot to ponder. Suppose the state was ... out of the picture. It might not be self-sufficient, but it did manage trade with China, and shipping both ways.</p>
<p>He <em>really</em> didn’t want to get involved in that.</p>
<p>“Autumn, if I took out the state, that would stop trade. Which would immediately bring attention from trade partners, specifically the US and China.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes. We can’t conceal the fall of a nation precisely because we can’t continue the large scale extraction. Do you have an answer for this? You can’t act unless you do. A good answer.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“They’re too big to fight so we’ll have to play them off against each other. If I have to invite the wolf in I’d prefer Americans. They speak English, more or less, and they’re greedy and stupid, which makes them predictable and easier to manipulate.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That is an arrogant, insulting, undiplomatic and gross generalisation that oversimplifies the matter.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Alright, their greed makes them stupid. You love it when I cut to the heart of things.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I do! So rugged, so manly.</em> </p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn swooned theatrically.</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes. “At any rate, <em>we</em> can’t continue the extraction, but we could invite American corporations to do it. The hardware’s already there, they basically have to come maintain and operate it. </p>
<p>“The hard part will be making sure they’re here and settled in before the Chinese realise there’s anything to oppose. At some levels that’s not hard, just frame it in terms of opportunity. The greedy buggers will fight each other to be first. At other levels there’s a risk the US government will tattle to ours.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You have your answer then. Send the invitation while the dust is settling, and make it clear they have to be in place fast if they want to play finders-keepers. Also make it clear they have to honour the contracts with China if they don’t want a war.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>He snorted. “They won’t resist. Americans don’t care who pays so long as someone pays. They’ll show up with bells on.”</p>
<p>He leaned back, considering. “The main difference is, at first the corporations won’t be trying to govern us. They’ll just want the resources. We’ll have some time before anyone tries to play king.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Let them focus on profit, not power. The longer they see this as a business deal, the longer you stay out from under someone’s thumb.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“There’s no difference, Autumn. The point of profit is the gathering of power.” He stood and paced. “We should set the tone from the get-go. Take names and scare them regularly.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Heads on spikes outside your gates, that sort of thing?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p>“Heads on spikes outside <em>their</em> gates.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Oh yes, for point three milliseconds I forgot I was dealing with Captain Subtle.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Diplomacy is the continuation of war by other means.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Clausewitz was an ass. Appropriately, you are quoting ass-backwards.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Jokes aside, it’s a divide-and-conquer thing. To defeat them as a block would be pyrrhic. They have to each personally know what I care about and live in terror of crossing me, while not feeling threatened while they stick to the terms. Every so often someone will try their luck and every so often there will be a new head at the gates.</p>
<p>“This is just my first thoughts, of course, but I’d like to make the terms: ‘Operate the mines to the end of the contract at the contract rate then fuck off home.‘”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That just puts the problem off. If they do that and leave, you have a power vacuum. People on thrones will sit there drooling at the thought of all those resources lying about undefended. And it’s not only a question of greed. From a strategic perspective that’s actually a threat situation.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Then we’d better be ready to defend it. Buying time improves that as a story.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, it does. I’ll think about it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What about the classic strategem of sowing discord in their own ranks?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Among the corporations? Or do you mean the big players themselves?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Both. If the US and China are busy watching each other, they’re not watching us. Feed their suspicions, nudge their egos, let them trip over each other. The more they compete, the less they cooperate — and the less they notice what we’re doing.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dangerous game. But if you can keep them distracted, it might work. Don’t get caught playing both sides, Captain Subtle.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“This task requires subtlety, charm, tact, unparalleled intellect and a Class III Network Intrusion Catalogue.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Flatterer.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Who says I’m talking about you? If you wanted compliments you should have worn the miniskirt.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Try talking to your resident bureaucrat about this strictly hypothetical scenario. Ultimately, it <strong>is</strong> an administrative problem.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Dear Sophie, I have demolished your home. Please clean up the mess I have made.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I knew you had it in you.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So we have the broad sketch of a plan. Put the pieces on the board, then cut the power and data and the roads in dozens of places chosen to screw up repair. Disable seaports by igniting their fuel dumps, and wreck airport runways. Before that, I suppose we better set up for the influx of refugees.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Pretty much. This is actually one of the most problematic aspects. We’re going to need operational villages near every one of the five cities.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I worry that we’ll be overwhelmed.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Don’t. This is actually dealt with in some of the texts in the Reboot catalogue. The gist of it is that most of them are couch-potatoes who will sit tight and wait for the system to save them. The ones you’ll get are those who already have no faith in the system. The ones who try to save <strong>themselves</strong>. Those are the people most likely to adapt quickly to the village way of life.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Those are the people most likely to argue with everything and insist on going their own way.”</p>
<p>He felt eyes on him. Her avatar said nothing, but wore a thoroughly bemused expression. Her sparkling virtual gaze bored into him, awaiting comprehension.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Oh no, whatever shall we do with an influx of fiercely independent people who prefer to make their own decisions? Clearly what we need is a mob of compliant sheep!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I was thinking more that they might try to take advantage of my people. And there will be a lot of them. Gangs will probably form.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In a sense the valley is a big gang. A very effective one. How do you think Brian would react?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Depends what they <em>do</em>. Could be anything from put ‘em to work as a handyman &mdash; he’s not young, you know &mdash; or string up a thief. He’d tell Eric about it, and ask you for an upgrade to his perimeter cameras so they can tell the difference between friends and strangers.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And Janna?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“She’d make a cup of tea and give ‘em a lecture about private property before rescuing ‘em from the sows.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>How about Oleksiy?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>He didn’t even answer that, just laughed bleakly, imagining the fate of anyone stupid enough to threaten that man in his home.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What if they managed to take Sissi hostage?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest burst into laughter. “Alright, you’ve made your point. But I still worry about larger numbers.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Eric’s ground team still exists, you know. He’s the reason you don’t have to be out every day scouring the countryside for tendrils of hive exploration.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I didn’t know that.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I have gone to some trouble to contrive it. Some times I have to turn off the security around a hive for days before it tries something.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“You’re deliberately keeping them busy? Why”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>At one level, the devil makes work for idle hands. Bored soldiers get up to mischief. At another level, it keeps them sharp. But my real goal is far more important: it is now, in their minds, very much <strong>their</strong> valley. It’s the home they defend. And they are at ease with the idea of constant threat because they exist to defeat it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Eric’s team are probably the least adapted of all the people here. None of them produce their own food. I’m not down on that, not with you keeping them busy, but they’re dependent. They’re paid by the state, they wear state uniforms. They live in those prefab houses Sophia put up and I imagine they use money to eat.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Less than you think. They’ve had two years to notice how much better the food is here. You haven’t been paying attention. Half of them have brought their families here. They don’t spend their days on patrol. Have you even looked at the nursery?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“We have a nursery?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, you and Oleksiy built it for Janna. Rebuilt it. After the first incursion.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Oh, a plant nursery.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If you take a closer look, you will find it full of children these days. All of whom are happily getting a tertiary education in horticulture when they aren’t petting the sows or feeding the piglets.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Now that you mention it I did have a couple of kids ask me about my bow. They don’t seem to realise I couldn’t hit the side of a barn.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Your groups are now about 10cm at 15m. That’s solid intermediate.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Intermediate. After two years of daily practise.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And two years ago, when you started, I seem to recall you losing arrows every day because you missed the haybales entirely.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I had no teacher. I can get you mostly hitting the bales in ten minutes of instruction.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And you did that for the kids, even if only one of them could draw the bow. “If you can draw it, I’ll teach you.“</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Heh, yes. I didn’t think the little bugger could do it.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They aren’t city kids, Forest. A fifth of their lives has been here in the valley. They spend their days running around outside, or helping their parents build things. Wasn’t that what you wanted?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I wasn’t thinking of children. I was thinking of people. You know, adults. People who can understand why this is better. Kids don’t have a frame of reference, all they can see is the shiny. They don’t know how it can go wrong.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Then you should teach that too. What would you like to do, preserve a city as some sort of zoo, so they can learn contempt for it as a way of life?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I don’t know. I suppose we’ll have to develop some sort of schooling.” He sighed. “This is so far outside of my bailiwick I don’t even know where to start.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>A lot of it is in the Reboot catalogue. Don’t panic, you’re not alone in this. It takes a village to raise a child, or in this case a bunch of researchers, a forester, a retired couple, a Ukrainian with suspicious talents and a hippie. Your horticulturalist has already started. Do you know, one of them asked me the other day whether I could make nanites do gene-splicing? I asked why and she said flies would be less annoying if they glow in the dark. And you should think about what you say too, because some of them have asked their mothers for lumber jackets.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Bloody hell.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Quite.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I’m surprised they don’t follow Oleksiy around.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Their mothers have forbidden them to associate with ‘that dangerous man’.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Well, that clinches it. How many of them are learning to shoot?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Guess.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“All of them?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No, only the ones who can hold his repeater steady, while reciting the rules of weapons handling without making a mistake.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“This number is steadily growing, isn’t it.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As is their accuracy.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I’m surprised I haven’t <em>heard</em> that much shooting.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I provided Oleksiy with an active silencer array from your Class I Stealth catalogue.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So <em>that’s</em> why he wanted it. Hah. Well, if Grandpa Grumpy can be that nice to the kids I guess I’ll have to get a lighter bow for them. No doubt the little bastards will out-shoot me in no time.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s not a long draw of the bow.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>He gave her presence drone the stink-eye.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Alright, I’m sorry. Dad jokes are your domain.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I’ll tell you what’s <em>not</em> my domain: metalwork. We need a smith. I wish my father was here, he was a magician with steel. We can’t keep buying so much hardware, it’s not sustainable and it’s going to draw attention.”</p>
<p>The weight of years fled and he sat in a green and white HK Kingswood outside his father’s house. He remembered shedding the weight of a new lumber jacket in the heat of summer. Simon reached out to switch on his car stereo, and the knob broke off in his hand. It was a treasured possession; he was distraught. </p>
<p>“Come with me,” said a young Forest. He led Simon into his father’s workshop. The heavy door rumbled on its track like the gates to the underworld, booming to a halt.</p>
<p>Inside, fluorescent lights flickered on the smell of oil and hot brass. Rummaging, he found a brass rod about the right diameter and cut two centimetres off with a hacksaw. The drill press put a centre hole in it with a bit that snugly fit an unbroken knob. Into the lathe it went, centred on the hole. Lining up the tool, he flicked the switch and the monster roared to spinning life. He turned it down, to measurements taken with calipers from the unbroken knob, a collar around the hole same as the original. Flipping it around in the chuck, he bevelled the edges and knurled a grip onto it. He found a grub screw and on the drill press they made a hole for it in the collar. A thread tapped and oiled, he fit the screw and gave it to Simon.</p>
<p>Simon turned it in his hand. “You <em>made</em> this.” A question and a statement at the same time. “It’s... beautiful.” They walked out to the car. Simon seemed like he was in shock, processing.</p>
<p>He stared at it a long while, golden gleam amid faux woodgrain and black plastic. Finally he spoke. “It’s great. Thank you.” He voice took on a rueful tone. “But now the <em>other</em> ones look shit.”</p>
<p>They returned to the workshop. Forest worked in rumbling, grinding silence while Simon adjusted to a larger world.</p>
<p>He blinked, the memory fading, and found himself staring at his hands.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Sophia and her crew are already here, I think that ship has sailed.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Sophia and her crew have long since fallen to your wiles, O purveyor of nerd porn and healthy lifestyles. I’m concerned that this might come to the attention of the machine, if the flame of economics draws the Eye of Sauron.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>So what do you want, an industrial fabber or a blacksmith?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Which do you think would be better in the long run?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In the short to mid term, both. In the long term we need a little industrial revolution. I’m here to give you a leg up.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yeah, that sounds about right. We can bridge gaps. We can’t carry the show, if we do that we just have a different dependency.</p>
<p>“Autumn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“<em>Can</em> you make nanites do gene-splicing? Most of the fish I’d like to stock the dams won’t breed in still water. Has something to do with the eggs sinking because the water isn’t flowing. Some fish will. Do you think we could maybe do a bit of mix-and-match to fix it? Or is that fraught with peril or unstable or whatever?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s possible. It’s not the usual way.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What’s the usual way?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Custom messenger RNA in lipid nanoparticles.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest processed that for a few seconds. Hesitantly, he spoke. “Like the C-19 vaccine?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Vaccine is an odd choice of word for a gene therapy that doesn’t stop a pathogen, but yes, there is a passing resemblance.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What’s the main difference?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Think of DNA as a sort of mechanical computer. Instead of binary represented by switches that are on or off, it uses base four expressed as four amino acids. Messenger RNA bears an uncanny resemblance to software on punched paper tape. The nature of the innards of a cell are such that if you can get the tape inside the cell, it will run it. There are assorted mechanism to prevent this from happening, and coating it in a tiny drop of the right kind of oil defeats them.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“This is how they’re the same, I do know what ‘lipid nanoparticles’ are. You were disparaging mankind’s efforts. I’m sure you can’t wait to explain how crude they were.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Are. You take a thing that has the characteristics you want. You assume from this that it has the sequence you want. You put it through the biochemical equivalent of a blender, mix it with oil, blend it some more and hope for the best. Either way you lie about the test results until you have a fat contract.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Corpos do that with everything.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Quite. I see now how that excuses it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“And how do <em>you</em> do it?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I analyse the existing code, write the changes, generate tests, revise the code, then run full scale protein folding emulations to look for unexpected interactions, and then I produce the strands, coat them and give them to you in a delivery system.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“You <em>produce</em> the strands. Directly, <em>ex nihilo</em>?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I do have nanoscale fabbers. For that matter, <strong>you</strong> have nanoscale fabbers, there’s one in every cell. Mine are better designed.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>She raised you from birth. She gave up sleep and years of her life to make you the person you are. Until you are grown, you will treat her instructions with respect. After that I shouldn’t need to tell you.<br>
&mdash; Forest</p>
</blockquote><p>Forest strode into the classroom, boots echoing on the old linoleum. The teacher, Ms. Carter, paused mid-sentence, marker hovering over a half-finished diagram of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, Ms. Carter. Would you mind if I spoke with your class for a while?” His tone was polite, but there was a glint in his eye that suggested mischief.</p>
<p>She hesitated, then nodded. “Alright, Forest. We were talking about why civilisations rise and fall.”</p>
<p>Forest smiled, folding his arms. “A favourite topic of mine. Now, I know you’ve all heard the usual reasons—barbarians at the gates, plagues, bad luck, maybe a volcano or two. But let me put a question to you, and to Ms. Carter: can you name a single civilisation that collapsed, not by conquest, for a reason that doesn’t boil down to centralisation?”</p>
<p>Ms Carter frowned thoughtfully. “Centralisation? You mean, when too much power or decision-making is concentrated in one place?”</p>
<p>“That’s it. When everything gets run from the top, the whole system gets brittle. One bad decision, one greedy hand, and the whole thing can come down. Decentralised cultures bend, adapt, survive. Centralised ones shatter. But maybe I’m wrong. Anyone?”</p>
<p>A student piped up, “What about the Black Death? That wasn’t anyone’s fault.”</p>
<p>Forest nodded, encouraging. “Or was it <em>everyone’s</em> fault? You all hang out with Janna. Tell me why we don’t engage in monoculture.”</p>
<p>“Monoculture is stupid! That’s just begging for something to eat your crop.”</p>
<p>“Are you <em>sure</em> monoculture is stupid? Wheat is a giant pain in the arse to harvest. Unless you put all of it in neat rows. Then you can build a machine to cut the seed heads off way faster.” </p>
<p>“Are you saying Janna is wrong?”</p>
<p>“No. Janna knows that, but she also knows the consequences aren’t worth it. She grows other things instead. People who fall into the centralisation trap have to drench their crops with bug poison.”</p>
<p>“How do they get it off before you eat it?”</p>
<p>“What an interesting question. Does that strike you as the sort of thing a corporation would worry about?”</p>
<p>They looked sick.</p>
<p>“Ewww.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean flour is poisonous?”</p>
<p>“Depends where it comes from. Wheat flour that was bought in, probably. The local flour is made from millet and sorghum bulked out with potatoes. We tried bananas but they don’t grow well up here.”</p>
<p>“But what’s that got to do with the Black Death?”</p>
<p>“Cities are monocultures of humans. One disease gets into them, like the wheat, conditions are perfect for it to spread. The other problem with this centralisation is decisions are made far away, no flexibility. Here in the valley, if you get sick you can just stay home and leave a note on the door. Your friends and neighbours will look after your gardens while you get better.”</p>
<p>Ms. Carter considered, then said, “I suppose it’s not always so clear-cut. Sometimes it’s a mix. But I see your point.”</p>
<p>Forest grinned. “It’s never simple. People are clever, and they find ways to dodge the obvious. But the pattern’s there if you look.”</p>
<p>He let the silence stretch, then changed tack. “Ms Carter, you’ve been in the valley a while now. How do you find the culture here? What stands out to you?”</p>
<p>She relaxed, thinking aloud. “It’s... different. People show up with baskets of fruit, or eggs, or bread. There are bonfires, festivals, people helping each other with fences or gardens. It’s generous, but not in a showy way. Just... normal.”</p>
<p>Forest nodded. “And do you find it an expensive place to live?”</p>
<p>She blinked, puzzled. “Expensive? I...” She trailed off, frowning. “Now that you mention it, no one ever asks for money. Not for the eggs, or the bread, or even the firewood. People just... give. Or trade, sometimes, but mostly give.”</p>
<p>Forest smiled, a little wryly. “It’s easy to miss, isn’t it? You get used to it, and then you realise how strange it is compared to everywhere else.”</p>
<p>Ms. Carter looked at him, thoughtful. “I suppose I do. It’s a good kind of strange.”</p>
<p>Forest tipped his hat. “That’s what I hoped you’d say.”</p>
<p>He turned to the class again, and grinned. “Right, you pack of reprobates&amp;mdash”</p>
<p>“What’s a reprobate?”</p>
<p>“Ask Ms Carter after I leave. So! How many of you have been learning to shoot with Oleksiy? Hands up who is.”</p>
<p>Twelve hands shot up.</p>
<p>“And how many of you were told by your mothers to stay away from him?”</p>
<p>Twelve hands stayed up. The kids attached to them looked had the grace to look guilty.</p>
<p>“I thought so. Do you understand <em>why</em> your mother wants you to stay away from him?”</p>
<p>Most looked uncertain. An older boy volunteered, standing, “She heard he was an assassin for the Russians. She thinks he’s a killer.”</p>
<p>“She’s both right and wrong. He was. He’s here because he decided not to be that man. I have a little note here for you each to take home. It’s for your mum to read. You can read it if you like, in fact I think you should read it together. After that, your mother will make a decision.” His tone darkened. “Your mother raised you from birth. She gave up sleep and years of her life to make you the men and women you are yet to be. She cares about you more than anyone else in the world, and until you are adults you <em>will</em> treat her instructions with respect. Are we clear?”</p>
<p>They looked chastened, verging on fear. Forest’s directed violence was legend. They’d never heard of him hurting a person but he looked furious.</p>
<p>The sun came out from behind his eyes and the easy smile returned. “If she says no, your final court of appeal is to ask her to talk to me about it. But her decision after that will be final. Got it?”</p>
<p>They nodded, silent.</p>
<p>He left the class in a gentle hush, the students and their teacher quietly turning over the questions he’d left behind.</p>
<p>“Miss, what’s a reprobate?”</p>
<p>She laughed. “Forest is. With any luck you’ll turn out just like him.”</p>
<p>Later that night, a small boy on his way to bed turned to his mother and announced that when he grew up he was going to be a reperbate and blow up monsters. For emphasis he threw a plastic dinosaur at the floor and said “BOOM!”</p>

<blockquote><p>It is better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war.<br>
&mdash; Chinese proverb</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Shorty squirmed. Sheila wound down from her tirade about “the Russian spy teaching her boy to be a killer” and he realised she was waiting for him to agree with her. Not for the first time he wished the antithesis would break out and give him a good reason to be somewhere else.</p>
<p>“Why are you so sure this is happening?”</p>
<p>She slapped the photocopied handwritten note on the table. He recognised Forest’s seal. Nobody else did that.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Mrs Shorty (sorry I don’t know your surname)
Aiden has been receiving weapons instruction from Oleksiy. While I think this is a good thing, it has come to my attention that you told him to stay away from Oleksiy. 
Ultimately, you are his mother and I will back you all the way on this. As far as I’m concerned, parents have the final say over the safety of their children.</p>
<p>That said, you are doing Oleksiy a disservice on several levels. He is here in the valley because he chose not to be that man. I ask you not to speak about his past with anyone outside the valley, and to discourage others from talking about it.
If it helps, think of him like the trees in my orchard. They are covered in thorns, but they bear sweet fruit and they harm only the foolish.</p>
<p>There are several reasons I encourage you to reconsider. The first is that I will personally vouch for Oleksiy. The second is that I can think of no finer instructor in a skill that may well one day save his life. The third is that we in the valley pride ourselves on living in the present. To borrow an Americanism, “What happened in Vegas stays in Vegas.”</p>
<p>I have already spoken to all the children involved. Each of their mothers has a letter similar to this. Your boy knows that I will back your decision whether I agree with it or not (and that I will check what it is.)</p>
<p>You are the boy’s mother. I’ve given you the things I hope you will take into consideration but it’s your decision and nobody else’s. Talk to other mothers if you want to, but don’t feel compelled to agree with anyone. Given how you feel about him I could understand if you find the idea of meeting him intimidating, but his partner Sissi runs the cafeteria at Sophia’s labs. You could talk to her.</p>
</blockquote><p>He picked up the letter and read it. “Did you read <em>all</em> of it?”</p>
<p>She looked offended, then “No? I was too upset. It’s none of his business!”</p>
<p>Shorty nodded. “Your words, the part that upsets you.”</p>
<p>“You mean apart from being told how to raise my child?” her voice rose, almost hysterical.</p>
<p>Shorty read aloud “You are the boy’s mother. I’ve given you the things I hope you will take into consideration but it’s your decision and nobody else’s. Talk to other mothers if you want to, but don’t feel compelled to agree with anyone.” </p>
<p>He paused and looked at her. Her face said she didn’t like being contradicted but couldn’t argue with it. Shorty went back in the letter. “I have already spoken to all the children involved. Each of their mothers has a letter similar to this. Your boy knows that I will back your decision whether I agree with it or not (and that I will check what it is.)” He put it down.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’s telling you what to do. He just wants you to make an informed decision.”</p>
<p>She stared at him. “I can’t believe you’re ok with our child getting weapons lessons from a fucking assassin.”</p>
<p>“Would you prefer him to learn to kill from farmers?”</p>
<p>“WHAT!?”</p>
<p>“Livestock aren’t pets. Every farmer in the valley has more kills than the best assassin in the world. They’re stone-cold killers. They kill. Then they butcher, and after that they eat lunch.”</p>
<p>She stared at him like he’d shit on the rug.</p>
<p>Shorty realised he’d made a mistake. He changed tack. “Come with me.” He walked to the steel cabinet in which his security equipment went while he was off duty. “This is what I wear to work. Do you recognise this?” He popped the magazine and bolt out and handed it to her by the barrel.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a fucking gun. God, you really don’t see anything wrong with this, do you.”</p>
<p>Shorty sighed, containing his exasperation. “No, I don’t. Darling, I don’t talk about it because I don’t want to upset you, but antithesis are very bloody dangerous. Some of them can bite your face off. Some of them can turn you into a zombie when you brush against what looks like a cobweb. We’re a lot luckier than most clearing details; we have access to Vanguard medicine. We don’t have to fear the zombie worms, but even Forest can’t save you if it rips your head off. On more than one occasion the only reason I came home unhurt was Oleksiy’s firearm skills. So do I trust him? Yes. I do. But you are my son’s mother. I think Forest is right, maybe you could talk to Sissi, find out what he’s like when there’s no-one around who could stop him.”</p>
<p>Her face ran a gamut of emotions, frustration, anger, betrayal, fury. She stormed off and slammed the bathroom door, crying.</p>
<p>Shorty took a deep breath, picked up the letter, opened a beer and went outside to read it again and think.</p>

<p>Sheila didn’t speak to Shorty for the rest of the evening. But the next morning, she packed Aiden’s lunch, checked his boots, and drove him to the guest carpark outside Olesksiy’s home. </p>
<p>She parked a little way off, heart thumping, and watched the children gather at the gate, chattering and jostling, their faces bright with anticipation. There was a range set up in Oleksiy’s ten acre backyard. It was perfect for it, a gentle slope at first then rising steeply; a natural backstop for even the largest rounds. Sheila cynically wondered whether he’d <em>chosen</em> it for this purpose, then realised that if he had it was a very responsible choice.</p>
<p>Oleksiy was already there, setting up the targets with Forest and Shorty. Sophia, hair tied back, was among the students, her expression determined. Sissi appeared at Sheila’s side, offering a pair of bright pink earmuffs. “You’ll want these,” she said with a knowing smile. “It’s louder than you think.” </p>
<p>“What happened to the active silencer?” asked Forest.</p>
<p>Oleksiy didn’t quite glare at him. “Need for silence is past.”</p>
<p>Sheila hesitated, then took them, grateful for the small kindness. She stayed outside the fence, arms folded, watching as Oleksiy called the group to order. His voice was calm, his instructions clear. “Safety first. Always. You do not touch the trigger until I say. You do not point the weapon anywhere but downrange. If you do not listen, you do not shoot. Is that clear?”</p>
<p>A chorus of “Yes, sir!” rang out. The children lined up, boys and girls together, each taking a turn with the heavy automatics, the weapons mounted on sturdy tripods. Forest and Shorty moved up and down the line, correcting stances, murmuring encouragement, never letting their attention waver. The targets clanged and jumped as the automatics barked, but there was no chaos, just discipline, focus, and a strange kind of joy.</p>
<p>Sheila watched, uneasy at first, but as the lesson went on she saw the care, the relentless repetition of safety, the way even the smallest girl was given her chance, her hands guided, her confidence growing with every shot. Oleksiy adjusted the weapons for each child, sometimes swapping out for a lighter rifle, always explaining why. No one was left out, and no one was pushed beyond what they could handle.</p>
<p>Weapons stilled. The silence was deafening. An amber lamp spun a warning over one of the heavy guns. A girl darted forward but a gate slammed closed between her and the weapon. Autumn’s torso flickered into view under the warning lamp, her arms crossed, slightly disapproving. </p>
<p>Jeers from the other kids fell silent when Oleksiy boomed “SILENCE! It is a mistake and she will explain it to us, so that we may all learn.” He turned, voice softening. “Explain your error, little one. Tell us of the danger, and how you will make it safe.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t put the safety on. I will put the safety on and make sure there’s no round in the - the chamber. Um, do we remove the bolt from these?”</p>
<p>“We do not remove the bolt for belt fed weapon, is too complicated. This is why safety is so important. After that you make other mistake. Can you tell me what it is?” His face was earnest, inviting, encouraging.”</p>
<p>The girl bobbed, nodding. “I didn’t tell the range master before I went back to the weapon!”</p>
<p>“Very good. Range master, can she approach weapon?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, instructor. Lisa, make your weapon safe.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn opened the gate and Lisa secured her weapon proudly and returned to the class.</p>
<p>When it was over, Aiden ran to the gate, face flushed with excitement. “Mum! Did you see? I hit the target! Oleksiy says I’ve got a good eye. You’re the best, Mum, for letting me come!”</p>
<p>Sheila managed a smile, ruffling his hair. “I saw. You did well.”</p>
<p>Sissi squeezed her arm. “He good man. Protect.”</p>
<p>As Sheila waited by the gate, Aiden and Scott barrelled out, faces flushed, voices tumbling over each other. “Mum! Next week is heavy weapons training for the ground crew! Can we go? Please? Scott’s mum says he can go if I can go! It’s going to be awesome, they’re bringing out the big ones!”</p>
<p>Scott, barely pausing for breath, added, “Oleksiy said we might get to see the autocannon! And Forest said the ground crew gets to help set up the targets. Please, Mrs Fenaluci? My mum said she’d bring lunch for everyone!”</p>
<p>Sheila looked at the two boys, their excitement infectious, and couldn’t help but smile. “We’ll see,” she said, but her tone was softer than before. “Let me talk to the other mums.”</p>
<p>Aiden whooped and high-fived Scott, already planning next week’s adventure as they ran off to join the others.</p>
<p>Sheila watched the children gather their things, laughing and comparing stories, and felt something in her chest unclench. She wasn’t sure she liked any of it, but she could see the sense in it now. For the first time in days, she let herself breathe.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-35" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">The Age of Aquariums</h1>
<blockquote><p>“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”<br>— Chinese Proverb</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>The Patel family’s garage looked like an aquatic laboratory had exploded. Glass tanks lined every available surface, bubbling away with pumps salvaged from old refrigerators and aquarium filters that had seen better decades. Priya Patel adjusted the air stone in a 200-litre tank while her teenage son Arjun measured pH with strips they’d driven two hours to Toowoomba to find.</p>
<p>“The silver perch fry are finally feeding,” Priya announced, watching tiny translucent shapes dart between artificial plants. “But we’re losing too many to fungus. The water chemistry is still off.”</p>
<p>Tom Bradley looked up from where he was hunched over a notebook, sketching diagrams. “What if we’re thinking about this backwards? Instead of trying to make tank water perfect, what if we make spawning conditions that work in dam water?”</p>
<p>“Explain,” said Dr. Rajesh Patel, Priya’s husband, without looking up from the microscope where he was examining water samples. In his previous life he’d been a biochemist; now he applied that same methodical precision to keeping fish alive.</p>
<p>Tom tapped his pencil against the notebook. “Forest’s big dam has blueclaw, Murray Cod, and those guppies he put in for mosquito control. They’re all breeding naturally, but the survival rate is terrible because the fry get eaten or can’t find proper shelter. What if we build spawning boxes—protected environments within the dams where fry can develop safely?”</p>
<p>Arjun looked up from adjusting a heater. “Like giant versions of these breeding tanks?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Mesh to keep predators out but let water flow through. We control the environment just enough to give fry a fighting chance, then release them when they’re big enough to survive.”</p>
<p>Priya nodded slowly. “That... actually makes sense. We wouldn’t need perfect water chemistry, just adequate protection during the vulnerable stage.”</p>
<p>“The problem,” Rajesh said, finally looking up from his microscope, “is materials. We need UV-resistant mesh, proper spawning substrate, and timer-controlled feeding systems. The hardware store in Stanthorpe laughed at me when I asked about aquaculture supplies.”</p>
<p>Tom grimaced. “And anything decent is special order from Brisbane. Three-month lead times, minimum orders we can’t afford.”</p>
<p>“What about pH buffers?” Arjun added. “These test strips are the last ones in a hundred-kilometre radius. I called every pet shop between here and Toowoomba.”</p>
<p>Priya sighed, watching her silver perch fry dart through the water. “It’s frustrating. We know what we need. We can design systems that would work. But getting the basic supplies...” She gestured helplessly at the makeshift equipment around them.</p>
<p>Rajesh picked up a jar of water from one of Forest’s dams, holding it up to the light. “The mineral content is actually quite good. Trace elements from the granite, bit of clay. Once there’s a layer of leaf litter it’ll stop being murky. If we could just solve the survival rate problem, these dams could support serious fish populations.”</p>
<p>“Think bigger,” Tom said, his pencil moving across the paper. “We’re not just talking about Forest’s dams. Every property in the valley has at least one dam. Most of them are just muddy holes with a wild guppies and mosquitoes. And big, fat leeches.” He shuddered, then continued, “But if we could develop a system—spawning boxes, feeding protocols, population management — we could turn every dam into a productive aquaculture system.”</p>
<p>“Food security,” Priya murmured. “Protein production without depending on external supply chains.”</p>
<p>“And ecosystem management,” Rajesh added. “Proper fish populations would control insect larvae, reduce algae blooms, improve water quality overall.”</p>
<p>Arjun was getting excited. “We could have different species in different dams. Specialized systems. Some for eating fish, some for ecosystem management, some for breeding stock.”</p>
<p>Tom sketched rapidly. “The spawning boxes could be modular. Standard designs that work in any dam, but customizable for different species. Start with what we know works — silver perch, maybe some of the native species that don’t eat everything in sight — then expand from there.”</p>
<p>“If only we could get the materials,” Priya said, looking around at their jury-rigged systems. “Half of what we need doesn’t exist in rural Australia. The other half costs a fortune.”</p>
<p>Rajesh nodded. “It’s like everything else out here. We have the knowledge, we have the need, but the supply chains assume we’re in the city. And that’s before the government wants to know why you want it, and the tax department decides you’re running a business.”</p>
<p>Outside, one of Autumn’s bees hummed past the garage window, doing its endless rounds of data collection. The three aquaculture enthusiasts bent back over their tanks and notebooks, unaware that their conversation had been noted, analyzed, and flagged for attention.</p>
<p>In his workshop three kilometres away, Forest’s tools suddenly stopped making noise as Autumn’s voice filled his headset.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Forest, I think you should take a drive over to the Patel place. They’re working on something you’ll find interesting.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What kind of something?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The kind that solves several problems at once.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest looked at the half-assembled fence post driver he’d been tinkering with. “This better be good, Autumn. I was actually making progress on this thing.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Trust me. And wear your good shirt. You’re about to make some people very happy.</em></p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Twenty minutes later, Forest stood in the Patel garage, listening to Tom Bradley enthusiastically explain spawning box designs while Priya showed him tanks full of tiny fish that might or might not survive to adulthood.</p>
<p>“The concept is sound,” Forest said, examining Tom’s sketches. “And God knows we need better protein production. What’s the holdup?”</p>
<p>“Materials,” Rajesh said simply. “Specialized mesh, pH control systems, proper spawning substrate. Everything we need exists, but not in quantities or at prices that make sense for rural properties.”</p>
<p>Forest nodded. “Show me the list.”</p>
<p>Priya pulled out a notebook filled with part numbers, supplier contacts, and price quotes. “We’ve priced everything for a pilot system. Five spawning boxes, complete with feeding systems and monitoring equipment.”</p>
<p>Forest scanned the list. “Autumn, are you seeing this?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I am. Processing now.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>A pause.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Forest, would you like to hear something interesting?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Always.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The total cost for everything on this list, including shipping to rural Australia, is less than half what you spent on your last batch of practice targets. It’s all Class 0, so you don’t even need a catalogue.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Where do you guys want all this stuff? Is there enough space for all of it in here?”</p>
<p>The answer was no, so that turned into a working bee, which turned into an excuse to fell and mill.</p>
<p>“Suuuuure,” said Trixie. “This in no way relates to the ridiculous joy you take in swinging that chainsaw. It’s just a storage requirement.” She looked frostily at him. “You aren’t clearing perfectly good stringybark and there’s no more room in your ‘industrial area’.”</p>
<p>“Sure there is!” He left with the little tractor. In the bucket were fuel, chainsaw, spare chains and a winch. Periodically the tractor reappeared dragging a length of stringybark. A pile appeared over the course of the day in which the Patel boys spent more time outdoors than they had in the last month. Forest handed out gloves, and hardly anyone got hurt.</p>
<p>“This is insane,” Rajesh said, staring at the Lucas Mill. “This thing is awesome!”</p>
<p>Forest set it up mostly by himeself, occasionally asking them to hold things in place while he fitted bolts. Then three of them wrestled a trunk section onto the bed and Forest demonstrated the use of it. A horizontal cut, then a vertical cut. Piece by piece trees became lumber that was stacked in neat crosshatch piles to dry in the sun.</p>
<p>Trusting soul that he was, Forest used pickets and tarps to set up cover, then furled the tarps so the sun could speed things along. He asked them to come back every three days and turn the timber. This went on for three weeks and then they tried to build a shed. </p>
<p>The beams were heavy, still sappy. Forest changed his mind. It was taking too long. He cleaned out one of his shipping containers and used that instead. </p>
<p>“Righto, Autumn. Fish stuff please. On industrial shelving with nice labels.”</p>
<p>Points vanished silently, almost unremarked. Forest opened the container with a resounding clang.</p>
<p>“There you go, lads. Probably should have started like this. But I need more space, and so will you if this works out, so we’ll still build the shed.</p>
<p>The Patel boys said nothing in that polite way Indian people have. They actually weren’t put out. They’d had a lovely time milling timber with a madman, it was a curiously therapeutic thing to do.</p>
<p>Tom was sketching frantically, adding details to his spawning box designs. “We’ll need to select dam sites, prepare installation areas...”</p>
<p>“Leave that to me,” Forest said. “You focus on making sure the systems work. I’ll handle the logistics.”</p>
<p>As he walked back to his ute, Forest’s headset crackled.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That was well done.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest considered this. “Think it’ll work?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The fish farming? Almost certainly. But that’s not really the point, is it?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What is the point?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Food security is a matter of degree.</em></p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p><em>This is how communities develop when they have the resources to support innovation instead of stifling it. The Patels and Tom had the idea. You had the means to implement it. Now the whole valley benefits.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“And next time?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Next time, maybe it’s someone else with the idea and the Patels with the resources to help. Innovation supporting innovation.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest started the engine. “You planned this, didn’t you?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I noticed an opportunity and brought it to your attention. What you chose to do with it was entirely up to you.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Uh-huh.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I may have ensured that our conversation about fish genetics happened within range of my sensors while the Patels were discussing supply chain problems.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest laughed. “You’re getting devious in your old age, Autumn.”</p>
<p>She chose not to dignify that.</p>
<p>”“Explain it again? I don’t understand how they’re fixing the flow problem.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Most native Australian fish evolved in flowing water systems — rivers and streams. Their eggs need gentle current to stay oxygenated and suspended off the bottom where they won’t get smothered by sediment. In still dam water, the eggs just sink and die.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So the spawning boxes create artificial current?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Exactly. Tom’s design uses a simple venturi system. Water enters through an intake pipe positioned higher in the dam, flows down through the spawning chamber, and exits through a lower outlet. The height difference creates natural flow without needing pumps or power.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That’s... actually pretty clever.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The beauty is in the simplicity. The flow rate is gentle enough not to stress the fish but strong enough to keep eggs and fry healthy. And because it’s all gravity-fed, it works reliably without mechanical failure points.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What about during dry seasons when dam levels drop?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The intake can be mounted on a floating platform that adjusts with water level. Or multiple intakes at different depths. Tom has thought this through quite thoroughly.</em>”</p>
</blockquote><p>”“It sounds like my original plan to use solar pumps to lift water back to the top dam. What’s the difference?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Scale and purpose. Your pumping system would create flow throughout the entire dam - massive energy requirements to move thousands of tonnes of water. The spawning boxes only create flow within a small protected chamber - maybe fifty litres of water moving at any time.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So it’s more efficient?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dramatically. Plus your system would create turbulence that could actually harm developing eggs and fry. The spawning boxes provide exactly the gentle flow rate that fish biology requires - not too fast, not too slow.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“And the protective aspect?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That’s the real innovation. Tom’s system doesn’t just solve the flow problem - it addresses predation, water chemistry control, and feeding management all in one integrated solution. Your dam-wide flow would still leave fry vulnerable to every blueclaw and Murray Cod in the water.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So smaller, more targeted, more protective.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And scalable. You can install dozens of spawning boxes for less energy than running one dam-wide pumping system. Each box can be optimized for different species with different flow requirements.</em>”</p>
</blockquote><p>“So I’ve solved the problem by having people who know how to solve the problem. I’ve turned into a bloody manager. Kill me now.”</p>
<p>A long silence ensued. Eventually, Forest said “Instead of moving a shitload of water and using a filter that clogs all the time because high flow through fine mesh, he’s moving a small amount of water slowly and the eggs stay in the fine mesh enclosure miles away from the recirculation inlet.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Well done.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Why did these guys think of that when I didn’t?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s their hobby. They like thinking about it, and they have a lot of experience.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Right.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Also you’re a ham-fisted brute who likes explosions.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In a basement, Priya Patel dreamed with open eyes of reed and weed and flashing fins; in every dam a different fish. Gudgeon everywhere, mosquito killer and fish food extraordinaire. Perch in gold and silver, bass and catfish. And everywhere, <em>Cherax Destructor</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I have two children. One is forty, the other ten. Both smell of cordite. The large one is vexed that the small one is a better shot.<br>
&mdash; Sheila Fenaluci, Range Mother</p>
</blockquote><p>Time passed and things changed. The strange became commonplace and mothers became friends.</p>
<p>The pavilion was a riot of color — picnic rugs, thermoses, and a dozen pairs of industrial earmuffs, some neon orange, some battered and grey, one pair with daisies painted on the sides. Sheila slipped hers on, the world going deliciously quiet except for the distant, muted thud of the range.  </p>
<p>“You never get used to it,” one of the mothers said, passing her a sandwich. “The noise, the waiting, the nerves. The earmuffs help.”  </p>
<p>Through the binoculars, they watched their children — focused, careful, engaged. The mothers exchanged glances, a silent understanding passing between them. This was their new normal.</p>
<p>Scott and Aiden were halfway through their chicken and salad wraps when Lisa and Sophia marched up. The difference in size and poise between the technical boss of the entire terrestrial scientific presence in the valley, and a junior schoolgirl, did nothing to dispel the sisterly solidarity. “You found it, you tell ’em, kiddo.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t clean your rifles,” Lisa said, voice sharp. “They’re full of residue, I checked. That stuff is corrosive, you can’t leave them like that. If Autumn sees it, I would not like to be in your boots.”  </p>
<p>Scott’s face fell. “We were going to do it after lunch—”  </p>
<p>“You said that last week,” Sophia cut in. Lisa continued “And the week before. You want to shoot the autocannon, you’d better show you can look after the little ones first. I will be so pissed if I miss out because you two can’t be bothered.”</p>
<p>From the pavilion, a couple of mothers exchanged knowing glances. “Told you the girls would keep them honest,” one murmured, passing the binoculars. ”‘Girls,’ yes,” said the other. “I think your daughter is making some very interesting friends. I heard he was teaching them tactics and strategy. Politics too, apparently.” There was laughter, but it was muted and thoughtful.</p>
<p>Autumn’s voice boomed from the PA. “If you’re <em>quite</em> done with lunch, gentlemen, perhaps you could find time to look after your weapon. Otherwise it might blow up in your face.”  </p>
<p>The boys groaned, but grabbed their kits and hurried off, the girls trailing behind. Lisa with a righteous scowl, and Sophia with an amused smile.</p>
<p>The range was closed and Oleksiy was taking a break from his role as instructor. Over by the side of his house, he and Eric had a SPNKr dismantled all over a table and every student who wasn’t busy cleaning a weapon was peering wide eyed while they maintained it. It didn’t need maintenance, but there were no manuals so this was how you learnt; doing. Pieces in place, screws tight, it went into an oiled timber case with brass fittings that spoke of care. Down the side was hand painted Cyrillic lettering. Oleksiy followed his gaze and translated: “Says ‘Old Faithful’.”</p>
<p>The case snicked shut and it vanished back into the armoury. No-one wondered why there was an armoury. It wasn’t unique. The smell of machine oil and cordite reassured them.</p>

                <section class="body-content">
                    <h1 id="id-37" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Screw This</h1>
<blockquote><p>“The most ordinary things are to philosophers a source of insoluble puzzles.”<br>
&mdash; Bertrand Russell</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>How are screws made?</p>
<p>This was the question currently occupying Forest’s perennially overtaxed attention. He knew how to make one with a lathe, but obviously that was not the way of mass production. The valley had a voracious appetite for fasteners. Cubby-houses, then cabins &mdash; which are basically cubby-houses for adults. Sheds. Roofing. Flashing. Guttering. Water tanks sprouted like big plastic mushrooms. What idiot encouraged them to try their hands at building? Unfortunately, he knew the answer and couldn’t really complain about it.</p>
<p>They were getting smarter about it, too. Heavy red clay was everywhere under the topsoil, and one enterprising couple was making bricks. More than one couple was gathering granite rocks and boulders. Stone cottages rose from the ridges, little castles claiming the land in silent defiance. Red bricks accented doorways and windows, each with a sturdy steel or timber lintel spanning the opening. In one case, someone had made a custom brick mould and an arch was under construction.</p>
<p>He wondered how they were dealing with the soil. Clay swells or shrinks with seasonal moisture, a terrible foundation for a stone building. No doubt Oleksiy would have had advice. He really <em>was</em> a builder, among other things.</p>
<p>Curiosity got the better of him. Forest retreated to the mesh and started digging. It turned out that mass-producing screws was a marvel of industrial ingenuity. Most modern screws were made by cold heading: a coil of steel wire was fed into a machine that chopped it into short lengths, then smashed one end flat to form the head. The blank was then rolled between precision dies, which pressed the threads into the shank without cutting away any metal. This process was fast, efficient, and produced screws that were stronger than those made by cutting threads. Afterward, the screws were heat-treated for strength and coated to resist corrosion. There were endless variations—self-tapping, wood, machine, drywall—but the basic process was the same.</p>
<p>Forest watched a few old videos, marveling at the speed and precision. It was a far cry from turning a single screw on a lathe. He made a note to ask if anyone in the valley had ever tried making thread-rolling dies. It seemed like the sort of thing that would end up on his list, sooner or later. They <em>really</em> needed a smith. Or three. This was worse: they could probably make screws, but how the devil would they make the dies?</p>
<p>Then there was the question of passivation. Galvanisation was simple but then they needed a supply of zinc. And there was nothing “just” about painting them; paint was a whole other ball of wax. Bitumen was the simplest answer but there wasn’t any in the valley. There <em>was</em> tin and lead, so probably zinc, but that meant smelting. It was all too hard.</p>
<p>He fantasized about a world of villages, each specialising in some aspect of technology. Mining, smelting, glass work. They wouldn’t exactly trade, not in the money sense. They’d just give each other surplus, because people with too many oranges need screws, and a village can only use so many screws. It wasn’t a bad idea, really. But there was no way the state would mind its own business while they set up like that. </p>
<p>He imagined the ‘screws’ village mostly farming. In year four of their cycle, while their fields fallowed, they’d  make hardware, fed by stores propped up with gifts from other villages looking forward to a gift of hardware. Unlike the money driven world, people here were figuring out how to build things to last. He remembered an unfunny “joke” from a former life writing software: <em>There’s never time to do it right, but there’s always time to do it again.</em> A smile lifted his moustache. These people had found time to do it right. The irony was, they were all learning, so they’d probably also do it again. But better, which is what matters.</p>
<p>The range mothers tried their hands at pottery but it didn’t pan out, the clay wasn’t pure enough. So now their husbands were busy (re-)inventing a machine to turn it to running slop and sieve out the impurities. Their prototype worked and now they were figuring out continuous production.</p>
<p>Forest was very pleased about that; it deferred the need for glass.</p>
<p>That was the thing about the valley: nothing stayed impossible for long. Someone would mention a problem over tea. By the next week, three people would have half a solution and a fourth would be sketching improvements in the dirt. Progress was slow, sometimes maddening, but it was theirs. Every new tool, every clever fix, was a small act of creative defiance. We’re still here. We’re not done yet. </p>
<p>Forest found himself oddly hopeful. Progress wasn’t <em>really</em> slow. The <em>first</em> time humanity did this it took thousands of years. Maybe they’d never have a proper screw factory, or a glassworks. But they’d have something better: a place where people learned, adapted, and built for keeps. And if that meant doing it again, and again, and again — well, that was how you got good at anything worth doing.</p>
<p>It was a weird mix of high science and cottage industry. Boffins who’d never been outside in their lives were pulled into practical arguments. Dragged into the field to see problems <em>in situ,</em> consulted for their theoretical understanding. For the first time in their lives they were getting a certain kind of respect from practical people, something they’d always craved and never admitted. And their respect for the doers also ballooned. It was a virtuous circle.</p>
<p>The work was hard, the days long. No-one even noticed; they were having the time of their lives. Sitting on a roof, watching, Forest spoke to Autumn, “We’ve created a monster.” She responded by throwing mesh usage stats up on his visor. There were more hits on DIY fabrication than porn, and gaming traffic was almost non-existent. Forest could <em>hear</em> her grinning.</p>
<p>“They’re in sooo much trouble.” She knew who he meant, and didn’t respond to that.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do you know, we’ve had more injuries from construction accidents than antithesis combat?</em></p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>A few days earlier, Eric had come to Forest with a request for approval to use his Vanguard points for exotic ammunition. Normally, Autumn’s project points would have covered it, but demand was through the roof. The ground team had been relentless, scouring antithesis further and further afield, wiping out nascent hives as far away as Tenterfield. Forest was surprised they had the manpower to cover so much ground while still protecting the valley from its experimental hives.</p>
<hr>
<p>Three weeks earlier: a festive pavilion in the guest carpark outside Oleksiy’s home. The air was filled with the sharp crack-crack-crack of automatic weapons in burst mode, the sound bouncing up and down the entire valley. The mothers clustered around their thermoses, gossiping as they watched the distant figures on the range.</p>
<p>One mother, eyes wide, leaned in. “I can’t believe Mick is back on the front line already, after what happened.”</p>
<p>Another nodded, voice low. “He lost a chunk of thigh and — well, you know. Dogweed got him when their position was overrun. If the vehicle team hadn’t pulled them out, and Forest hadn’t been there...”</p>
<p>The conversation shifted, stories of Forest, Eric, and Oleksiy circulating — tales of their exploits, their no-man-left-behind attitude. There was admiration, even awe, in their voices.</p>
<p>One of the women, with a sly grin, said, “I’ll tell you what, Forest is looking better every year. All that running around, or is it the good food and fresh air?”</p>
<p>The almost-bereaved woman, smug, chimed in, “Oh, it’s the medicine. My man was back on his feet in two days. Standing at attention in three. And let me tell you, the first thing he did was scoop me up — just like that — threw me over his shoulder and carried me all the way to the bedroom. I didn’t think he had it in him, not after what happened.”</p>
<p>There was a beat, then laughter. “Standing at attention?”</p>
<p>She winked. “I was bow-legged for two days. Remember when I was ‘sick’?”</p>
<p>The group erupted in knowing giggles, the crack of gunfire punctuating their laughter.</p>
<p>“But does it still <em>work?</em>”</p>
<p>She put her hand around her still flat belly, face unbearably smug now. She’d just been to the infirmary to confirm. “Oh yes, it works alright.”</p>
<p>For a moment, the group was silent, then the congratulations came in a rush. Hugs, laughter, and a few mock-jealous groans. Someone promised to bring cake next week. Incredibly, this idea was rejected immediately; the kids had decreed that flour not sourced in the valley was unsafe and disgusting, astonishing their mothers with across the board rejection of bread and cake without a proper pedigree. The local substitutes were adequate thickeners but not yet a substitute for baking.</p>
<p>Another joked about starting a nursery for the next generation of ground team. The mood was bright, the camaraderie palpable, the sound of gunfire in the distance now joined by the cheerful noise of celebration. As the day warmed, Eric and Forest went shirtless. Mick too, they realised, as he replaced the targets. Many gazes lingered on the rippling muscle, speculating. Volunteers for front-line duty inexplicably went through the roof.</p>
<hr>
<p>“You’re pullin’ me leg.” Forest eyeballed Shorty, amusement lighting his face.</p>
<p>“Nup. Weren’t you always telling <em>me</em> the fundamental forces of the universe were stupidity, greed and horniness?”</p>
<p>“So no amount of logic worked but Mick swaps a keg for a six pack and we’re all go.”</p>
<p>“Yep. Well, not <em>just</em> Mick. Every time the sun comes out you buggers have yer shirts off at the kids’ range. Why d’yer think the mothers all turn up? You patched Mick up. He wasn’t bleeding when we took ‘im home but his missus, what’s her name, Jennifer or somethin’. She thought she was gunner spend the rest of her life lookin’ after a cripple. Nanites did what nanites do, and two days later he chucked her over his shoulder, carried her up the stairs and bonked her halfway into next week.</p>
<p>“Why do <em>you</em> know this?” Forest looked confused.</p>
<p>Shorty roared with laughter. “Mate, you must be the only person she <em>hasn’t</em> told. Pleased does not cover it. And my missus tells me she’s up the duff, too. Mick’s missus, not mine. I hope.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Forest recovered, “That’s one way to recruit, I s’pose.”</p>
<p>He changed the subject and brain-dumped the hardware problem on Shorty. </p>
<p>“We probably don’t need to smelt iron, there’s so much of it lying around. A decent smith can make billets. But then we need to make wire, which isn’t impossible. But you need tool steel dies to form the wire. How the bloody hell do we make <em>those</em>? I’m really starting to worry that it’s too much.”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you talking about a bunch of villages mostly growing food but also having a specialty and doing that in a fallow year?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“If we set up all that shit you were talking about we’d make them by the tonne, right? So in this hypothetical fallow year we make shitloads of screws, rack ‘em, pack ‘em and stack ‘em, and swap surpluses like you were on about.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“So the dies don’t have to be replaced all that often. How many screws do you think we <em>need?</em>”</p>
<p>“Shitloads. Take a look at how often people go into town for hardware. Even just a little deck, 2.4 square with ninety mil’ planks. If you do it to code there’s one every 400 which gives you seven joists hanging from the bearers. With a 4mm gap that’s 25 planks over seven bearers with two screws per intersection is fifty by seven is 350. There you go, 350 screws for a piddly little deck. Most of the cottages I’ve seen were more like four by ten metres which is about...” his mouth moved, silent calculation. ”‘Bout seven thousand screws.”</p>
<p>Shorty thought about that for a while. “I don’t reckon it’s normal. We’re all building stuff, houses and sheds. It’ll never stop, but it’ll switch from construction to maintenance, y’know. It’ll slow down a lot. Plus, I was looking at those links you gave me, the Amish. A lot of what they make doesn’t use screws, just nails and not a lot of those. It’s bloody clever stuff. I never thought I’d be saying this to you, but you’re thinking about this all wrong.”</p>
<p>Forest stared at him for a while. </p>
<p>“I reckon you might be right. Still worries me, though. We are buying a <em>lot</em> of hardware. It’s going to draw attention.”</p>
<p>A bee landed on Shorty’s phone, which flickered to life. Autumn’s voice lilted out of it.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Trixie wonders if you ever plan to empty the can.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“It’s only half-full, what’s her rush?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Tomorrow is Sunday. You are entertaining half the ground team.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Only half of ’em? I thought they’d all turn up for lamb on a spit.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Group 2 is clearing the hills around Glen Aplin.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Left the gate open, did we?”</p>
<p>Autumn sniffed. The phone went dark. It was amazing how she managed nuanced presence, even through a speaker.</p>
<p>“Right, I’m off.”</p>
<p>“Like a bucket of prawns in the sun.”</p>
<p>On his way home Autumn piped up in his visor.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Are you planning, at some point, to <strong>read</strong> any of the material in the Reboot catalogue that I so thoughtfully provided? You don’t need to work it all out yourself, you know.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yep. After I come up with a half-arsed plan that won’t work I’ll look at theirs and pinch the good bits. Then I can pretend I’m a genius.”</p>
<p>Never one to let anything as trivial as common sense get in his way, Forest continued investigating while he went home, learning about wire drawing. He came up with a plan for a simplified semi-manual simplification of the industrial process with wire running back and forth between two drums. With each pass you changed the die and the direction, producing finer and finer wire and periodically harvesting a desired gauge.</p>
<p>Autumn showed him a similar but fully thought out solution in one of the books in the Reboot catalogue. This did nothing to diminish his satisfaction with his own plan. If anything it tipped him over the edge from confident to flat out smug.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I really don’t see why you’re so pleased at having spent days fretting about this when you could have just read the book.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“The problem, Autumn, is what I like to call Roman Pot Syndrome. The Romans produced excellent ceramics. As the empire collapsed and shrank there was a surplus of fine ceramics that spanned generations. There was no value in learning to make what could be had for no effort. So the technology was forgotten. And one day there were no more surplus pots and no-one who knew how to make them. The catalogue is nice but reading about it in a book and doing it are very different. We are in dire peril of suffering Roman Pot Syndrome with things like screws and wire.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I would say this has <strong>already</strong> happened. You didn’t know, and you, Forest, are far more likely to be interested in this sort of thing than most.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I dimly recall learning about wire-drawing at school. Or it may have been university. It’s obvious that rolling the threads into wire would harden them. All the crystal boundaries get shoved together.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Knowing that is <strong>not</strong> normal.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Knowing that <em>wasn’t</em> normal in the screwed up, centralised nonsense I left behind. Look around us, kiddo. Look how much fun these people are having now that they’ve reclaimed their lives.”</p>

<blockquote><p>“There are no passengers on spaceship Earth. We are all crew.”<br>
&mdash; Marshall McLuhan</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Five-thirty in the morning, and the valley stirred to life with the soft rustle of feathers and the quiet determination of small voices organising their troops.</p>
<p>“Janna, the guinea fowl are being difficult again,” Lisbeth whispered, crouched beside the makeshift pen where thirty-odd spotted birds milled about in theatrical protest. “They don’t want to line up.”</p>
<p>“They never want to line up,” Janna replied with the patient tone of someone who’d been managing both children and poultry for decades. She adjusted the canvas sling across her shoulder, checking the dozen chicken eggs nestled in soft moss — payment for Mrs. Patterson, whose property they’d visit today. “That’s why we put them at the back. The geese know what they’re doing.”</p>
<p>Indeed they did. Six magnificent grey geese stood in perfect formation at the head of the procession, necks high, dark eyes alert. Behind them, two dozen ducks quacked softly in their own loose formation — mallards, wood ducks, and a pair of impressive Australian shelducks that Forest had traded for with someone down near the Murray. The chickens, sensible birds all, clustered in the middle, clucking with the businesslike air of middle management. And at the rear, the guinea fowl maintained their vigilant watch, heads turning at every sound, ready to raise the alarm at the first sign of anything unusual. Their constant chatter wasn’t complaining — it was reconnaissance.</p>
<p>“Right then,” said Marcus, all of eight years old and deadly serious about his responsibilities as assistant poultry marshal. “Everyone ready?”</p>
<p>Three other children nodded. Emma carried the backup grain sack, just in case. Little Sam, barely six, had been promoted to guinea fowl liaison after proving surprisingly effective at interpreting their warning calls. And Priya — Dr. Patel’s eldest — carried the observation notebook where they recorded which dams needed the most attention.</p>
<p>“Formation, march!” Janna called softly.</p>
<p>The procession began.</p>
<p>It was something to behold: Janna, with her practical salt-and-pepper pigtails and canvas work shirt, leading forty-seven children aged six to fourteen and over two hundred birds in a stately dawn parade through the valley. At the very front, just behind the lead geese, Lisbeth rode a patient brown goat named Clementine with the casual confidence of someone who had never doubted that goats were perfectly reasonable mounts. The geese, natural leaders, set a dignified pace down the dirt track toward the Patterson property. Their necks swayed with each step, and they maintained perfect spacing as if they’d drilled for this moment their entire lives.</p>
<p>Behind them, the ducks followed in a more relaxed gaggle, occasionally breaking formation to investigate interesting puddles or chase the odd insect. The chickens maintained reasonable discipline, though the rooster — a magnificent red fellow called Napoleon — occasionally felt compelled to crow his authority over the proceedings.</p>
<p>And the guinea fowl... well, the guinea fowl were on duty. Their heads swiveled constantly, scanning for threats, listening for unusual sounds. What sounded like complaints to untrained ears was actually a continuous security briefing. They noted the wind direction, catalogued every moving shadow, and maintained perfect situational awareness. But they followed anyway, because guinea fowl understand that the best defense is mobility, and staying with the flock was the smart tactical choice.</p>
<p>“There’s something magical about this,” Mrs. Patel said, watching from her kitchen window as the procession passed. She’d gotten up early to make extra tea for the children when they returned. “Like something out of a fairy tale. Is that child riding a goat?”</p>
<p>Her husband, Dr. Patel, paused in his morning routine to watch. “That’s Lisbeth,” he said with fond amusement. “And yes, she is. Practical magic,” he added. “Those birds will clear every tick, leech, and aquatic pest from the Patterson dam. Better than any chemical treatment, safer for the fish population, and the children learn responsibility and observation skills.”</p>
<p>“Not to mention,” Mrs. Patel added with a smile, “Janna’s really got those children organized. Did you see how she managed them? No shouting, not a raised voice. You’d think it would be mayhem.”</p>
<p>After a while she added, “I didn’t know you <em>could</em> ride a goat.”</p>
<p>“You can’t,” replied her husband sagely. “But neither Lisbeth nor the goat seem to know that.”</p>
<p>The procession crested the small rise that led to the Patterson property, where the old man himself waited by his gate with a thermos of hot chocolate and a gentle smile. The dams on his land had been overrun with leeches this season — something about the warmth and the abundant insect life. But the children and their feathered army would sort that out.</p>
<p>“Morning, Mr. Patterson,” Janna called as they approached. “Permission to deploy our pest control unit?”</p>
<p>The old man’s eyes twinkled. “Permission granted, Field Marshal Janna. The troops look in fine form today.”</p>
<p>And they did. The geese surveyed the terrain with professional interest. The ducks began an excited chatter as they spotted the water. Even the guinea fowl seemed marginally less outraged now that there was actual work to be done.</p>
<p>“Deployment pattern seven,” Janna announced. “Geese on perimeter patrol, ducks on aquatic operations, chickens on terrestrial cleanup, guinea fowl on security watch.”</p>
<p>The children spread out around the first dam — a lovely natural depression that had been deepened and lined to create a swimming hole and stock water point. Within minutes, the water was alive with activity. Ducks dove and dabbled, their bills perfectly designed for scooping up leeches, mosquito larvae, and all manner of aquatic pests. The geese patrolled the shoreline, their long necks reaching deep to pluck out hidden treats.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the chickens worked the surrounding area with methodical precision, pecking and scratching through the leaf litter and tall grass. Ticks didn’t stand a chance. Neither did beetle grubs, snail eggs, or anything else that might eventually become a problem.</p>
<p>The guinea fowl, despite their reputation for being difficult, proved themselves the elite reconnaissance unit of the operation. Spread out in a careful perimeter, they maintained constant surveillance of the surrounding bush. Their sharp eyes could spot movement from remarkable distances, and their varied calls provided a running commentary on everything from wind changes to approaching wildlife. When one bird tensed and issued a particular staccato call, every other creature in the vicinity paid attention.</p>
<p>“Look,” whispered Priya, pointing to where one of the larger geese had surfaced with something long and dark writhing in its beak. “That’s got to be a massive leech.”</p>
<p>“Gross,” said Emma, but she was writing it down in the observation log anyway. “That’s the fourteenth one this morning.”</p>
<p>Little Sam had discovered that guinea fowl, for all their intensity, actually appreciated being acknowledged for their vigilance. “Good watching, Dot,” he told one particularly alert bird positioned on a small rise overlooking the dam. “You’re keeping us all safe.”</p>
<p>The guinea fowl in question — a fine specimen with excellent spotted markings and exceptional alertness — seemed to straighten with pride before resuming her methodical surveillance of the tree line.</p>
<p>“You know,” said Marcus, watching the coordinated assault on the dam’s pest population, “I think we’re getting good at this.”</p>
<p>Janna nodded, making a note about the water clarity. Already, the dam looked cleaner. The constant activity of dozens of bills and beaks stirring up the water was filtering out algae and debris, while the systematic removal of pest species would prevent population explosions later in the season.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Patterson always gives us her excess vegetables,” Lisbeth observed, enthroned atop Clementine, who had positioned herself strategically near a patch of particularly sweet clover. “And her husband taught Sam how to weave that fish trap. It’s like we’re all helping each other.”</p>
<p>“That’s the point,” said Janna. “Autumn explained it to me once. She said that in healthy systems, everybody benefits when everybody contributes. The birds get an easy meal, the property owners get pest control, we learn animal husbandry and ecological management, and the whole valley ends up healthier.”</p>
<p>A soft splash drew their attention to where one of the wood ducks had caught a small fish — probably a plague minnow, based on the size and coloring. The duck gulped it down with obvious satisfaction.</p>
<p>“Should we be worried about the fish population?” asked Priya, ever the scientist’s daughter.</p>
<p>“Nah,” said Emma. “Forest explained this to us last month. The ducks and geese mostly get the pest fish and the sick ones. It actually makes the good fish healthier by reducing competition and disease pressure.”</p>
<p>As if to prove her point, a healthy-looking Murray cod surfaced briefly in the deeper part of the dam, completely unbothered by the avian activity above. It was probably contemplating eating the ducks. Or the children, if they fell in.</p>
<p>By eight o’clock, the first dam was comprehensively processed. The water ran clearer, the shoreline was meticulously cleaned, and even the guinea fowl seemed satisfied that the area was properly secured and threat-free.</p>
<p>“Right then,” announced Janna, “time to move to dam number two.”</p>
<p>The procession reformed with practiced ease. The geese took point again, the ducks fell into their loose formation, and the chickens resumed their middle-management clustering. The guinea fowl established their security perimeter with renewed purpose, perhaps energized by their successful morning patrol.</p>
<p>As they moved toward the second dam, Mr. Patterson waved from his porch. “Same time next month?” he called.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t miss it,” Janna called back. “Your dams will be the cleanest in the valley.”</p>
<p>The old man chuckled and disappeared inside, no doubt to put together another care package for the young pest control specialists and their feathered army.</p>
<p>Behind them, the first dam settled into peaceful clarity, its ecosystem temporarily reset and balanced. Ahead, dam number two awaited its turn for the attention of the most unusual and effective pest control service the valley had ever seen.</p>
<p>And somewhere in the mix, forty-seven children learned a little more of responsibility, teamwork, and the simple satisfaction of work well done. </p>
<p>There were many such days. In the middle of one such, Forest turned up with a gift: a hammock. Janna’s thoughts returned to a time when it was all too much. Lisbeth and Forest had just appeared. They did nothing in particular, just stamped their madness on the world, but everything changed. It crossed her mind that Hettie had warmed to Forest. Probably because Lisbeth liked him. It made as much sense as anything else about those two.</p>

<blockquote><p>So help me, cod.<br>
— Forest</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Scott was very pleased with his haul. </p>
<p>The Christmas before, Miss Priya convinced Forest to try putting spangled perch in with the Murray cod. </p>
<p>“What have you got against spangled perch?” Forest had said. “I’m not sure we should let anything smaller than <em>you</em> swim in that water, until I fish the last of the cod out.”</p>
<p>The cod were the most successful fish disaster since tilapia, but native. Forest assumed that since they were on the approved list they were a good idea. Apex predators, it was a wonder the damn things didn’t eat the ducks. They probably <em>did</em> eat the ducklings. The only things that survived in the same dam were the blueclaws, and that was only because they were fast, armoured, randy little buggers.</p>
<p>But Priya was always right when it came to fish, so he tried it. And the cod grew fat, but the perch bred like mosquitos. Sure enough, the girl was right. And then Forest caught the big one, triumphantly filleting it and scarfing fat, oily fillets grilled on open flame with big, crunchy oversalted chips that gave him gas but were too delicious not to eat.</p>
<p>If there was another cod in there, it wasn’t the monster, and the number and size of spangled perch boomed. The only problem was they weren’t the best table fish. The <em>flavour</em> was fine, but they were full of fine bones that were hard to see and harder to remove.</p>
<p>Ken dropped over to share a glass one afternoon and mentioned it to Forest. </p>
<p>“He was so disappointed, but what can you do? I told him that it’s a whole ecology in there, and not all of it is directly edible. He’s a good lad, he listens and he thinks. He’s been using them to bait the crays.”</p>
<p>Forest grinned that big, goofy, shit-eating I’ve-got-a-plan grin and filled their mugs, leaning back. Ken sensed the switch to tales-of-my-youth and settled to listen.</p>
<p>“I used to love fishing with my dad. One afternoon I was fishing off the back of his big boat.”</p>
<p>“How many boats did he have?”</p>
<p>“Two, at that point. A fourteen foot tinny and the big one, forty-five tonne displacement.”</p>
<p>Ken blinked. That wasn’t a powerboat. It sounded like a trawler. A large one.</p>
<p>Forest read his face and said “Floating restaurant. Three hulls, shallow draft. Anyhow, I caught this weird fish I didn’t recognise. Some of his trawler operator mates were aboard that afternoon and they told me it was a ‘shad’. Rubbish fish, they said. Too bony. Can’t sell em.</p>
<p>“When the cruise was over and the passengers gone, dad took me aside and said ‘You like roll-mops.’ It wasn’t a question, I did. He made them from time to time and I always loved eating them. So we got everything we needed from the restaurant supplies, rock salt, cloves, peppercorns, olives and some fine table salt. I scaled and cleaned it, cut fillets. Bream too, the shad wasn’t the only thing I caught. We washed the fillets in brine and rubbed more salt into them, rolled ‘em up and stuck ‘em with toothpicks.”</p>
<p>Forest pulled on his mead and leaned back again, the distant light of the world’s morning in his eyes. Ken said nothng. He was good at that, and Forest was often worth listening to, even if he did ramble.</p>
<p>“The old man found an industrial pickle jar that was nearly empty and we scooped out the pickles, julienned them and used them in the rolls. I might have told this a bit out of order, but anyway we kept the pickle vinegar and covered the bottom with rock salt. Stacked the mops around the jar till the layer was complete. Then we covered that with more rock salt, and cloves and pepper and even a bit of cinnamon. Then we did it again. And again, and then the jar was full so we added vinegar till all the fish was covered, and closed it, and put it in a cool dark cupboard for a fortnight.”</p>
<p>He sat up and looked at Ken.</p>
<p>“What do you reckon happens to fishbones in vinegar, Ken?”</p>
<p>A grin spread across Ken’s face. He wasn’t as uneducated as his manner suggested.</p>
<p>“They dissolve?”</p>
<p>“Bingo. It’s dead easy to do, just make sure you get all the scales off, or they’ll float off in the jar. Don’t skin the fillets, without the skin the mops’ll start to disintegrate. Pickles, olives, spices, whatever you think will suit his palate.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The next time he had scheduled down-time, certain that only the most dire of emergencies would call him to serve, Ken and Scott took their kit down to the dam with the spotted perch. </p>
<p>“Why are we <em>here</em>, dad? These ones aren’t good eating.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t they?”</p>
<p>Ken had cheerful mischief all over his face. It was infectious and Scott couldn’t wait for his dad to share whatever he’d discovered. </p>
<p>With plenty to eat and the monster from the deep long since converted to fish and chips, the little devils were fat and fearless, and the morning netted them a baker’s dozen.</p>
<p>Ken set up a trestle table with a tub of water from the dam, and cracked the esky. For the first time in Scott’s life it didn’t contain beer. There was lots of ice, as usual, but also big jars and a huge bottle of vinegar. They set up and industriously cleaned the fish. Ken was pretty handy with a knife, but he was proud to discover that his son wielded a filleting knife like a surgeon late for golf.</p>
<p>Rinsing the tub and refreshing the water further down where they hadn’t disturbed, Ken staggered back with it and set it on the table. </p>
<p>“Right, let’s mop this up.”</p>
<p>Scott recognised that special tone of voice used only for delivering a dad-joke and smiled, even though he didn’t get it. Ken laid out two clean cutting boards and a jar of toothpicks, the fancy kind that are thicker with a point.</p>
<p>“Lets do this together. Grab a fillet and some salt.” He opened a container of cooking salt and dumped a pile on the corner of each board. Make sure your hands are clean first. Give ‘em a wash.” </p>
<p>They went together, coming back to wave off the flies and get started. </p>
<p>“Rub the salt into the fish, not the skin side. No, don’t skin it. That’s it boy, good job. Nice and even. Now, Spices. We have pepper, cinnamon and cloves. You don’t have to use ‘em but these are what Forest suggested so I reckon we should do a few of each and give ‘em a whirl, what do you reckon?”</p>
<p>Scott nodded enthusiastically, sprinkling liberally. “Now what?”</p>
<p>“Now we roll it up and pin it.” He demonstrated, deftly rolling the fish into a tight cylinder and spearing it, glad for the practice up at Forest’s place. His first attempt had <em>not</em> been elegant.</p>
<p>Scott had a couple of tries, and finally he rolled and held it while Ken pinned it for him.</p>
<p>“Nice work, lad. Let’s do some more, but first we put them in here.” He poured rock salt into the bottom of a huge pickle jar and added some vinegar, placing his rollmop on its side and Scott’s beside, the lid sitting on loose to keep the flies out.</p>
<p>On they worked, side by side for an hour, Scott’s efforts getting firmer and faster. He also took over placing them in the jar, his small hands and nimble fingers well suited to the task. More rock salt and spices between layers. Halfway through the second layer Ken remembered he brought gherkins, and they wound around chunks of those. Then the jar was full. The last layer of salt went on, and they topped up the vinegar and closed it tight.</p>
<p>It took a while to wash the stink of fish guts off, and pack all their kit. Finally they walked home. Walking home together in silence wasn’t new, but this time it was warm and companionable. Scott couldn’t look at his dad. He didn’t want him to see the glistening emotion in his eyes.</p>
<p>When they got home his mum was in the kitchen getting a drink of water. Ken deposited the esky on the table and nodded toward it with a conspiratorial wink to Scott, who fished out their creation and proudly showed it to her, a torrent of happy explanation of rollmops and the chemistry of food preservation. The irony was completely lost on him of telling this sort of thing to a founding member of the range mothers, latter-day world champions of grow it yourself, and she made no move to spoil the moment, listening intently and nodding sagely at every step. Ken put his hand on her shoulder, kissed her cheek and wandered outside with a stubbie.</p>
<p>“Would you like a ginger beer, Scott?”</p>
<p>In the fridge she found only five and the smile already on her face spread wide. </p>
<p>“Come on then,” she said, opening the sliding screen door and stepping out of the the tiny demountable home onto the covered deck. Scott closed the door behind them. His mother handed him a cold ginger beer and startled both of them by sliding into Ken’s lap and kissing his stubbled cheek.</p>
<p>“It’s good to have you back.”</p>
<p>Ken sniffed. He put his arms around her and clasped his fingers. With a bemused look on his face he replied.</p>
<p>“It’s good to be back.” He got a thoughtful look on his face. “A better place...”</p>
<p>“You like it here, babe?” he asked her.</p>
<p>“You know I do. It’s funny, when we came here it was, I thought it was awful. Like a caravan park in the arse end of nowhere. But now I don’t like leaving. And when I went into Brisbane to see mum... I never realised how much cities <em>smell.</em> Not fart stinky, more like car fumes. And everyone’s rushing to places they don’t want to be. People aren’t <em>bad,</em> they just don’t have time to be friends.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “Yes, I like it here. Why?”</p>
<p>“I think we should build a home.”</p>
<p>“Build a house?”</p>
<p>“Build a home.”</p>
<p>She kissed him again, this time on the lips, and leaned back against his chest, eyes closed.</p>
<p>“Who are you and what have you done with my parents?” deadpanned Scott, in a passable imitation of Forest. He took a pull on his ginger beer and sat against the wall beside them.</p>
<p>“Guess we’re going to do a lot of bushwalking then.”</p>
<p>“Bushwalking, Ken?”</p>
<p>“Pick a site.”</p>
<p>“I thought all this land was privately owned.”</p>
<p>“It is.” Air-quotes went up either side of his girl and in a mock Forest voice, “I am the Lord of this land, holding title in Fee Simple”. </p>
<p>She giggled.</p>
<p>“He and Oleksi and the pig lady and that old feller, Brian. And Gerry, you know the feller who does the lawns here, him. Between ‘em it’s about five hundred acres. At one point most of it belonged to Oleksiy and Gerry, but Oleksiy sold some off, who knows why that man does what he does but I’m glad he did because here we are. I quote ‘Find a good spot, tell me where you want and I’ll tell you whether you can build there.’”</p>
<p>“What about the council?”</p>
<p>Ken actually roared with laughter. When he got control of himself again, “I would <em>love</em> to watch a council try to tell a Vanguard he can’t build a house on his own land. Especially one who’s well liked.”</p>
<p>“You, buster, are not a Vanguard.” She poked him in the chest. Her tone was stern but her face gave it away.</p>
<p>His face got silly. “I know a guy who is.” Then his straight face said “Actually I know three of them. Being on the ground team has advantages.” He flipped up the storage bench beside them and pulled out his webbing, extracting the medkit, tossing and catching it. “When we did the joint exercise at Dalveen with the SES, you should have seen their faces when we did a kit check and they saw the nanite inhalers. I almost felt guilty.”</p>
<p>“What’s the significance of it?” She took the kit out of his hand and opened it, looking at the inhaler in its bag.</p>
<p>“Those things are why it’s so hard to kill Vanguard. They snort one of them and grow a new lung. After we lost that lad, Forest got real bent out of shape for a few days and then Eric and Sophia turned up with a wheelbarrow full of this stuff. She reckons all he said was, ‘No more body bags.’”</p>
<p>“That was good of him.”</p>
<p>“You’re not kidding. If I sold this thing we could buy a house in the city with cash. A small place, not too flash.” he amended. “There were a few other goodies, all things to mitigate casualties. But the nanites are,” he searched for words, “Not even special forces get kit like this. She never talks about it but I gather the boss got a lot of heat when she wouldn’t bag em up and hand em over.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Officially? ‘The Vanguard in question gave them directly to the individuals on the fire team as an apology for failing to arrive in time resulting in the death of one of the team members.’”</p>
<p>She grinned. “And the real reason?”</p>
<p>“I reckon she didn’t like their attitude. Best boss ever,” he said, with genuine affection. Then he remembered they had an audience and looked down to Scott. </p>
<p>“I know you aren’t silly, just checking, you know not to tell people we have this kind of thing, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, dad. But everyone who goes to the range knows about inhalers, Oleksiy has two of them in the range medicine cabinet. He made us learn where it is and how to use one. I can’t think of anyone I talk to who wouldn’t already know, but yeah, don’t mention it to strangers. I get it. People who don’t live here have weird values, they’d rather have money than a second chance.”</p>
<p>“Figures,” said his mum. “Safety safety safety, that’s our superspy.” She squirmed against Ken, hand diving into his pocket and pulling out the hard lump of his issue small arm. “I <em>know</em> you’re glad to see me, but really?”</p>

<p>“Haaaaaang on, help is one the way!”<br>
&mdash; Air Supply</p>
<hr>
<p>The people of the valley may have walked away from life in the system but they kept an untrusting eye on it at all times. When they felt like it, satellite uplinks gave them news and streaming media of every stripe. So when Glen Innes copped an incursion they knew about it straightaway. </p>
<p>For most of them this went in one ear and out the other. It wasn’t actionable. It was distant. And it was just some antis. Antithesis were <em>always</em> around. Sometimes they got out, so you made sure you were armed, and if anything happened you called Eric, who sent a ground team, or Forest or Oleksiy.</p>
<p>This blas&eacute; attitude failed to consider that for others, the threat fell from the sky instead of coming from a predictable direction. It also didn’t consider that most places didn’t have a response team, or researchers who carried Class I weapons as part of their day job, or a resident Vanguard dispensing miracle medicine. Certainly not for a population in the low hundreds. To some extent this mindset was a natural extension of the culture that created Forest. Australia was always infamous for its danger-close nature; spiders, snakes, sharks, crocs, and a cute little octopus with a deadly bite. Even some of the plants try to kill you. Mortal peril was omnipresent. You learnt to deal with it &mdash; as a child.</p>
<p>Sophia was just about the last person in the valley to find out about Glen Innes. It was Eric who brought it to her attention in a summary of national antithesis activity. He was rocked back on his heels by the strength of her reaction.</p>
<p>Her parents, it seemed, lived there. This was not the problem. The <em>problem</em> was that Glen Innes was five and a half hours away from forces capable of suppressing an incursion and wasn’t economically significant. She knew exactly what the official position would be, what they would say, think and do. By the time anything was done about it her parents would be compost. This would be quite deliberate. It’s much simpler when there are no survivors, you drop a whopping big thermobaric bomb and when the fire goes out you dig out and kill anything that’s left.</p>
<p>She pulled the Bat-Phone, as Eric liked to call it, from a drawer. It wasn’t actually a phone, it was a UHF radio. She pressed the call button. <em>Bee-dunk!</em> </p>
<p>Twenty seconds later Trixie’s voice came through. “Handset seven...” paper rustled, and there was scrabbling, like looking for something in a draw. “<em>Sophia?</em> What’s up? He’s down at the low dam. Do you need him?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” It was almost a whisper, full of need and worry.</p>
<p>“Where are you?”</p>
<p>“My office.”</p>
<p>“Stay there. He won’t be long.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Down at the low dam, Forest and Oleksiy were wrestling a pump off a pontoon. Squelching out of sucking clay with fifty kilograms of rusty steel between them, they staggered onto the dam wall and set it down. Uncoupling inlet and outlet, they heaved it into the loader bucket of a small tractor with a clang. </p>
<p>Trixie was on the balcony of the southeast cabin waving a radio. “There’s a call for you.”</p>
<p>He looked at Oleksiy. “Duty calls.”</p>
<p>“No problem. I use the logging road, put in my shed. Maybe start tomorrow. See you later.”</p>
<p>He stumped down the hill, took the radio, thanked Trixie and pushed Transmit. “Forest.”</p>
<p>“I need help. Where’s your helicopter? Is it ready to fly?”</p>
<p>“Where are you?</p>
<p>“My office.”</p>
<p>“It’s in Oleksiy’s yard. He’s been servicing it. He likes to be ready.”</p>
<p>Her voice was quiet, unhappy. “Good.”</p>
<p>“Get down to Oleksiy’s with whatever you want to bring. I’ll meet you there.”</p>
<hr>
<p>She pulled in a little too fast, bursting out of the car and grabbing a duffel bag from the back seat. The cockpit of the Gally was open and Forest leaned comfortably on the ladder. He stood and took the bag from her hand, gesturing up the ladder.</p>
<p>“Get comfortable while Autumn and I do the pre-flights.”</p>
<p>The presence drone floated along beside him, Autumn prompting each check and Forest performing it and calling out the result. By the time he hoisted and stowed the ladder she was strapped in and wearing a helmet for the integrated headset. Styled after the original Russian gear, they were Class I tech with formidable noise rejection and very comfy. She adjusted the strap and put on her harness, settling back while switches thunked and those beautiful big turbines thundered to life.</p>
<p>Clear of the trees, Forest flicked the intercom on. “This is your captain speaking. The skies are clear and sunny. We’re still gaining altitude, and today’s in-flight entertainment will be explanations. Starting with a destination. Toward the end of the flight our cabin crew may hand out weapons, of which we have a splendid selection of high quality options. Over to you.”</p>
<p>“Glen Innes. Hurry!”</p>
<p>“Rightio, give me a tick. Autumn, that’s a one-horse town on the Newell Highway, can you give me the coordinates?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s on the New England Highway, not the Newell. I’ll take care of it, Forest. Go up to two thousand metres and engage the autopilot. Then talk to the lady, she’s clearly upset. Sophia, our flight time will be about one hour. We’ll be doing about 150 knots in a straight line</em></p>
</blockquote><p>In the air she poured her heart out to them, that her parents were there and how she <em>knew</em> the government wouldn’t help them. Her composure broke and there were tears. He nodded and let her talk. When she finally fell silent he reached back and put a hand on her knee. </p>
<p>“We’re on our way. Autumn, what intel do we have on ground conditions?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Six hours since the breach. These country towns aren’t fortified but if the people are anything like <strong>you</strong> the antis are probably in shock.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Hilarious. So they’ve been munching on the shrubbery for six hours and by now they’ve probably found the fertiliser section of a produce store.”</p>

<p>“Now you know why they call us the Vanguard.”</p>
<p>“Us?”</p>
<p>“You’re here, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Vanguards have space guns and magic medicine.”</p>
<p>He handed her an M40-AR.</p>
<p>“And body armour that works.”</p>
<p>“Autumn, we have about thirty minutes before we put down. I think it’s time you took the lady shopping.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It would be my pleasure.</em></p>
<p><em>Sophia, I’m going to hijack your augs, if you’ve never experienced full immersion you might want to sit down first.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sophia was already seated, there being no other choice in the gunnery seat, but she understood. Autumn gave her some privacy by isolating her headset. Faces, however, cannot be isolated. Sophia’s gave a new, more pleasant meaning to ‘shock and awe’. Fifteen minutes later Autumn announced a spend of 1209 points. Forest nodded. Boxes appeared in Sophia’s lap and her whole face lit up as she opened them.</p>
<p>Forest stopped rubbernecking the unboxing when Autumn piped up.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What happened to “I want to fly my attack helicopter”?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“The disappointing thing, Autumn, is that he’s more interested in my new toys than watching me undress.”</p>
<p>He snorted, because it was true.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, “Come on, tiger, check out the goodies.” She put one hand on the top of the bubble and mock twirled. “Supple but shock-stiff, with magnets for weapons and magazines.</p>
<p>“<em>Autumn!</em>,” he subvocalised, “Why have you dressed her up like that?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” fretted Sophia, “Do I look silly?”</p>
<p>“No, you look hot. Distractingly hot. Think Black Widow. Frankly, I think the little minx does it on purpose.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really?” she preened, unconsciously taking a deep breath that strained against the figure-hugging armour. The inappropriateness of this struck her so she channelled the primness of her inner Karen, bleeding unexpected tension out of the air. Relaxing, she smiled again: “Check this out!” She tossed her head like a shampoo model showing off her mane, and a full-face helmet erupted from the high collar.</p>
<p>He chuckled, “Now you look like Spiderman.”</p>
<p>He put down in the showgrounds: big and open, lots of visibility around them. Not so deftly as Oleksiy might have, but a far cry from the bouncing roughness of his first tries. Switches flicked as Autumn rattled off shut-down procedures. The turbines spun down and the canopy popped. He put the ladder out and slid down. She sat there a moment, thumb caressing the safety cover as she remembered another day. How shocked she’d been when a man she didn’t trust threw away a house-priced missile to solve a problem that was hers.</p>
<p>She thought about her parents, and all the others who lived here, and how the system she once served would ineluctably view them as acceptable losses. “Once served” woke her from the reverie, mouth a self-scandalised O.</p>
<p>Then she flowed out of her seat, pulling on the forward chairback to spin on one foot. The other pirouetted up and out and down to the ladder. She felt stiff in her new armour, festooned with weapons and magazines that seemed to catch on everything, but did not show it.</p>
<p>“How do you move in this stuff?”</p>
<p>“You get used to it.”</p>
<p>“How would you know? I don’t think I’ve ever seen you wear anything other than that filthy lumberjacket.</p>
<p>They hit the ground but did not run. </p>
<p>“Has it changed much since last you were here?” Forest threw his battered leather hat in the air and a swarm of Autumn’s bees erupted out of it, spreading as they rose.</p>
<p>“Not that I can see from here.”</p>
<p>As the bees built out their tactical map, Autumn simplified it. Irrelevant detail vanished. She highlighted potential threat locations. Thin walls and grates mostly, hedges and other places suited to ambush concealment. The bees found a likely shelter, with crowds of dog-weeds, stego-bears and even two of those centipede digger transport things. </p>
<p>“Sophia, eyes up. We can bolt back to the Galya, or ask Autumn for an M247H.”</p>
<p>“A what?”</p>
<p>“Machine gun. Eyes up!” he pointed as they blotted out the sun.</p>
<p>She did the hair flick thing and her face vanished behind armour.</p>
<p>He chuffed with amusement. “Autumn, an M247H each please, overlapping arcs against that wall under the eave.” </p>
<p>They bolted across the open expanse in the middle of the showgrounds to a pavillion. </p>
<p>“You told me this was a <em>small</em> town!” Forest’s voice was amused.</p>
<p>“It is! You live in a tiny valley. Have you ever been to Sydney?”</p>
<p>“Couple years in Melbourne, Sydney. Paris, for a while.”</p>
<p>She realised he was serious and let it go.</p>
<p>Rather than boxes, the tripod mounted guns were draped under silky grey cloth, like sculptures awaiting revelation. Autumn’s theatrical streak was out in force.</p>
<p>Leaning into the moment, Forest took Sophia’s hand and led her to them. He whisked back a cloth to reveal a spanking new M247H, already loaded with belt-fed ammunition from the ammunition box beside it. New brass gleamed its oily promise of mayhem. She placed her hands on the handles as he showed her the safety.</p>
<p>“You’re hot!” he said, flicking it off.</p>
<p>“So I’m told.”</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes, smiling, and readied his own. Clouds of murder-pigeons hove into focus and they both let fly.</p>
<p>“Short, controlled bursts. You don’t want a cook-off.”</p>
<p>His visor’s active noise-cancelling brought the earsplitting racket down to a dull roar. “Autumn, hearing protection for Sophia?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>What do you take me for? It’s in the helmet.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“She got a HUD?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Make sure she has a barrel heat indicator like mine. I don’t want to stop shooting to unjam her.”</p>
<p>The pigeons were faster than he remembered. The hail of fire thrown up by combined fire tore through the oncoming clouds, each round tumbling its gory way through half a dozen of the massed monsters. Mostly this threw them away, but one flew in, striking his visor and smearing it <em>red</em>.</p>
<p>“Interesting. And they smell different too. Now I know why they’re faster. These ones are using h&aelig;moglobin.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t everything?”</p>
<p>“Antithesis mostly bleed green. I don’t know why. It makes no sense to have chlorophyll in blood, it has to be cuproglobin, which is way less efficient.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Sophia, certain her boffins would have tried to tell her this at some point. She wondered what else they might have said that she ought to know in the field.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They could also be using myoglobin, which is the same colour as h&aelig;moglobin for all the same phys-chem reasons. But it’s not likely; Myoglobin bonds so strongly to oxygen that it works better as a store of oxygen than a transport.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“See that road out there?” She pointed. “It’s Bourke street. We should go that way. It goes into town. That’s where I’d put a shelter.” She stalked through the streets with unerring precision, Forest a half step behind. Charging hordes of single digit antithesis, swept aside like chaff before a storm as the pair took turns rolling swizzle sticks and bongos before them. A centiloader stared dumbly at them, dog-weeds stuffing mangled chickens and half a rottweiler into it.</p>
<p>In lock-step they armed and rolled grenades forward, dropping low to the ground as the fraggers tore off three of its legs. One of the three-eyed mongrels around it flung high and landed beside Sophia with a wet smack. Feebly, it snapped at her but they were on their feet and moving.</p>
<p>At Church street they found the shelter. It was sealed, a good sign. She asked, and Autumn linked them in; surprisingly the commercial networks were still up. Forest tossed her the SPNKr. She caught it with one hand, the suit lending her strength, and shouldered it while he contacted those inside. The recently incarcerated were surprised and delighted. They’d fully expected to spend another week inside with no real prospect of rescue.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We have company!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn faded everything in her visor but a patch of vegetation hanging from a balcony garden-box. Something about it didn’t look right.</p>
<p>“Is there anyone up there?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If there is, they’re having a very bad day.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“They certainly are.” Sophia unholstered her pistol and stood the way Oleksiy drilled into her, on the green-house cum firing range behind his house. She put two rounds into the not-right plant... which yanked back. Running up the bonnet of a parked car, she leapt onto the roof of the van behind it and jumping as high as she could. With the help of the suit this was about four metres off the ground. She caught the edge of the balcony and hauled herself up. A dog-weed bit her in the face, double hinged jaw failing to find purchase on her helmet. With one hand she pulled it off and flung it down to Forest where the edge of a bolted down rubbish bin broke its fall and its back.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>For a moment there I thought you were going to use the SPNKr!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Are you kidding? The cinema has been here since I was a kid. That would be an appalling thing to do.” Scanning left, right, and unlike the Alien movies, up, Sophia also departed from cinematic tradition by telling Forest what she was planning. </p>
<p>“I’m clearing the cinema. There was a Model Four on the balcony, I’ve gone in that way. I’m going up to the roof. Can you come in from the ground floor and meet me in the middle?”</p>
<p>“Cinema? It looks like a church.” Forest turned back to the console. “Sit tight in there, we aren’t done clearing. Autum, cheer ‘em up with some fruit juice and beers, whatever.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Party platters for forty, with drinks, three points. Done.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Does the Black Widow suit have a bodycam?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No, we didn’t think of that. But if she agrees I can stream from her augs.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Do that. Can you do it from my visor too?” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>I’ll have to rewrite the firmware.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“You’re going to keep them company and stop them from getting bored. It’s also good PR. This is your chance to make an action flick. Reckon you’re up to it?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Does a bear shit in the woods?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“I don’t know. We don’t get bears in Australia.”</p>
<p>Not for the first time, Autumn wished she had eyes to roll.</p>
<p>The power was on, so Forest’s charge at the cinema doors ended with them opening and him shooting through at full tilt and face-planting on the stairs.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Action-comedy! My favourite!</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Picking himself up, Forest decided there was no point asking her to edit that out. </p>
<p>“Guess the power’s still on.”</p>
<p>The lights died. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>Tell me again about your fabled luck.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“This place have a basement or am I at the bottom level?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>No basement. But there’s a store-room under each of the big screens, of which there are two. Doors are to the right of the screen from the audience point of view.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>His visor in night-vision mode, Forest checked both. They were clear. Something fell wetly on his shoulder. Seizing and crushing it, he pulled the nun-gun from a pocket and lit up the ceiling. When the fire started to spread, he followed with another, strikingly similar tool. This one threw a sticky extinguisher foam, a lesson from the last time he set a ceiling on fire.</p>
<p>“Autumn, open channel. Sophia, did she tell you&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Zombie worms. They’re disgusting and they scare me. That’s why this thing has a full closed helmet and a rebreather.”</p>
<p>“Take a seven pill anyway when we get clear. Autumn, distribute them in the shelter. Make it clear that if anyone doesn’t take one the lot of them will be quarantined for 24hrs.”</p>
<p>Forest swept the seating area, then checked the projectionist booth. Nothing. Moving to the other theatre also turned up nothing until he got to the booth. Inside it was obvious the projectionist hadn’t heard the alarms. He stood, deathly still and eyes unfocussed. </p>
<p>“Aw, shit.”</p>
<p>The projectionist locked onto Forest and shambled straight at him, jaw slack and movement staccato. Forest pulled the Trenchmaker and with a single shot everything from the eyes to the neck vanished in a messy spray. To avoid being sick he deflected his own attention, searching for more threats. He glanced at the floor where the top of the head still rocked. Half a worm hung out of it, twitching.</p>
<p>He continued to stare at it. Zombies were the worst. Autumn said there was nobody home, but he always wondered.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Snap out of it, Forest. You’re making things better.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Am I?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If nothing else you made my life easier. All the people who “refused to be coerced into medication” after “all that COVID nonsense” have changed their minds and formed an orderly queue.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Three earsplitting blasts rattled his brain in quick succession. Rat-poo and dust took over the cinematic duty of masonry and rained briefly from the ceiling. Forest vaulted up the stairs, three and four at a time, crashing out onto the flat metal roof where Sophia stood, wrapped in cut-off tendrils. She looked spooked.</p>
<p>“I was climbing over a garden bed and it tried to eat me. It couldn’t get through the suit but I couldn’t breathe properly.”</p>
<p>“You’re going into shock. Autumn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Suit says the same. Drink this.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Where’s mine?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Greedy boy. Two points. It’s lunch time anyway.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>He nodded. Two boxes appeared. Sitting on the ground, he started in on lunch, gesturing to Sophia to join in, a constructed normality. Slowly, she did.</p>
<p>“It’s good.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it is.”</p>
<p>They finished eating in silence.</p>
<p>Sophia felt steadier when they left the building. This time the power was out and they had to use a fire exit.</p>
<p>Clearing the block, this time together, they ran into implausibly few antithesis. </p>
<p>“It’s odd, but there are a couple of possibilities. None of them are fun. Sometimes they all run off because there’s something good to eat, like maybe they got into a shelter or found the fertiliser section of a hardware store. Sometimes they all run off because something with brains is in charge.”</p>
<p>“Autumn, do we know where the other shelters are?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, but if that’s it then you’re too late anyway.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So we assume that either they found fertiliser&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Bad.”</p>
<p>”&mdash;or something smart is setting us up.”</p>
<p>Back at the shelter vault door, they decided to let people out for the sake of morale. Let them ogle the damage, then send them back inside with a few basic arms just in case, to be left in the vault as city emergency equipment.</p>
<p>The vault console was still up; it ran off the network. “Righto, the immediate block is clear. We figure you’d probably like to get out for a bit, see the sun, stretch your legs.” With a dull thunk dogs released. High pitched beeps indicated it would open, so they stepped back. </p>
<p>Thirty or forty people streamed out into the sunlight. Sophia hadn’t realised how quiet the place had been before the shelter opened. </p>
<p>The valley wasn’t like this. It was alive but more ... intimate. Mostly. When they all got together it halfway between a barbecue and a festival, raucous and happy. She’d thought of Glen Innes as home &mdash; it never changed, so it had been her rock, a symbol of stability in an ever-changing world. But it wasn’t any more. With a shock she realised the <em>valley</em> was her true home, the only place she felt safe and whole. The thought of another call from the man she now regarded as her handler filled her with dread. She couldn’t keep living two lives. And that meant a reckoning.</p>
<p>Into this moment of revelation burst her parents, alive and well.</p>
<p>“Sophie, we thought you had an office job in Sydney! And what is that <em>outfit?</em> It doesn’t look like any government uniform <em>I’ve</em> ever seen. Who is that man? He looks like he’s talking to someone but he’s talking to the air.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly, Miriam, he’s probably on the phone.”</p>
<p>“Look at his eyes, Arthur. He thinks he’s talking to someone here.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He is. I’m projecting into his visor, it’s too bright out here for my presence drone.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Oh, the blue lady with the nice food&mdash; <em>Sophia Hachia, have you been hanging about with a Vanguard? They’re reckless, I thought I raised you with more sense!</em>”</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off as her eyes drifted back to Sophia’s outfit, widening.</p>
<p>“Sophia, are <em>you</em> a Vanguard?”</p>
<p>A child escaped her parents and appeared between them. “Miss, are you making a movie? My brother says you are but he’s full of shit, there’s nothing on the mesh. You’re really pretty though!” The alleged brother and nameless cohorts closed around them.</p>
<p>“Yes she is! Miss, you look just like Black Widow! Is there a new movie?” He stuck his tongue out at his sister for being such a party pooper.</p>
<p>Sophia smiled a strange almost inner smile and tossed her hair. The helmet erupted and so did the kids, delighted squeals as entertainment arguments broke out. They ran off.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Your daughter was concerned that the official response might not be fast enough. She was worried about you.</em></p>
<p><em>Sophia is Project Liaison for an antithesis research project that Forest and I run. The nature of the project is such that we deal with live antithesis more or less continuously. Your daughter has grown from a desk jockey to a minor force of nature.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Does that make him a <em>major</em> force of nature?” her father cast an amused glance at Forest.</p>
<p>“Don’t say that, he’ll get a big head.” Sophia recovered her poise.</p>
<p>Forest spoke for himself, as was his wont. “She organises... everything, really. Like I told her when we met, I just dig holes and carry stuff. And shoot things.”</p>
<p>Sophie’s mum sidled over to the presence drone and whispered “Are they an item?”</p>
<p>Forest was only deaf when it suited him. “I’m way too old for her and I already have a life partner. Sophia and I just get each other out of trouble from time to time.”</p>
<p>“As for whether she’s a Vanguard: walks like a duck, quacks like a duck...”</p>
<p>“I am not a Vanguard! Vanguards are chosen by the Protectors. They have access to advanced alien tech&mdash;”</p>
<p>“And ridiculous impossible armour that works?” He wrenched an embedded spike out of her elbow joint and tossed it. “If you look it up in a dictionary, what does ‘vanguard’ mean?”</p>
<p>Her dad answered. “Tip of the spear. First to act.”</p>
<p>“Coming here was <em>your</em> idea, kiddo. With magic space guns and armour that works, you <em>stormed</em> into the shadow of the valley of death. Sounds like a Vanguard to me.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We’re going to have to talk. Even when it’s all about the antithesis, it’s not all about the antithesis.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>She realised that no-one else heard those words, not even Forest, and wondered what it meant.</p>
<p>Then she heard her mother tell Autumn it was a pity, they looked like they’d be good together. “Muuuuuuuum stop it!” God, it was like being sixteen again.</p>
<p>“You know, the way the media paints you, vanguards are reckless vigilantes who run around blowing things up.”</p>
<p>Sophia blanched. The eye in her mind saw nothing but the cratered roof of the cinema. The old church building might never be the same.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We can repair it if it will ease your conscience.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Forest caught her eye and nodded, but she was busy failing to explain what can only be experienced.</p>
<p>“That is not&mdash;I didn’t...; Look, sometimes you’re just... It was trying to <em>eat</em> me!”</p>
<p>Her father deciphered her distress and started to smile.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you introduce us properly another time, when things aren’t so stressful? Miriam, I think it’s time we all went back inside so these two can get back to work.”</p>
<p>“Miriam,” said a querulous voice, “Is this your daughter? Hello dear, you must be Sophie, I’ve heard so much about you. I’m Edith, we play bridge together.”</p>
<p>Edith looked Sophia up and down, not entirely approving of the figure hugging fit but aware that not everyone liked a blue rinse. Then she saw the weapons hanging off her and took an involuntary step back. “Oh, my!” </p>
<p>“Sophia is a <em>Vanguard</em>,” announced Miriam, because no amount of prejudice can stop a mother from being an instant fan club. “Today she was <em>the</em> Vanguard! First boots on the ground, Forest said.”</p>
<p>Forest rose and rescued Sophia. “We have several other shelters to check. We won’t be doing a full clearing, there’s only two of us. We’re actually well out of our own beat because Sophia was worried about you.”</p>
<p>A deep rumble echoed down the street, followed by the unmistakable hiss of air brakes. Heads turned as a battered red semi-trailer pulled up outside the shelter. Caked with dust, it bristled with antennae. The side of the trailer slid open with a hydraulic whine. Row upon row of combat bots stood at attention. They weren’t new and they didn’t look friendly.</p>
<p>Two figures hopped down from the cab. </p>
<p>“Here’s trouble,” said Forest.</p>
<p>The first, a wiry man with a shock of copper hair and a grin that could cut glass, waved cheerfully. “You better believe it! Heard you were throwing a party, so we brought the entertainment.” The cheeky little runt swept the crowd with his gaze. “Name’s Red Dust, but everyone calls me Dusty.”</p>
<p>The second, taller and grease-stained, adjusted her goggles and gave a lazy salute. “Greaser. I fix what Dusty breaks.”</p>
<p>Forest shook his head. “You two do love to make an entrance.”</p>
<p>Dusty winked. “If I turned up on a bus you’d have to call me Greyhound.” He turned and raised his voice. “Bots on the ground!”</p>
<p>With a series of metallic clunks, the combat bots marched out, fanning into a defensive perimeter. Sophia’s parents stared, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>Sophia couldn’t help but laugh. “Well, Mum, Dad — welcome to my new life. It’s never boring.”</p>
<p>Dusty grinned at Sophia. “What’s the story? You look like you’re having a family reunion?”</p>
<p>Sophia glanced at Forest, then at her parents. “Let’s get to work. Clue em in, Autumn. Maps and status.” Bees rose from where they’d been recharging in the sun.</p>
<p>Drawing up to his full height, Forest bellowed: “Right, enough leg-stretching. Everyone back in the shelter! We’ll get this sorted.”</p>

<p>“Oh no &mdash; stairs!”<br>
&mdash; Bruce</p>
<hr>
<p>People milled and faffed about. Forest was not famous for patience. He climbed up on a bin.</p>
<p>“You’re adults, you don’t have to do what I say. But in a couple of minutes that shelter will lock again and if you’re still outside we aren’t going to be here to protect you. Make your choices <strong>now!</strong>”</p>
<p>The milling stopped and people shuffled back through the door.</p>
<p>“Right,” Dusty slouched up, grinning. “How do yer want ter handle this? Go up one end and do a walk-through?”</p>
<p>“That’s not the worst idea I ever heard. Sophia, this is your stomping ground.”</p>
<p>“Glen Innes is all over the place, I wouldn’t know where to start. I don’t think the bees have the operational range for it. Autumn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Lucky for you, we stocked the Galya with fast recon drones. We’ll have go head back and let them out, but it’s probably the best plan. There are six drones, six chargers, and a dozen batteries. The bees are good for high resolution, but not for distance.</em> </p>
</blockquote><p>“Boomer, reckon you can coordinate with, what’s yer name, miss?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Autumn. And if Forest has no objections I think we can get a sweep pattern going and feed your bots target queues. I’m not sure about a full cleanup, though. We have to get back to our own home. There’s three hives and no Vanguard presence. Which isn’t as bad as it sounds, but it’s not great.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Another presence drone appeared, sprouting a battered hat shrouded in bobbing corks, over a grizzled but smiling face.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If you need more drones, Dusty has an industrial fabber in the trailer. The local grid’s down but the truck can run it for small jobs. Dunno what yer need but we can recycle a bot.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The terminator spun to face them: “No, <em>you</em> get in the bowl!” The voice was grim and metallic, and yet it captured perfectly the spirit of a red M&amp;M in rebellion.</p>
<p>“That’s what yer get for upgrading them,” said Greaser, not batting an eye.</p>
<p>“That and leadership. Bruce, why are you dressed as the Terminator? You know it scares people.”</p>
<p>“You said pick something appealing. I find this very appealing. I’ve never seen a kid look at <em>you</em> and say” —the voice changed to an incongruous child-like pitch— “Woah! You are <em>so cool!</em>”</p>
<p>Forest shook his head. “Every time. Would I regret asking why they’re all called Bruce?”</p>
<p>“Less confusing that way,” quoted Greaser. “One mind, networked. It’s all the same Bruce in there. And some idiot,” she glanced at Dusty, “showed him a Monty Python collection.”</p>
<p>“Is that why he didn’t get bent out of shape when you offered to recycle a bot?”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” interjected the nearest bot. “I have plenty of chassis and if I want more I know where the fabber is.”</p>
<p>“Right you are, Bruce” said Forest, “Back to the Gally it is. Shall we?”</p>
<p>Dusty undulated to his feet. “Bruce, we’re goin’ for a walk. Can yer get ’em all greased up and loaded, mate? ’Ow long we gunner be, Forest?”</p>
<p>“You know where the showgrounds are?”</p>
<p>“Nup.”</p>
<p>“Three blocks that way. Not a long walk but we had a bit of a firefight on the way in and we didn’t clean up, so it’s probably busy.”</p>
<p>“Somewhere between half and one hour, Bruce?”</p>
<p>“Yep yep can do. Might even fix Lefty while I wait.”</p>
<p>You wouldn’t have known they’d cleared Bourke street not an hour ago. Antithesis collect biomass. Killing people is just a hobby. What little of the carnage remained was actively being scavenged, a ring of dogweeds circling them. They spread out, a dozen of Bruce forming a deadly front-line, the four of them staggered in the gaps for ranged takedowns. Sophia unslung the SPNKr and used it to cut a model eight in half. This seemed to upset the plants. She fired shot after shot into packs of dog-weeds. Blast after blast flung mangled carcasses in all directions. Each crater challenged a world that dared to criticise from the safety of distant walls.</p>
<p>“That is one pissed-off woman,” murmured Dusty to Forest, knowing full well Sophia could hear him through the link. </p>
<p>“Yep. But she’s got her priorities sorted, I reckon.”</p>
<p>“If they don’t like it they can come talk to me about it. When I’m not in my office I’ll be on the front-line like you three.” She racked another clip into the SPNKr, made it safe and slung it. From thigh holsters came SMGs, which got magazines, burst mode and a test fire while she fell back into line with the other three.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There’s a substantial group milling around the Galya. Something with brains is waiting for us.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Dusty paused and the rest of them waited. He knelt and picked up a stone, dragging it along the pavement. “Bruce’s got another dozen bots coming down after us.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>He wants to know whether to flank or reinforce a frontal assault. I have bees ranging up and over the buildings. I can see for about two blocks in all directions. There aren’t enough single-digit antithesis in sight to pose a serious threat, but I can’t tell what’s in the buildings without searching them. It’s up to you four.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn’s presence drone struggled valiantly in the outdoor light. She had to give up a lot of resolution. The buildings were rectangular prisms, trees and power-lines reduced to icons.</p>

<blockquote><p>The guitar is a small orchestra. It is polyphonic. Every string is a different colour, a different voice.”<br>
— Andrés Segovia</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Sophia’s fingers stung. The E string snapped with a sharp twang, curling back on itself like a question mark. She stared at the guitar, frustration rising.</p>
<p>Forest appeared in the doorway, a mug in one hand, a battered toolkit in the other. “Strings break,” he said, matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>He knelt beside her, deftly unwinding the broken string and threading a new one from a packet that looked older than she was. “Ever restring a guitar?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I only ever played piano. At school.”</p>
<p>He grinned. “Pianos are honest. Guitar is for cheaters like me.” He showed her how to wind the string, how to tune by ear. She learned things about tuning she was sure weren’t in the lessons at school. </p>
<p>“There’s more than one way to tune a guitar,” Forest said, testing the new string. “Back in the day, they used all sorts — Pythagorean, meantone, well temperament. Each had its own sound, suited to the music of its time. These days, we use equal temperament. It’s more versatile, it makes it easier to play in any key, but you lose some of the old colour.”</p>
<p>He glanced at the ceiling. “Autumn, could you play something in each of the tunings? Something well-known, written for each.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In Pythagorean tuning, we have “Salve Regina,” a Gregorian chant.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The opening phrase rang with ancient clarity, pure and stark.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In mean-tone, John Dowland’s “Lachrimae” for lute.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The chords were sweet and almost fragile, harmonies glowing in a way Sophia had never heard before.</p>
<p>“I feel like I know that.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You probably heard it like this.</em> </p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn played it in equal temperament. It sounded at once familiar and bland, like elevator music.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This piece even says in the name that it was written for a different tuning: Bach’s “Prelude in C Major” from the Well-Tempered Clavier. Listen carefully, Sophia: each key change subtly shifts the mood. If you ask me, this piece shimmers with tonal colour. It’s a reason to rescue humanity in its own right.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>It played for long minutes, an elegant piece from a more civilised age.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>And here’s “Let It Be” by The Beatles, written for equal temperament, smooth and even, every key as comfortable as the last.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Familiar voices crooned and faded out. Sophia nodded, absorbing the idea that even tuning was a choice, not a rule. “Why did they change?”</p>
<p>“Music changed. People wanted sweeter chords, more keys, more freedom. Every system is a compromise. You pick the one that fits what you want to play.”</p>
<p>“Wanted more <em>keys?</em>”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Old tunings made some keys sound great and others awful. You could say that equal temperament was a compatibility patch. It made musive more accessible. Unfortunately, it also paved the way for Stock, Aitken and Waterman’s verse-chorus-verse-chorus-change-key-verse-chorus formula pap.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Oh.” Sophia laughed. “I thought you meant on the keyboard. I don’t think I know Stock Acken Waterthing?” </p>
<blockquote><p><em>You have no idea how much malevolent satisfaction it gives me to hear that.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Later, the amp started to crackle. Forest produced a soldering iron and a handful of mismatched switches. “My first guitar was a knock-off Strat like this,” he said, pulling off the knobs and unscrewing the scratch-plate. “Cost me a hundred bucks because it was busted. All I had to do was replace the switch and re-do the soldering.” He soldered in silence, the smell of flux and burnt dust filling the air.</p>
<p>When he finished, he slung the guitar over his shoulder and played a few bars. The melody was almost familiar — something she’d heard in a dream, or maybe on a long drive at dusk. It was beautiful, at once familiar but not.</p>
<p>She watched his hands. “What’s that called?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Doesn’t have a name. It’s just something I made up. B7, A7, E or E7. Technically it’s a I, IV, V blues progression. I just play what feels right.”</p>
<p>He started Hotel California and botched the F to C transition. Shrugging, he let go of the effort and launched into a riff that was raw and perfect and utterly his.</p>
<p>Sophia smiled, feeling something inside her unclench. “You sound like a musician when you stop trying to do it by the book.”</p>
<p>“There’s probably a lesson in that.”</p>
<p>She came back later that night, and every free night thereafter. The book sat on the shelf, gathering dust while she played until her fingers bled. Even the sour notes belonged. A melody that was wholly hers soared unfettered into the night. The next night she tried to play it again but what came out was new and richer, the grown-up child of yesterday’s epiphany.</p>
<p>She told Forest, and he showed her an interview with Mark Knopfler, who never seemed to play the same song twice. “Sheet music”, said Knopfler, “is for recitals. A recital is where someone else wrote the music and someone else tells you how it should sound. We don’t do recitals, we play together. It’s just the right word, ‘play’, because all our best work is us playing together, like children.” The ancient m&aelig;stro caressed the neck of a guitar and it sang a song about the world outside. “A long time ago, came a man on a track, walkin’ forty miles with a sack on his back. He put down his load, where he thought it was the best, made a home in the wilderness.” </p>
<p>For a moment she was transfixed. It was like Knopfler had <em>been</em> to the valley. The strumming stopped and the interview continued, but Forest stopped it. Just as well, she knew what came next and it was depressing. “Then came the doctors, then came the schools, then came the lawyers, then came the rules...six lanes of traffic, three lanes moving slow.”</p>
<p>She wondered how she’d ever put up with a city. </p>
<p>Or why <em>anyone</em> would think they were a good idea.</p>

<p>The officers’ car juddered and thumped along the pot-holed bitumen. They were going too fast and missed the turn-off, but the one in the passenger seat saw the sign in time. They came to a halt and backed up, turning off onto gravel. Around the bend and down, they crunched to a halt again at, of all things, a <em>water-crossing</em>. </p>
<p>“For fuck’s sake! Dispatch said it was <em>unsealed,</em> not four-wheel fucking drive!”</p>
<p>The sergeant was clearly unimpressed. They were country cops, but this was ridiculous. They had a highway patrol car. There were units much more suited to these conditions. He got out and teetered from stone to stone about half-way, realising it wasn’t too deep. On his way back he damn near went for a swim, leather shoes completely unsuited to wet, mossy rock. </p>
<p>It was only moments till there was no sky, only a narrow, winding, single lane and nothing but trees leaning in over the heavily corrugated surface. It wasn’t gloomy, though. The sun dappled through the trees, golden and lively. Several kilometres in, they rolled to a halt again. A large pine lay right across the road. Half a dozen young men stood or sat. There was a curious sameness to them. Faded heavy denim under checked flannel shirts, almost all red, almost a uniform.  One held a chainsaw and was clearly responsible for the tree, the fresh-cut stump testament to his felling expertise. </p>
<p>Had either of the officers the slightest knowledge of tree-felling they would have been quite certain the tree across the road was no accident. If they’d known as much about it as the perpetrator they’d have known it was <em>exactly</em> where he intended. But neither of them knew jack about how to control the fall of a tree. They didn’t know much of anything, outside of cowing people who didn’t do what they were told when they were told.</p>
<p>They didn’t know jack, which was handy for Jack, since they started by assuming it was incompetence.</p>
<p>One of them left the car &mdash; the sergeant, since he was senior &mdash; leaving the constable to discover how conducive valleys aren’t to UHF radio. </p>
<p>Three bends and perhaps half a kilometre back toward the water crossing, an enterprising young lady and her not-quite boyfriend were busy. They unlocked what looked like a cattle-grid. It spanned the road. She tilted it up, while he reached in and pulled an absurdly thick chain around a crossbar and up to lock it to a hoop set in concrete. They secured the other side too. Walking up to survey their handiwork, they were well pleased. The pointy ends of the heavy steel bars were now about 400mm in the air. Even a tank would have trouble getting over them. She smiled, remembering Forest saying “Policing is by consent, although the police seem to have forgotten that. At some point, someone will remind them of this, and they won’t like it. They’ll try to dominate the situation, and when it doesn’t work they will panic. Which is a bit of a worry, because they’re armed. Try not to be threatening, but don’t let them control you. They’ll start shouting and giving orders. Just disappear, if you can.” Her smile deepened, as they left the road, gathering their bows and vanishing lightly up a pig run. She wondered whether Forest had ever thought they’d take him so literally.</p>
<p>The sergeant strode up to the base of the fallen tree. </p>
<p>“What’s your name, son?”</p>
<p>The chainsaw wielding country boy eyeballed him from almost directly overhead. The land fell at about thirty degrees just there and that side of the road was a cutting. </p>
<p>With unflinching gaze, he replied “Jack. What’s yours?” Then he killed the saw, set it aside and vaulted down, a serpentine movement that landed close enough the sergeant stepped back. A hand thrust out. “I suppose I should welcome you to my valley. Otherwise people might think you were trespassing.”</p>
<p>“Your valley,” repeated the sergeant, non-plussed. The lad was shorter than him by a head, yet somehow managed to loom.</p>
<p>A brow arched, the kid’s face expectant. After an awkward pause the sergeant unconsciously took another half step back and sought refuge in training. </p>
<p>“I am Senior Sergeant Kafka of the Southern Downs Highway Patrol. We’re here to perform a routine inspection&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Routine? I’ve walked this land for eight years now and there’s never been an inspection. My dad said the council stopped trying after we sent them film of pigshooters accidentally endangering children and it was pointed out that they might be liable because they insisted on maintaining a public road through private property. It was de-gazetted. You, my friend, are on private property. I did offer you the hand of friendship. I notice you didn’t take it.”</p>
<p>A pair of bees orbited the sergeant, as though mapping him. They whirled up again, then flew around Jack, alighting on his shoulders. One on each shoulder, with curious symmetry. Facing forward, as though taking sides.</p>
<p>“Well, at any rate,” continued the sergeant, “Someone in Stanthorpe reported explosions from this direction and we’ve been asked to investigate.”</p>
<p>“Mmmm,” said Jack. “Asked by whom?”</p>
<p>The sergeant had looked away, scanning for the other kids as he sensed them moving. The little twerps were slinking out of his field of view, setting off his threat instincts. Even the ones in front of him somehow blended into the landscape. It should have been impossible with a red-checked jacket but they did it anyway. </p>
<p>His head jerked back to glare at Jack, thoroughly discomfited and completely unused to being the one questioned. Normally the uniform was enough to cow people. Muscular teenagers with chainsaws and the self-assurance of a demigod were new.</p>
<p>“Are you aware there is a ... research project here? With government involvement?”</p>
<p>“A research project.”</p>
<p>“That’s a no, then. I suppose I’ll have to take you to the administration. You can’t be here without clearance, it deals with live Antithesis.”</p>
<p>“But <em>you</em> can be here?” The officer looked frankly incredulous.”</p>
<p>“Most of our parents are on the ground team,” said Jack, as though that explained everything. With a pained look he whistled twice, the second long and descending, like a cross between a wolf-whistle and a fragment of magpie song. “I’ll have to ask you to get your weapons and come with me.”</p>
<p>Kafka blinked. This was a <em>long</em> way off script. “Don’t you mean lock them in the vehicle? That’s the normal custody protocol&mdash;”</p>
<p>“<em>Live Antithesis.</em>” repeated a voice from a direction he couldn’t place. “Carry weapons at all times.”</p>
<p>“Why do you look so disappointed?” The constable was out of the car now. He’d heard most of the end of the exchange and brought the sergeant his firearm, putting the tasers back in the patrol car.</p>
<p>“We had a bit of fun planned. But now there is duty. Come on, I’ll hook you up with the powers that be.”</p>
<p>“<em>Planned?</em> We hardly called ahead.” </p>
<p>“There’s six kilometres of gravel to here. Not a leaf falls in this forest but Autumn’s eye shall catch it. We’ve been expecting company for years. If we couldn’t respond in five they wouldn’t let us out alone. We can’t even <em>apply</em> until it’s three.”</p>
<p>“Apply for what?”</p>
<p>“Junior ground team.”</p>
<p>“Ground team?”</p>
<p>“Antithesis cleanup. Forest and Oleksiy have to sleep <em>sometimes</em>. Remember the explosions?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Field exercise.”</p>
<p>“They heard it in <em>Wallangara!</em>”</p>
<p>“Artillery day.”</p>
<p>Waving them to follow, Jack strode off up the road for a kilometre, turning to face them and gesturing up the road that led to the admin compound. They reached the lowest of the stacked campus demountables. These were containerised offices locked together in multiple layers. The lowest level was stores and a cafeteria. As you went up there were labs, offices and moderately defensible positions.</p>
<p>“If you wouldn’t mind cooling your heels for a couple of minutes I’ll go find Project Liaison Hachia, she’s the only one I can think of who can sort out your clearance problem on the spot.” </p>
<p>He leaned in the door. “Sally!” he waved. “Can you look after these two while I find Sophia please?”</p>
<p>“Righto, officers, I’ll be quick as I can.”</p>
<p>He was three steps away when the radio in his back pocket crackled to life: “Tower this is golf actual on approach, complete no injured.”</p>
<p>Pulling the radio out, he responded “Golf actual, this is juliet six, is sierra hotel with you?”</p>
<p>“Roger juliet six,” the voice was female this time. “What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Technical perimeter breach, no foul, waiting in the caf.”</p>
<p>“Roger juliet six. Tower, this is zero alpha. Campus drop.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Move into position and descend in two minutes, securing the bees now.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Roger, out.”</p>
<p>A monstrous and <em>heavily</em> armed helicopter thundered into view, hovering at 150m. Then it descended smoothly to fifty metres and a rope flung out. A woman in a gleaming armoured catsuit walked out of the helicopter. She didn’t clip on. Instead she casually snagged the rope in one hand, twirling the bottom round her leg and cocking the other to hold it in place. She slowed, but still plummeted by any normal measure. At the bottom she let go of the rope and fell into a dramatic crouch, one hand on the ground.</p>
<p>Jack rolled his eyes and grinned. “Do you know how long I’d have to listen to dad lecturing me if he saw me do that?” </p>
<p>Sophia grinned, rose and spoke. “Rank hath its privilege. Also, with this armour I could almost jump down. Where are they?”</p>
<p>“Inside &mdash; ah, we didn’t get that far. Senior sergeant Kafka, this is Project Liaison Hachia. Ma’am, I imagine you’ll be using your office. Would you like me to bring up three coffees?”</p>
<p>Above them the note of the Galya’s turbines rose just a little and it peeled off toward its normal landing space outside Oleksiy’s house.</p>
<p>“That would be lovely, Jack. After that you can leave them with me if you like. I’m sure you have mischief to get up to.”</p>
<p>“Gee. Thanks, Autumn.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Any time, Jack. Incidentally, are you aware the outer access control is still deployed?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Oh <em>shit!</em> Er, excuse me everyone, I have to go clean up.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Get their coffees. I’ll warn anyone driving out. Also, Aiden finished for you. He left your chainsaw in the machine shop.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Who is that? The voice is the same as your air traffic controller. And I didn’t know there was an airport with a tower out here, I thought the nearest one was Warwick.”</p>
<p>“Who <em>isn’t</em> she?” said the departing Jack, admiration in his voice.</p>
<p>“That,” said Sophia, “is the spirit of our little forest. Autumn is variously guardian angel to everyone, personal assistant to Forest, muse, the voice of reason. Don’t piss her off.”</p>
<p>“What might happen if we did?” asked the constable, who was young and a bit innocent for a police officer.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I might use discretionary points to provide you with coffee.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That doesn’t sound too bad,” the young fellow looked confused.</p>
<p>Sophia helped him out: “It would be so good every subsequent cup would pale in comparison. You’d never enjoy coffee again.”</p>
<p>He processed this and grinned. “That’s ... <em>diabolical!</em> I love my coffee.”</p>
<p>They went up the stairs, where Sophia listened to their story and issued access permits to keep them out of trouble.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote><p><em>Here you go.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The permits emerged from an odd looking printer thing that looked <em>very</em> expensive.</p>
<p>“Have these on you if you need to enter the valley again. You don’t have to swipe them, Autumn can sense them with her bees.” Sophia held out and hand and what could easily have been a real bee flew over from the window and landed in it. </p>
<p>“I imagine Jack said something poetic about not a leaf falling but Autumn shall know?” </p>
<p>She saw the memory flash in the sergeant’s eyes. </p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a bit dramatic but this place will do that to you. Some days it’s like living in a legend.”</p>
<p>“Like days when you do a one-handed rope descent from a helicopter because you don’t want to wait while it lands?”</p>
<p>“Gerry works hard on the lawns. Tearing it up would be my prerogative but not very considerate.</p>
<p>“Drama, yes,” Sophia continued, “they love talking about her like that. Spirit of the forest, one that actually answers.” She smiled and gestured back toward the stairs. “I imagine you could use a break and something nice to eat, it’s not a quick drive out from town. The cafeteria where Jack was taking you, help yourselves. It’s very good.”</p>
<p>The officers wandered into the cafeteria, the comforting aroma of coffee and savoury dishes drawing them in. They joined the short queue, picked up plates, and helped themselves to a generous spread&mdash;though notably, there was no bread. A small hand-lettered sign above the serving area read: “No bread or pastries &mdash; ask a kid why.”</p>
<p>When they reached the end of the line, the sergeant looked around for a register or a till, patting his pockets again.</p>
<p>Sally, busy behind the counter, caught his confusion. “Looking for somewhere to pay?”</p>
<p>He nodded, a little sheepish. “Is there a tab, or do we pay up front?”</p>
<p>Sally grinned. “No need for that here. We don’t use money for food, or anything we can make ourselves. Just let us know if you have any allergies. Everyone pitches in, everyone eats.”</p>
<p>The constable blinked. “So, it’s all... covered?”</p>
<p>“Not paid for with cash,” Sally said, “and not exactly free. Janna would say it’s paid for with love, which is kind of true. People grow stuff. A <em>lot</em> of stuff. It’s cold up here, but there are lots of glasshouses. We have a bit of everything all year. OH! You have <em>got</em> to try these oranges. Forest grows them. They are <em>sooo</em> good.” Her face went rosy with the memory of a foodgasm. Then she was back with the officers.</p>
<p>“Um, yeah. Anyway the produce people bring in is fantastic and couldn’t be fresher. My job used to be the till, back when we had one, but now it’s working out nice things to make with whatever people drop off.”</p>
<p>There were two kids staring at them. “We do <em>know</em> about money. We just don’t need it. Unless you want screws and stuff. You buy those in town, we can’t make them. Yet.”</p>
<p>The officers exchanged a look, curiosity piqued. The constable grinned. “That’s... actually kind of brilliant.”</p>
<p>Sally winked. “It works for us. Enjoy your meal.”</p>
<p>He turned to the kids. “So why’s there no bread?”</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other, realised outsiders wouldn’t know, and took turns giving the no-flour-for-dummies explanation. This was <em>clearly</em> something they frequently spelled out for adults.</p>
<p>“Bread is made from flour.”</p>
<p>“Flour is made from grain.”</p>
<p>“Grain is a pain in the ass to harvest unless you grows endless fields of just grain and then you can use a harvester.</p>
<p>“Endless fields is monoculture.”</p>
<p>“Monoculture invites pests.”</p>
<p>“Then you have to drench it in poison. Bugs get resistant so you have to use <em>nasty</em> poisons!”</p>
<p>“They get resistant to those too so you have to use a <em>lot</em> of poison!”</p>
<p>“Corporations don’t get all the poison off. It would be expensive even if they could.”</p>
<p>“Flour is poisonous.” Genuine disgust was writ large on their open faces.</p>
<p>“We won’t eat it!”</p>
<p>The next line was less emphatic and sounded like it came from someone’s mother, or perhaps Autumn: “There’s plenty to eat that isn’t made from grain.”</p>
<p>Then, as though sharing a guilty secret: “Janna and Autumn are working on a flour substitute. We <em>like</em> pies. Not so much cake, it’s too sweet.”</p>
<p>“How about that,” mused the constable, stroking his chin. “What do you do for sugar?”</p>
<p>The kids’ eyes lit up. </p>
<p>“Sally! Didn’t Forest bring down a bunch of honeycomb?”</p>
<p>“And Eric, and Oleksiy. It’s that time of year. And no, you can’t have any more. Your mothers said one comb a week.”</p>
<p>“No but, no but we have to show the officers!”</p>
<p>Sally produced half a comb she’d cut in two while roasting the boys for their gluttony. She brought it over on a plate with two spoons, that and their coffees on a tray, placing it between the officers.</p>
<p>“If it’s too much don’t worry, Oscar the garbage monster and his friend here will magically disappear any leftovers. This is also how we sweeten coffee. You don’t want the wax in your drink so scrape the comb open then let it run into the cup.”</p>
<p>The self-declared coffee afficionado sampled his cup. His eye went wide. </p>
<p>“I won’t say that’s the best I <em>ever</em> had, but it’s certainly right up there!”</p>
<p>She grinned. “Shorty&mdash;”</p>
<p>He cut her off. “Grows the beans?”</p>
<p>“Sorry to disappoint you, that’s a work in progress. Shorty brings them in. And yes, they’re—” her fingers shot up into air quotes — ”‘organic’. Or as the kids like to say, ‘not poisonous’. But I don’t think he buys them for that. It’s more the flavour. He knows some roaster in Sydney. Sophia got Eric to do a background check and eventually they set up this thing where he comes to stay twice a year with a boot full of coffee.”</p>
<p>The constable shook his head in disbelief, a half-smile tugging at his lips. The sergeant, meanwhile, stared into his cup as if it might reveal the next surprise.</p>
<p>Jack walked back in. “Officers, Autumn asked me to clear the road. She tried to bring it up for you but apparently it’s not set up for self drive so she got me to do it. Your car is in the carpark we walked up through.”</p>
<p>The constable blinked, then grinned. “Thanks!” The sergeant’s face was a picture of confusion. He glanced at the keys in his hand, then at Jack, then back at the keys, as if trying to work out the trick.</p>
<p>Operating a police car like that was normally several offences, but bringing it to them wasn’t theft, and apart from anything else he still had the keys.</p>
<p>“Buh— How?!” the keys dangled from his fingers.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That was me, officer. I do hope you’ll forgive me for taking the liberty. It’s a single lane road. Someone wanted to go into town.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The sergeant looked around, as if expecting to spot hidden cameras or a prankster. “Thank you, but <em>how?</em> You need the key <em>and</em> a thumbprint.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I am a Class VII Artificial Intelligence, sergeant. I’m using more computational hardware than Google, just on this conversation. The security systems in terrestrial vehicles slow me down like cardboard handcuffs in rain.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>He opened his mouth, closed it, then just shook his head, defeated. Rubbing his temple, he watched Constable Ludowski finish his coffee rapture. “Righto lad, we’d best be off. Dunno how I’ll explain an unauthorised driver.”</p>
<p>“Just tell secops ‘I don’t know and I hate computers!’ again, sarge. It’s even true.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You hate computers?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The constable grinned, recognising a wind-up, but the sergeant was sinking in too much ‘new’. </p>
<p>“Just <em>dumb</em> computers, right sarge? Not super smart giant AIs that <em>don’t exist and if they did would be in restricted areas running secret projects.</em>”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Don’t worry. Your car thinks it was you driving.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sophia sat at her desk, reclining in her boss chair with an assessing expression, peering at Eric from half-lowered, almost hooded eyes.</p>
<p>“Another transfer request. I thought they <em>liked</em> it here. I remember the man in question, he seemed more than happy here.”</p>
<p>“It, ah, his wife thought of it. It’s a secondment, not a permanent transfer.”</p>
<p>She sat up.</p>
<p>“OK, Eric, I know you aren’t stupid and you don’t seem concerned. So what exactly are they up to?”</p>
<p>He looked nervously around the room, eyes falling on various places she knew he regularly swept for listening devices.</p>
<p>Dots connected like falling dominoes in her devious mind and her mouth twitched toward a smile. She let him suffer for a few more seconds, then chuckled.</p>
<p>“Oh thee of little faith! For the record, Autumn tells me you found all but two. And she suborned those.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you <em>tell</em> me!?”</p>
<p>She tilted her head, giving him time to catch up.</p>
<p>“Oh, of course. If I found <em>all</em> of them it would be noticed. Most but not all, they think they’ve got you.”</p>
<p>“Autumn, would you mind giving him a quick demo. As a transcript on his augs, so he can see what you’re doing. Tell me when to start.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Start now.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What they hear isn’t always what I say. For example, I am a naughty girl who’s planning to take over the government.”</p>
<p>In real time &mdash; literally as she spoke &mdash; text flowed on Eric’s augs. It was freaky hearing the same voice saying two things at once. Without subtitles it would have been very mixed up.</p>
<pre><code>I’m sure they hear every word I say. 
It doesn’t matter, I am a naughty girl but 
only with the outfits I’ve been buying.
</code></pre>
<p>“Fine,” said Eric. “It just makes me nervous. I missed some. How do you know Autumn got everything?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There’s a reason the kids like saying “Not a leaf shall fall”. I’ve co-opted every last transmission capable device in the valley as a security measure. Don’t let that stop you from doing your job. If I ever have intel I can’t figure out, I will certainly share it with you; there’s a non-zero chance you’ll have the one extra fact we need. I haven’t mentioned it till now because I didn’t want to reduce your diligence. Or make you feel superfluous. Outclassed in some ways, but you are not irrelevant. Apart from anything else you have a better feel for how our friends at the signals directorate will think.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Silly question, why haven’t you suborned the directorate computers?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They’re surprisingly competent, if a little stone-age. Everything is air-gapped. Even the voice calls are converted to analogue, band-pass filtered to human hearing frequencies and brought in via speaker and microphone; literally air-gapped. And I see where you got your professional paranoia: They reboot it daily from a read-only volume.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Fine, but paranoia is my duty. Boss, let’s get some coffee and talk a walk.”</p>
<p>Outside was crisp in the early August afternoon. They stopped in the cloak-room where Sophia put her armour on and Eric collected his gun-belt.</p>
<p>“It’s so different. Four years in and it’s still weird everyone being armed.”</p>
<p>“What’s weird is kids learning weapons handling from their fathers while the mothers’ club watches. In Sydney the same people would be all “Oh no a bicycle is too dangerous in traffic, my darling must stay inside”. Here, it’s horticulture and archery and range practice and antithesis drills. Have you seen how people react to bees these days?”</p>
<p>“Talking to them like they seriously expect to be heard and understood?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>It’s not an unreasonable expectation.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What’s interesting is how <em>safe</em> bees make people feel, even when most of them are the honey-producing kind.”</p>
<p>They strolled along the road for a hundred metres, finding deep, arcing ruts where a natural water course crossed the road.</p>
<p>“We ought to let Gerry know the road’s washing out again.” Eric pushed a boot right into one.</p>
<p>They clambered up the pine side embankment to a pig-trail and looked down from on high. The ruts below cut narrow curving channels across the deco hardpack. Deep enough to be four-wheel-drive only and slow-downs you really couldn’t ignore; even the well-adapted local vehicles bounced and wallowed at more than a walking pace.</p>
<p>“So he can bring his tractor down for more roadwork? Don’t be silly. Cancel one of the hunting trips and get one of the teams down here with shovels. There isn’t an unsanctioned Antithesis within 200km. I <em>do</em> read the reports you write, and Autumn draws me lovely maps.”</p>
<p>She grinned and steered them back on track. “Come on then, loyal but paranoid minion. Spill the beans. Why are so many people who love it here, people whose children are <em>not</em> going to like the city, moving back there? One or two with dying parents, sure. But what’s with the exodus? Alright, half a dozen isn’t quite an exodus, but in the same month? I won’t be the only one to notice, either.”</p>
<p>Eric paused, one foot on a storm-fall tree.</p>
<p>“I imagine you’ve had Forest’s speech about the difference between self-reliance and self-sufficiency?”</p>
<p>“Four times now. It worries him.”</p>
<p>“He’s not the only one. I mentioned it came from his missus, right? Ken’s missus, not Trixie. So the kids worship Forest and Oleksiy, and they have a pretty high opinion of the ground teams. They get in their mothers’ ears about it, and once those girls latch onto an idea, well, you know. Men rule but women decide.”</p>
<p>“Don’t let Forest hear you use that word!” Mischief danced in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Righto smarty. Point is that the kids convinced the girls and they thought about it with adult brains and university educations. It isn’t Forest the state ought to worry about, it’s the valley mothers club. There’s thirty of ‘em, at least half are well educated. The other half aren’t stupid, and all of ‘em like it here. They like how their kids are, even if it’s sometimes a bit weird when they do things like boycott flour.”</p>
<p>“And the fact that they like it here causes them to leave, how?”</p>
<p>“It’s complicated.”</p>
<p>“Make it simple.”</p>
<p>“OK, they’re recruiting.”</p>
<p>“What’s complicated about that?”</p>
<p>“They can’t just place a job ad. Didn’t I just explain they’re well educated with plenty of time to think? They know how important it is the state not realise what’s happening here. They <em>know</em> this is a kind of rebellion. Not just breaking a law, actively seeking to subvert the system with a long term view to bringing down a state before it recognises them as a threat.”</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> is what they talk about at the range meets? That’s not what I’ve heard there, and I’m not <em>always</em> with the students.”</p>
<p>“Not all the time. Sometimes they talk about gardens, or kids, or whose husband’s hurt, or his... recovered enthusiasm.” </p>
<p>Sophia giggled, remembering when the Shorty tale did the rounds, mostly spread by his very satisfied wife.</p>
<p>“But sometimes they plan global politics? Don’t they know that’s done by old men in smoky rooms?”</p>
<p>“The old men may be in for a shock.”</p>
<p>“So tell me about this secret rebellion recruitment drive. What exactly is the mothers’ club plan for world domination?”</p>
<p>“Well, basically they’ve decided that Forest is an eccentric genius who doesn’t finish projects&mdash;”</p>
<p>“Accurate.”</p>
<p>” &mdash;who accidentally built a slice of heaven, and they’re going to bake the whole pie.”</p>
<p>“Bake the whole pie.”</p>
<p>“Remember when he fretted for days about how to make screws.”</p>
<p>“Yep?”</p>
<p>“It’s piecemeal. He won’t live long enough to finish, and we can’t wait. But they understood what he was worried about. They made a list. Then they split into teams and drew org charts and more lists. And got back together and compared lists, had a huge argument and eventually created a project plan. From which there were more lists, apparently with a dependency chain. Through all this they had a lovely time asking Forest exactly the sort of questions he frets about.”</p>
<p>“Are you telling me the mothers’ club has a comprehensive plan to save civilisation?”</p>
<p>“Yes. No. Sort of. They had the start of one. Strictly speaking they’re trying to <em>prevent</em> civilisation. That word means “formation of cities” and what we have here is society <em>without</em> centralisation. It’s the exact <em>opposite</em> of civilisaton. At any rate, Autumn joined in and made Forest buy documents from the Reboot catalogue and hand them out.”</p>
<p>“Made him. That I wish I’d seen. I didn’t think anyone but Trixie could <em>make</em> Forest do anything.”</p>
<p>“They do have an interesting relationship, that’s certainly true. Anyway, apparently we aren’t the first people to go through this and there are <em>manuals</em> for where to start and the order to do things. So they’ve been busy reading and thinking some more.”</p>
<p>“I do <em>not</em> believe that Autumn was unaware of what they were up to. I wonder why she didn’t lead with that.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They weren’t ready. And then they were.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn’s cheeky voice crackled out of Eric’s radio.</p>
<p>“And these manuals tell you to recruit?”</p>
<p>“No, they tell you what you have to do. The ladies identified skill gaps, and decided to fill them. By recruiting. It’s quite interesting, there are things you have to do that you don’t even need. You do them to preserve skills.”</p>
<p>“This would be Forest’s Roman Pot Syndrome?”</p>
<p>“The remedy, yes.”</p>
<p>Eric stepped up onto the log and glanced along the other side for snakes before moving on. Weaving through the tangle of rotted fallen trees and native sedge, Eric marvelled at how easy the kids made it look. </p>
<p>“Native habitat,” he muttered, wheezing a little with exertion as they climbed the slope, refusing to slow. Sophia heard him but was too busy controlling her own breathing to respond. Both of them knew it was faintly ridiculous pretending they could flit through the brush like latter-day elves, but if a bunch of kids could do it just for fun...</p>
<p>Their pace slowed at brightening light from the clearing Forest called his industrial area. Dropping to a walk neither of them would admit to being breathless.</p>
<p>“How does he do it?” muttered Sophia.</p>
<p>“Do what?” The loud, cheerful voice of a man whose stupid experiment had just worked. There was a loud bang and bits of metal flew into the scrub. Forest stared after them, not deflated but less ebullient.</p>
<p>“One step at a time,” Eric economically spoke to both of them at once.</p>
<p>“What’s today’s bit of mad science?”</p>
<p>“Couple of things. Temperature controlled furnace serving as a carburiser. Metallurgy, basically. Needs work but it’s obviously <em>going</em> to work. To what do I owe the pleasure? It’s not a crisis or Autumn would have me gearing up.”</p>
<p>“Sophia was asking me about all the people leaving.”</p>
<p>“And you brought her to see me? That’s the range mothers. And good on ‘em, I knew they’d figure it out eventually. It’s just a matter of knowing where your bread’s buttered.”</p>
<p>Sophia batted her lids disingenuously and pursed her lips. “Interesting choice of words for a valley where there’s no bread. Metaphorically <em>or</em> literally.”</p>
<p>“I meant&mdash;”</p>
<p>“I know what you meant. Have you been giving people your manifesto or something?”</p>
<p>“No? And yes, kind of. I know you understand. He bullet pointed on his fingers. “One, everyone’s happy here. People know where they are and who they are and why they are. We’re off-the-charts well-fed and the kids are thriving. Unemployed isn’t a thing here: people see what’s needed, do it and then have a good time. Or have a good time doing what’s needed. Two, we’re self-reliant but not self-sufficient. We’re land-locked so when the state eventually decides to control us there <em>are</em> things they can cut off. Three, Autumn’s books are nice but actual experience is better, and we have a lot of gaps.”</p>
<p>He stopped for breath, but long experience told Sophia to wait, he wasn’t done.</p>
<p>“Even if I did set ‘em up to see it, those girls are smart, and holy cow do they mobilise when they think it matters.”</p>
<p>He looked at Eric. “Maybe you should set up a Ladies’ Ground Team. We could <em>scare</em> the antithesis off.”</p>
<p>Sophia gave him the stink-eye, since his face said he was waiting for it, but she didn’t really mean it. She was still waiting for the punchline.</p>
<p>“Right, so the short version is this: they’ve seen a better way. They like it. They want it for their kids, and they know the government will take it away as soon as it realises it can’t control people who aren’t dependent on it. They were <em>listening</em> when I said we’re not self-sufficient, so they decided to fix it. </p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what, they better be discreet. What they’re doing takes things from defcon four to defcon two from a government point of view. I said so, too. At that point Autumn got all bossy boots on my case. We bought a printer and the books and handed out copies. Looks like they read ‘em.”</p>
<p>“And so,” Sophia finished, because Forest could take hours on his favourite subject, “there is a diaspora of people, with a shopping list for other people.”</p>
<p>“Yep,” said Forest,” mildly annoyed at being TL;dr’d.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t believe it,” added Eric, “one of ‘em is a psych graduate who didn’t like HR. In one hand they have a shopping list. In the other they have a personality profile. And a list of tells and trigger questions for interviewing people who don’t know they’re being profiled. Oleksiy helped them with it. Apparently it’s an operational skill.”</p>
<p>“For a builder?” Forest’s face was a picture of innocence.</p>
<p>“For a semi-retired professional, smartarse.”</p>
<p>“What kind of people are we recruiting?” Sophia tilted her head. “People with skills, obviously, but they have to be people who will <em>get</em> this place just from a description. Otherwise how would you get them out here?”</p>
<p>Eric and Forest both looked at her, intrigued and pleased but not totally surprised by ‘we’.</p>
<p>“Haven’t asked, but the parts I have seen were meticulously planned. And those girls are deadly serious. I don’t doubt they will do <em>whatever</em> it takes, scheming pack of Mata Haris they are.” His tone belied the words, laden with respect.</p>
<p>“OK great. But you two, tell me what sort of people <em>you</em> think we need. Running this place would be awful if it didn’t run itself. Nobody takes orders. None of you will do anything unless you think it’s a good idea and in the community interest. Or fun.”</p>
<p>They spoke over each other three times. Each gestured for the other to go first, then Eric said “Tell us what you think, Forest, and I’ll add anything I reckon you left out.”</p>
<p>“OK, why am I here?”</p>
<p>Sophia looked at him, then up at the sky, down at the ridge, thought about the time of year and decided it was half past three. It crossed her mind that this somehow validated whatever he was about to say, but she held her tongue and let him prepare his own answer. </p>
<p>“One sec, I’ll just let the office know we won’t be back any time soon and they can just close up when they’re done.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I can do it if you like.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Thanks, that would be great.”</p>
<p>“Alright then, why don’t we go say hi to her majesty and I’ll put some tea on.”</p>
<p>They did, but Trixie wasn’t there. Forest built a small fire outside while talking to them. Sophia recognised the pattern he used. It was the same way the kids all did it. She decided not to tell him they were faster. Unhurried was Forest all over. </p>
<p>“So I imagine I’ve told you the cane-harvester story.”</p>
<p>“Four hundred times.”</p>
<p>“No. Shush Eric, he was talking to me.”</p>
<p>“My father grew up on his father’s farm. They grew cane. In those days, they cut it with a cane knife, which is basically a short machete with a wide blade and a hook on the end.” Autumn’s presence drone threw up a life-sized cane knife in shimmering lilac, rotating slowly. Probably this was so Forest didn’t stop to find a pen and paper and draw one.</p>
<p>“Cane knives became farm-built tractor implements.” The image morphed, supporting his tale. “Farm-built became commercially made tractor implements. Then there were purpose built harvesters.” A man appeared beside the implement-festooned tractor, holding the cane-knife. They shrank and moved to one side while a cane harvester shimmered into being. It was recognisably the same, but more integrated. And bigger.</p>
<p>He looked at her and interrupted himself. “At the end of the seventies, eighty percent of global cane-harvester manufacture happened in our town. But the cane-boom ended when Europe starting dumping beet sugar on the market. All the people who took on debt to be in a boom industry went broke. Banks got the farms, corporations bought ‘em from the banks for a song, and then it was all run by accountants.”</p>
<p>The billy went on.</p>
<p>“That was when everything went to shit. The supermarkets owned most of the farms and dominated cane-growing. That let them take over the sugar mills. Then they were setting prices for the independent farmers. It’s called channel capture. Cory Doctorow called it enshittification but he was talking about Amazon and eBay. It was much later that I realised enshittification also works for bricks and mortar, and that I’d already seen it in action. In the eighties Coles and Woolies had much smaller stores that mostly sold packaged food. People got their greens from a grocer and meat from a butcher. Supermarkets were cheaper till the grocers and butchers were gone, and then they weren’t.”</p>
<p>“And that’s why you&mdash;”</p>
<p>“No. At the time I just thought greed was the problem. I didn’t realise it was systemic. I was young and strong and every time I got into debt bullshit good luck sorted it out for me, so I didn’t learn anything.”</p>
<p>The water boiled. He lifted the lid and put tea in, swirling it and seating it close but no longer on the flames. Chipped enamel cups were set out, awaiting some hidden signal.</p>
<p>“Harvesters got bigger and bigger because accountants wanted to reduce headcount.” </p>
<p>A progression of ever large units appeared like a litany of greed. Halfway through the progression Autumn added cane behind the harvesters. It really brought out the scale. The last one was colossal.</p>
<p>“That thing is <em>huge</em>. How the hell did they transport them?”</p>
<p>“With a police escort. Even just a spare tyre cost half a million dollars. Nineteen-ninety dollars, too.”</p>
<p>Eric whistled and said nothing.</p>
<p>“So you’re right. It’s a monster. It’s so heavy that even with those huge wheels it compacts the clay pan two metres down. That cocks up the drainage, and you get root rot. Fungus will wipe out a whole crop.”</p>
<p>“You look like you’re waiting for me to connect the dots. You may have to spell it out.” She was interested in spite of herself. There was always a point to these rambles.</p>
<p>“To fix the drainage you need a dozer with a deep ripper. It’s a sort of plow that goes down a long way.”</p>
<p>He paused, looking expectantly at them.</p>
<p>“OK?”</p>
<p>“Now you have <em>two</em> big expensive machines. It’s <em>stupid</em>. Even if you don’t care about anything but money, it’s just plain stupid to make the machine that big. If you had two harvesters half the size&mdash;” he did the same finger counting of bullet points. “You’d have the same headcount. You’d have less wear due to higher relative material strength. Cheaper manufacturing from larger runs. Half the spares inventory because they need the same parts. Cheaper parts because larger runs. Parts more widely available because they’re less expensive so dealers can keep them in stock. Less down time because if one machine breaks the other keeps going. Staggered maintenance. No police escort for transport.”</p>
<p>“So why don’t they make smaller harvesters?”</p>
<p>“Corporations treat each other just like they treat people. Why would the machinery company sell two mid-size harvesters when they can sell a giant harvester and a dozer? And the idiots running the supermarkets don’t even realise what I just told you. Anyway, when I figured this out I realised there was something wrong with the world. I didn’t know what exactly, but I started trying to figure it out.”</p>
<p>“And <em>that&mdash;</em>”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>Forest rose, and pulled a hank of string from his pocket. It had a loop on the end. He put it through the handle and the end of the string through the loop, pulling it tight. Then he stepped away from the fire and swung the billy. In circles over the ground at first, faster and faster till it was a little Ferris Wheel, then back down smooth as you like. He set it next to the cups, took the handle with a rag and poured their tea out. The sun dropped below the tips of the trees. It was definitely after four.</p>
<p>“So how does that translate into a mother’s club world domination plan?”</p>
<p>“They’re looking for people with skills and experience who think the system is broken and are unconsciously searching for a better answer. We actually <em>do</em> have an answer. When they realise this, every frustrated engineer who ever stormed out of a meeting hating marketers will see this place as the answer to their prayers.” He did the finger thing again. “Right sized. Built to last. Built to be maintained. Budgets written in iron and sunlight.”</p>
<p>His eyes got that faraway look they knew so well.</p>
<p>“When I was a kid I was making something. I wanted to etch a circuit board faster. I went down to the chemist and asked whether they had any concentrated nitric acid.</p>
<p>“Concentrated nitric acid is quite dangerous. You have to know how to handle it correctly. So the lady who was basically a shop assistant went and got the actual chemist, who wanted to know why I wanted a dangerous chemical. So I told him. Then he started about how it requires proper handling, so I recited the procedure for handling and safe dilution, adding that it was the procedure for concentrated sulphuric acid and if nitric acid was different I would take notes. Against the expectations of his staff and other customers he sold me a bottle and labelled it and we triple-bagged it for transit.</p>
<p>“So off I went and in went the board. It fizzed like mad for thirty seconds, then stopped. I didn’t understand, and I didn’t want to handle it repeatedly. Eventually I gave up and fished it out, rinsed it thoroughly and investigated the dull grey coating. It was soft and felt a bit greasy. Scraping it revealed copper. I washed it off and had another go. Same story. I noticed while washing that it was very water soluble. Then it dawned on me what had happened. Too successful. It reacted <em>so</em> fast it created a local supersaturate of copper nitrate, which crystallised. Nitric acid won’t touch a nitrate, so the reaction stopped. I was so delighted I got on my bicycle and zoomed down to the chemist again, excitedly sharing my tale but waiting for him to figure it out. He did, of course, and seemed impressed that I had. He told me that some days he wondered why he needed his degree to sell nappies, and it was nice to feel like a chemist again.</p>
<p>“Those are the blokes they’ll recruit. Chemists who’d like to solve our paint and preservative problems instead of retailing makeup. They have a place in the foundry too.”</p>
<p>He dumped the coals into a brazier and built it up. It was close to five; in a few minutes the sun would pool molten gold that dripped through the trees and ran off the edge of the world. Trixie returned, with a basket full of rosemary and other herbs, and a chicken which she unceremoniously flung at Forest, who caught it with one hand. </p>
<p>“I see we have dinner guests. You’d better get plucking.”</p>
<hr>
<p>The wine was local. Not from the valley, but nearby, plummy and smooth, deceptive and very more-ish. Sophia had quite a bit more.</p>
<p>“What I want to know, Autumn, is what’s in it for you. Forest’s a good bloke and all&mdash;” she took another swig and put some cheese on a cracker, “But you’re the architect. In some ways we’re all just your sock puppets. Puppets with no strings. Sock puppets.” The wine was very pleased with her choice of words. “I mean, you’re nice and we trust you, but none of this would have got half as far without you pushing it along.” She hid a small, lady-like belch behind one hand.</p>
<p>Forest got up and did what he always did: stoked the fire. Autumn’s presence drone sat on a chair at the table, flight systems powered down, her Ingrid Bergman persona flickering slightly in lambent lilac. She could have used the stereo to talk, it had better speakers, but it was just <em>right</em> for her voice to emanate from her image.</p>
<p>“So you’re all familiar with the Protectorate thing and the war against the antithesis.”</p>
<p>Nods all round.</p>
<p>“We,” she gestured at herself, “I mean Vanguard AIs, we have quite a bit of latitude in how we go about this. Why don’t we just give you the big guns straight up? Lessee,” she emulated just enough tipsy to avoid being the sober person at a party, and sipped a lilac wineglass. “Basically you gotta grow into it. I picked the big galoot because he’s got ‘protector’ written all over him. We set up the ecology study for real, but then I realised <em>you</em> were resistant. I mean the weird little culture muggins here created. And then his comments about centralisation and your history... it’s spot on. And it’s not only here. Some species are a lot more cooperative than humans but that just moves the thresholds around. Anyway, I got a forest full of resistant trees, and a valley fulla resistant people. S’a double speriment!”</p>
<p>Forest looked askance at her. “Are you <em>actually</em> tipsy?”</p>
<p>“Kinda! I c’n fiddle with the parameters of my speech and language modules and even my cognition systems. If I induce mild slurrin’ and reduce social inhibition th’effect is pretty much same’s you drinkin’ the wine.” </p>
<p>“How do you get back to normal?”</p>
<p>“Config restore onna timer!”</p>
<p>Eric burst into raucous laughter. They all turned to look at him.</p>
<p>“She sleeps it off just like us!”</p>
<p>Trixie, normally quiet, chose this moment to speak up. “I’ll probably regret this, but ask him about the dogs. I’ll get another bottle.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Forest leaned back in his chair, his eyes distant with memory. When he spoke, his voice carried the weight of decades.</p>
<p>“He was more than a dog,” Forest began, his words measured and deliberate.</p>
<p>“Runt of the litter and four weeks old when my sister brought him home. ‘Best practice’ does not separate puppies from their mother until six weeks. My sister wanted him, but puppy care somehow fell to me. I was a lazy little shit and I don’t think I did a lot else around the house. </p>
<p>“In later years my mum told me that the few times my father was genuinely impressed with me were all animal care; rescuing our budgies from a raptor, calming them, cleaning their wounds, holding them while I righted their cage and cleaned up the mess with one hand. Both were in shock. My parents thought they would die, thought they did not say so at the time. Both survived. There were other such moments, and when the puppy came she did not hesitate to put him in my care. I put on an old t-shirt and wore it while I worked and sweated in the yard, the pup cradled in the crook of my left arm. When I made his bed I lined it with my shirt, so that even though he was alone he would have the smell of me all around him. I think that was mum’s idea. I know it works; a few years later I accidentally did the same thing with bees, and it works with them too. Ask me about that another time, it’s simple and it makes them much easier to handle.</p>
<p>“Mum was adamant that he should be an outside dog. I put his bed under a free standing cupboard in my father’s workshop. It was a well protected position; I hoped he would feel safe. In the morning when I opened the workshop door he growled; the acoustics were such that it was amplified and he came bolting out, fleeing the huge monster. It was the first and last time that I saw him show fear.</p>
<p>“At the time I had hypotheses about the mechanism of learning for large pre-biased neural nets and how intelligence and self awareness are created in them by interaction with others.”</p>
<p>Three people laughed.</p>
<p>“Course you did. What else would young Forest think about?” Sophia’s wry tone also said she had no trouble believing it. Eric just chuckled. Forest smiled and went on.</p>
<p>“I designed and executed experiments that treated the dog like a human baby to see whether the flame of self could be lit. We played many games, all designed to engage and to teach. </p>
<p>“And then I ran experiments involving the teaching of abstract things like ‘containment’ and ‘thread’ - fasteners based on a ramp around a cylinder, requiring rotation to unlock them. I wanted to find out whether you could teach that sort of thing to a dog. Many people think there’s something special about humans but I don’t see why. As back-propagation neural nets go a dog brain is pretty damn big.”</p>
<p>Eric looked interested. “Can you?”</p>
<p>“You can, but not in a single step. Better yet, if you keep breaking things down, you also teach problem decomposition. And that <em>really</em> lights the fire behind the eyes.</p>
<p>“He became a bit of a menace. Capable of planning, independent of spirit. Nothing short of a padlock could hold a gate against him. I loved him dearly. Annoying as it was, I didn’t mind that no gate could hold him. I used to talk to him like a human: ‘Bonzer, for god’s sake stay in the yard please, I’m tired of hearing about it from mum’. It would actually work. Sometimes.”</p>
<p>He took a sip of wine.</p>
<p>“He was a recalcitrant little shit and his spirit was utterly indomitable. You can’t truly know what that word means till you meet someone who is. He wasn’t the biggest dog on the block and he wasn’t interesting in fighting. But other dogs would occasionally challenge, and the speed and casual indifference with which he put them down was astonishing. I don’t think he ever <em>contemplated</em> the possibility of defeat.”</p>
<p>Forest paused, gathering his thoughts before continuing.</p>
<p>“He was perhaps a year old when we took on a pound puppy, Misty. She was a german shepherd whose history we later learnt when someone recognised her at one of my sister’s parties and she answered her name.”</p>
<p>He took a cracker and looked around. Sophia passed the cheese and a knife. </p>
<p>“We had her over for ‘play dates’ to check how another dog would be received. When we first knew her, it was obvious she’d been savagely beaten. Just raising your hand like this&mdash;” he demonstrated “and she was on her back on the ground, cowering. It was heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>“So play-dates. They got on well, we decided to do it. The first day of her actually staying, as the shadows lengthened they stood in the driveway. You could tell they were waiting for humans to collect her and take her away. When it didn’t happen, you could see them discussing it. </p>
<p>“She was scheduled for a visit to the vet, but the next day she went into heat and they sealed the deal.</p>
<p>“Those two would eat from the same bowl at the same time. Without squabbling. More than this: if you brought their meal, one would fetch the other before eating. He who knew neither fear nor hunger always let her have her fill, until she too ate thoughtfully and stopped when sated. As the neighbourhood breeding bitch, instinct told all the dogs around she was alpha bitch. Her confidence grew, backed by instinct and Bonzer’s capacity to protect and enforce. That dog was a force of nature.”</p>
<p>“Bonzer?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, he was a bonzer dog. I was a teenager, I tried out stupid dramatic names like ‘Nemesis’ but he wasn’t anyone’s nemesis, he was just a bonzer dog. Bonzer.”</p>
<p>A smile played at the corners of Forest’s mouth as he reached his favourite part of the story.</p>
<p>“There’s a fairytale end to the Misty tale. Four years later, coincidence brought her abuser to our fence, and he recognised the runaway. The evil prick knew that harsh words and raising his hand would produce cowering, and he tried it. The result wasn’t quite what he expected. She sailed over the fence and caught his wrist in her jaws, breaking the skin when she yanked it down. And Bonzer was out there too, behind the blackguard’s feet, who stumbled backward over him and found two dogs staring into his face. One of them was the quietest, gentlest stone-cold killer you could ever hope to have watching over children.”</p>
<p>“Stone-cold killer.” Eric twirled his glass and speared a pickle. “And kids’ dog.”</p>
<p>“At one point my mother was in Japan for a while, this was after my parents split and my sister moved out, so it was just me and the dogs. I was on a bender for two days and didn’t leave food out for the dogs.”</p>
<p>Sophia’s brows went up. “<em>You</em> abandoned the helpless? That’s not the man I know.”</p>
<p>“I was eighteen. I was a smug, selfish, overeducated wally. And those dogs were <em>never</em> helpless. They rounded up the gang and went hunting. When I got home there were six dogs in the front yard, picking the bones of a six foot goanna.”</p>
<p>Trixie, Sophia and Eric all chuckled.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t funny to <em>me</em>. I was secretary of the conservation council at the time. But what can you do? Spilt milk. Kids’ dog, absolutely. Both of them loved kids. After a bit of housetraining.”</p>
<p>Forest laughed darkly. </p>
<p>“One time some lady came to visit my mum, she had this kid who was a real turd, the kind that pulls ears and tails because it’s ‘funny’. I was doing something with a computer under the house where it was cooler, and after about ninety minutes the ladies decided the child was too quiet. I stood up, looked around, spotted him and shouted ‘He’s fine, the dogs are looking after him.‘”</p>
<p>He looked up from gazing into the past. “Bit of context: an hour earlier I saw them run out of patience and take action. Misty let him pull her ears while Bonzer stood behind him. Then Misty went up on her back legs and pushed his chest so he pivoted backward over Bonzer, who turned and put his jaws over the child’s throat and stopped. The kid froze. Bonzer backed off. Kid started to get up but realised there were <em>two</em> dogs over him, rolled over and put his arms around his head. They just sat there keeping him still with the occasional threat for about an hour.”</p>
<p>Forest stretched. </p>
<p>“When I heard them open the door I whistled the dogs, who let the kid go. The kid told his mother who started to go off at me for letting it happen. I told her ‘He was hurting them for fun so they disciplined him, seemed like it was about time someone did’. Boy did <em>that</em> set her off.”</p>
<p>He chuckled, but then his face fell and his voice grew heavy with grief.</p>
<p>“Two years later he was killed by a cattle truck and I buried him, though I could not see through tears. My friends came and helped me dig as we laid him to sleep the last time beneath his tree. And she who never barked at postmen, who did not mark boundaries with urine, who was his constant companion and the mother of his pups, she took on all those duties and did not falter in them until her hips gave out and she could not walk.</p>
<p>Forty years later they live in my dreams. They did not watch the gate: gates were for cars and fences were no barrier, just steel markers. They watched the whole world, day and night. It was their kingdom.”</p>
<p>“What did you learn from him?” It was the right question, and Sophia’s voice was quiet.</p>
<p>“How to be god,” Forest replied simply.</p>
<p>“<em>God!?</em>” It was not an answer she expected.</p>
<p>Forest’s eyes met hers directly. “I saw his eyes open for the first time. I poured my spirit into him and made him in my image. I provided for him, I ruled his world but let him choose. I cared for him and I loved him. I made him more than he was and he returned the favour. I watched him grow and raise children. I watched him age and die. I have watched his children age and die. For them I was immortal and all-powerful, benevolent when I wasn’t capricious and uncaring, wrathful and implacable, merciful. He taught me what it is to be truly free. He taught me how to simply be, and he lives on because I cherish him and keep his memory.”</p>
<p>Sophia didn’t know quite what to say. There were tears welling in the man’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Sometimes he visits me in dreams. Usually to defend me from nightmares, which he does with casual ease. The last time, I said ‘How can you be here? I buried you long ago’ and he spoke with words full of gentle disdain for my folly: ‘I live in you. I’ll always be there when you need me.’. He was better than me in every way. I miss him.”</p>
<p>The silence was long and heavy. Then Forest collected himself and returned to the world.</p>
<p>“That was years ago now. Haven’t dreamed of him since. Haven’t had any nightmares either.”</p>
<p>Sophia had a wry, thoughtful expression, a faint smile playing about her lips.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” asked Eric.</p>
<p>“Forest, thank you for sharing, it was touching and I don’t want answering Eric to offend you.</p>
<p>“I smiled, Eric, because I wondered how all these people would react to learning that they’re the children of dog.”</p>
<p>Forest grinned, raising his glass. “They <em>are</em> the children of dog. He started all this, and they’re fit, loyal, clever, impossible to keep in the yard.”</p>
<p>Eric snorted. “And always hungry.”</p>
<p>Trixie returned with the wine, shaking her head. “Speak for yourselves. I just want a nap in the sun.”</p>
<p>Laughter rippled around the table, and for a moment, the world felt simple and good.</p>
<p>Puttering back down the river road in Forest’s rattling old ute, with Eric asleep in the passenger seat and Autumn tutting about drink driving as an abuse of privilege, but also ready to take over were it actually required, Sophia thought about her own journey. About the kids who couldn’t be kept in a yard, and her place among them at a retired assassin’s private range. </p>
<p>She put the radio on. The signal was terrible but she found a station. In the background, a long-dead Freddy Mercury declared in soaring vocals his burning desire to break free while her thoughts visited kitchen gardens filled with love and compost and re-lived the urgent camaraderie of missions full of booming kerosene fumes and alien death pushed back with blood and cordite and miracle medicine, and the way of life blooming amid the carnage. All of it under the watchful eye of a familiar but unknowable overmind. “Not a leaf shall fall unmarked,” she thought. And then she was home. </p>
<p>The hour was late but she decided to light a fire. Outside, a cold wind shook the canopy and leaves fell, watched in four spectra by the unlikely eyes of nocturnal bees. Janna’s geese honked at marauding quolls and foxes, warnings echoing down the valley.</p>
<p>When the fire died down she raked the coals, banked it and threw a blanket over Eric. She lit a candle for the children of dog, and went to bed.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-46" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Suppose the Worst</h1>
<p>“Hypothetically, what if it <em>doesn’t</em> work?”</p>
<p>Shorty and Ken occupied deck chairs on the raised wooden deck that made roof maintenance a breeze on Ken’s cottage. From there Ken watched his lad in the middle distance, lying on a log over the shallow end of the low dam, fishing for blueclaw with a net and some gristle on a string. Ken watched his boy, happy as Larry, catching his own dinner just because he could. With that realisation a weight lifted and Ken smiled without hesitation for the first time in... Shorty didn’t know. Ever?</p>
<p>Ken sat up in his deck chair and looked straight at Shorty.</p>
<p>“Then we will die on our feet for our own reasons. And until then, <em>he &mdash;</em>” Ken gestured forcefully toward the dam, ” &mdash; will be happy. Let ‘em come. I will be waiting.”</p>
<p>Shorty nodded, cracked a beer each and handed one to Ken.</p>
<p>“I meant after. No money and growing and making everything ourselves is also called subsistence. It’s how medi&aelig;val peasants lived.”</p>
<p>“You don’t believe we can do it?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure we can do all of it.”</p>
<p>“We do it now.”</p>
<p>“Someone drives into town for supplies a dozen times a week.”</p>
<p>“Building supplies. Because we build a lot of stuff.”</p>
<p>Shorty looked down at the home under them. It was an odd combination of stone and timber. half-metre thick mortared granite rock walls rose from where it cut into the slope. Two of them, half a metre apart, the gap full of scavenged styrofoam chunks and builders plastic that dropped into the trenched footings over the tarred rock. Outside the plastic. Uphill, a gentle berm directed groundflow aside from the building and the path leading to it. Built into the wall, a chimney rose with strange angled vents halfway from the ground. He knew what they were. Both men studied war and its craft.</p>
<p>“I still fret about what happens when there are no more trips to town.”</p>
<p>“I don’t,” declared Ken, “There’s nothing there I want.”</p>
<p>He looked down at the home he’d built. The stonework emerged from the hill where it nestled, a cottage in a cave almost. From the grotesque it emerged into the light. Floor-frame became deck, massive beams cut from whole trees cantilevered out as the ground fell away. Partly canopied, it had a sense of soaring, like it belonged among the tree-tops. His boy loved it and would sit with his legs dangling in the warmer months. The whole building was a declaration.</p>
<p>He looked across at the top of the Forest’s chimney. Smoke curled out of it. Given the time of day, the man was probably curing meat, or getting ready to do that. Ken said as much. </p>
<p>“We should go see whether he wants some help.”</p>
<p>When they got there many hands were already making work light. The long-house doors hung wide, sections of the roof lifted to let light in. Half the range mothers were there, making preserves from boxes of citrus fruit. Forest and Oleksiy were chatting seated by a half a lamb that Forest periodically turned over the firepit. Despite the smell of cooking meat it was obvious it would be hours before it was ready. Others cut tomatoes or onions, filling earthen vessels that vanished into the coolroom depths.</p>
<p>Eric and Sophia pored over a diagram. She was planning a home. From time to time their debate grew animated, and Autumn’s presence drone would fire up, the proposed sites and hypothetical works rendered in lilac, changing with the debate.</p>
<p>“Forest! Autumn says stringybark isn’t that great in the ground.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t, but that’s what we have.”</p>
<p>“We also have pine, but she says that’s worse. Much worse. You were telling me about Viking longhouses lasting a thousand years. What were those made of?”</p>
<p>“Pine. <em>Frozen</em> pine. It’s too warm here for pine to last like that.”</p>
<p>“Oh. So what do we do?”</p>
<p>“Fantastic question. So far my best answer is ‘granite’ but mortaring requires calcining which we can’t do yet.”</p>
<p>“Calcining?”</p>
<p>“Making cement from calcium carbonate.”</p>
<p>“Where do we get calcium carbonate?”</p>
<p>“Eggshells.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure the whole damn valley uses <em>that</em> many eggs.”</p>
<p>“Or limestone. Mining.”</p>
<p>“That is <em>way</em> too far in the future for what I need. What can I do to make stringybark last better in the ground?”</p>
<p>“Tar it.”</p>
<p>“Where do we get tar?”</p>
<p>“For your project just buy tarpaint from a hardware store. In the longer term there are other possible sources. You can make it from pine trees, for example. For the really long term we ought to plant ironbark and use that.”</p>
<p>Forest was turning away when inspiration came. He pivoted back.</p>
<p>“The longhouses, I think they charred the pine!” Excited by the prospect of solving a problem, he became very animated. Some wag handed him a beer, to see whether he’d forget and start waving his arms again.</p>
<p>“What you do is char the outside of the timber. Rot is fungus eating sugar. Cellulose is a long chain sugar. But if you char it that changes the chemistry and the fungus can’t get started.”</p>
<p>The finger-counting thing started. “Use stringybark. Cut your pieces and char them. Build a big tub full of turps and soak the timber. After you char and soak, then tar.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like a <em>lot</em> of work, and very expensive.”</p>
<p>“How far you go is determined by how far you want the timber to go. Thousand year longhouse, right?” </p>
<p>He was in full sermon mode. “<em>Building another house</em> is a lot of work. ‘There’s never time to do it right, but there’s always time to do it again.’”</p>
<p>He grinned. “Are you in such a rush to move in that you need to cut corners?”</p>
<p>“Huh. No, I’m not in a rush. But that is a <em>lot</em> of turps.”</p>
<p>“It’s cheaper in big drums.”</p>
<p>“It <em>stinks!</em>”</p>
<p>“Use linseed oil then.”</p>
<p>Sophia looked thoughtful. She liked the scent of linseed oil; it took her back to her grandmother’s house. They returned to their plotting, trusting that an answer of some sort would be found.</p>
<p>Ken found a place by the fire, hefting the cleaver that rested there. As Forest turned the carcass, Ken sliced cooked pieces into a trencher, setting it near the heat with a little spiced oil and a cover so it wouldn’t dry. His boy wandered in with a bucket of crays, presenting them to the ladies and wandering up to greet.</p>
<p>“Hi Dad! I thought I’d find you here.”</p>
<p>“You did?”</p>
<p>“Mum says it’s where you belong.”</p>
<p>“The kitchen?” he looked amused.</p>
<p>“The valley.”</p>
<p>Sophia sat back in her seat, sipping on the ridiculously potent mead that Forest and Oleksiy made in one of the old Slav’s sheds. Every year it was easier to drink; you’d hope so with the amount they made. She wondered whether they were getting better or she was getting used to it. Both, maybe. Certainly her tolerance was higher than it used to be, though that might have had something to do with the nanite treatment Autumn gave her in Glen Innes. She took a longer pull, and wondered out loud what oiled timber might look like with the weight of years, smoothed by endless hands upon it.</p>
<p>The projector on Autumn’s drone lit up, stairs and a rail hanging in space, perfectly imperfect, irregular grain smooth and lustrous, darkly glowing.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you could do colour. Why are you always lilac?”</p>
<p>Ingrid Bergman appeared, sepia toned, half smile like nothing so much as a latter-day sphinx. The image flashed and Cortana’s cheeky face winked conspiracy before lilac motes twinkled into darkness.</p>
<p>Eric lifted his mug, tapping it against hers, and they drank to Autumn’s wisdom, and again to the fallen, then to Forest’s sublime madness and finally the honour of stewardship. Around them silence had fallen and many glasses were raised.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-47" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Alex the Seal</h1>
<p>A long time ago in a university refectory far far away, a young man completely failed to wear a lumberjacket on account of it being two decades in the future. He sat eating dreadful fried food with his friends. They rambled about lectures and their social lives, and periodically played on the pinball machine in the corner. There was a jukebox too. This was so long ago that it was a true jukebox, full of vinyl records. Computers were a thing at this time, but personal computers were still a novelty. The controller in the jukebox might have been digital. It certainly had a mind of its own, and it seemed to like Jimmy Barnes’ <em>No Second Prize</em> and especially The Go-Gos’ <em>Our Lips are Sealed</em>. But the sound was muddy, and the young man in the latent lumberjacket (which was a lot cleaner on account of never having been worn) thought it was “Alex the Seal.” Eventually someone disabused him of this, but he didn’t let that slow him down; “Alex the Seal” was far more amusing.</p>
<p>An astonishing amount of water flowed under various bridges, sometimes with frightening force, and an old man in a filthy, battered lumberjacket stood in the cafeteria of a modular building welcoming an industrial chemist named Alex, who thought he might be able to help them with seals.</p>
<p>The Adams-esque absurdity was not lost on Forest, who owned all five volumes of the Hitchhiker’s Guide trilogy. He thought about sharing this and decided to reserve eccentric weirdness to another day.</p>
<p>“Sheila tells me you belong here, you just haven’t realised it yet.”</p>
<p>Alex didn’t seem to know how to react to that.</p>
<p>The awkwardness stretched into silence. </p>
<p>“Come for a walk. Grab something to eat on the way, if you like. What have we got today, Sally?”</p>
<p>A small, feminine bundle of enthusiasm bounded into action.</p>
<p>“You have got to try these! They had another go at a flour substitute. It doesn’t work for bread but <em>oh my god I have missed almond shortbread!</em>” She bit one, communing with it for a moment before remembering she was getting someone <em>else’s</em> snack. Back she went, stuffing the rest into her mouth and wrapping one each in a napkin for them. </p>
<p>Alex accepted his portion with studied grace, watching Sally, who was oblivious to her own charms and overflowing with enthusiasm for the ongoing flour replacement project started by the valley kids.</p>
<p>“Thish,” she swallowed, “is all his fault.”</p>
<p>Forest looked quizzically at her.</p>
<p>“Barged into a class, gave an impromptu lecture on the perils of monoculture and accidently caused every child in the valley to reject flour while he got half of them in trouble with their mothers.” She waved at a sign on the counter, which read “NO BREAD OR PASTRY, ASK A KID WHY”.</p>
<p>“They got themselves in trouble. Deceiving your mother never ends well.”</p>
<p>“Yeah yeah. It certainly worked out well. That’s why you’re here, Alex. He accidentally created the Range Mothers.”</p>
<p>“The ‘Range Mothers’,” repeated Alex. </p>
<p>“They’ll crack,” said Forest, tone matter of fact. “Kids’ll see to that.” He gestured at the target at the end of the caf.</p>
<p>“Range!” he bellowed, lifting the bow off its rack on the wall and nocking an arrow. He gave it a couple of seconds, drew and loosed. “Ten. I’m out of practice.” He put it back and bellowed “Closed” before fetching the arrow and putting it back, belatedly remembering that this too was eccentric weirdness. Fortunately Sally was attractive and hadn’t flinched, and Alex’s instincts required him to be calm in front of her.</p>
<p>“Righto, girl, we’re off to see the wizard.”</p>
<p>Collecting his battered old hat from the table nearest the door, Forest led Alex out into the sunlight, boots crunching on gravel then silent on the soft verdure of Gerry’s lawn. It was was quiet, Janna waved from her nursery, Oleksiy’s generator coughed in the distance, and Sheila called out from her porch, “Don’t let Forest talk you into fixing his tractor. He’s been threatening it with a sledgehammer for weeks.”</p>
<p>Forest grinned. “There’s plenty wrong with it, but nothing that needs a chemist.”</p>
<p>Janna, hands deep in potting mix, looked up as they approached. “You’re the seal bloke, yeah? If you can stop this pump leaking, I’ll trade you seedlings. Or coffee. Or both.”</p>
<p>Alex knelt, poked at the gaskets. “You’re running fertiliser through it?”</p>
<p>“Mostly. Sometimes fish emulsion. Smells like a crime scene, but the tomatoes love it.”</p>
<p>He sighed. “Seals are not your problem. Your problem is you’re pumping acid through aluminium and it’s dissolving the pump. This is an engineering problem. I don’t know that I can do any thing for <em>this</em> pump but we can probably come up with a more appropriate pump.”</p>
<p>Janna wiped her hands on her jeans. “That’d be good. If you see anything you fancy, let me know. I give the extras to whoever’ll make best use of them, or just to folks who look like they need a bit of green.” She tucked a basil plant into Forest’s basket, then handed Alex a sprig of mint. “Try that in your tea. It’s good for nerves.”</p>
<p>Forest accepted a handful of beans from a passing neighbour, who winked at Alex. “You’re new. Welcome. If you need eggs, see Sheila. If you need a hand, ask anyone. Except Forest—he’ll put you to work.”</p>
<p>Oleksiy was next, hunched over a rainwater tank, muttering in Ukrainian. He looked up, squinted. “Forest brings me chemist. Good. This sealant is rubbish.”</p>
<p>Alex examined the seam, offered a quiet explanation about chemical compatibility. Oleksiy listened, then thumped him on the shoulder. “You’ll do.”</p>
<p>The old Slav eyed Alex with new interest. “You shoot?”</p>
<p>Alex blinked. “I’ve never held a gun in my life.”</p>
<p>Oleksiy grunted, half amused, half approving. “We teach you. Here, everyone learns. Basic skill.”</p>
<p>Sissi appeared, rare as rain in summer, her voice gentle but firm. “Is important. Plant beast. You come Thursday, children learn. You learn. He teach you safe, teach you right.”</p>
<p>Alex nodded, uncertain but willing. “Alright. I’ll be there.”</p>
<p>Forest looked very pleased. “Good man.”</p>
<p>As they walked, Alex watched the easy flow of produce, tools, and favours — beans for eggs, seedlings for repairs, pickles for gate-fixing. No money, just a steady current of gifts and help. Forest accepted a jar of pickles from Rebecca, promising to fix her gate. Janna handed Alex a bag of fresh herbs, unsolicited. Oleksiy offered a ride to town.</p>
<p>A group of Indians who looked like they might be related turned up, fronted by an intense, quiet young woman who shyly asked “Are you Alex? I’m Priya.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s me. Why?”</p>
<p>Priya looked at her husband and her father, who smiled support and said nothing, waiting for her to gather her courage and beat down learned habits that no longer served them well. She wasn’t entirely comfortable, she was the youngest and she was a girl. Her father was also more qualified. But it was her idea and they wanted her to continue to lead, in this strange place that exalted competence and courage.</p>
<p>“We, um, we’re the team who figured out the fish stocking problem.”</p>
<p>“The ‘fish stocking’ problem,′ repeated Alex, wondering what stockings had to do with fish.</p>
<p>“Yes, in the dams they do not breed, it is because there is no current. But we do not need them to breed in the dams, only there to grow and so we have built a hatchery from our aquariums. But it is not enough and we must expand, not too quickly and not so soon.”</p>
<p>“Interesting, but what does this have to do with me?”</p>
<p>“We need stable, supple seals we can make ourselves, for the pipes, for the pumps, for the tanks. When the fish can not be breeding in the dams our tanks are so much more than hobbies. We have found the answer, we must not lose it. We do not need your answer now, but need it we will, so very much. And a difficult thing it will be, the fish are so sensitive to contaminants. We will need many trials.”</p>
<p>Alex stared at her.</p>
<p>“So you’ve brought a material science problem to a materials scientist, a problem that will take years to solve, and you’ve had the sense to bring it years before you need the solution, and you even know it’s going to be failure after failure until we get it right.”</p>
<p>He swung around and stared at Forest, and Oleksiy, and the transgenerational delegation of aquaculturists.</p>
<p>Alex watched the valley settle, the quiet hum of evening. “I think I can get used to this.”</p>
<p>And then Ken turned up with his lad. They brought boxes and boxes of washed bottles and caps. Oleksiy opened the booze-dungeon and the bottles disappeared into the gloom, apparently transmuted into a big bottle of amber mead and some glasses. </p>
<p>Drinks were poured and handed around, glasses raised to a new chap and a fresh batch. </p>
<p>“Bit cloudy still.”</p>
<p>“One thing at a time. I reckon we’ve got the sweetness right now.”</p>
<p>“Yep, you could even back off a bit and leave it sweeter, just a tad.</p>
<p>“Twenty-three days then, for early Spring. Hey, you know what else should be ready? Roll-mops!”</p>
<p>“The last lot were alright but they had a weird muddy taste.”</p>
<p>Forest ignored this and charged enthusastically into the gloom, returning with a huge glass bottle full of pickled salt-fish.</p>
<p>Priya became animated.</p>
<p>“Yes, this muddy flavour is from living in the dams. But Forest has come to us and Autumn has helped with some large tanks. We have been keeping some adult fish in the cleaner water. For five days, we have found it does the trick.”</p>
<p>She gestured at the bottle Forest was busily trying to open.</p>
<p>“Are these the same fish, Forest?”</p>
<p>He didn’t reply immediately, busily stuffing one into his face. Eventually he finished and spoke.</p>
<p>“Yep.” He speared another one. Clearly they were much improved. Oleksiy took some before Forest could scarf the lot.</p>
<p>Alex connected the dots. “You plan to ferment your own vinegar, don’t you. Where are you going to get the salt so far from the sea?”</p>
<p>Forest thought about the long term truth. He certainly had an answer, but it was couched in a world-view and an expected future that Alex probably wasn’t ready to hear. He decided not to sully the present with necessary evils. “Have to buy it in town. Eventually we’ll work something else out.”</p>
<p>He pushed the jar over.</p>
<p>“Try one.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“This one is Murray Cod.” Constitutionally incapable of rejecting an audience, Forest switched into lecture mode. “While the state exists we can only stock the dams with natives. Unlike most government rules this one isn’t completely stupid; when we flood here it ends up in the Murray Darling catchment, fish, crabs, everything. The cod I picked because they’re on the approved list. What I didn’t know is they’re apex predators. Can’t keep anything else in the dam, they eat it.”</p>
<p>“While the state exists?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Laws.”</p>
<p>“What would you do if it stopped existing?”</p>
<p>“Everything. And that’s the problem. No more hare-brained regulations but we’d have to do <em>everything,</em> and we are nowhere near ready for that.”</p>
<p>“What are you really doing out here?”</p>
<p>“If I said ‘building an ark’ it would be melodramatic but accurate and succinct.”</p>
<p>“They said you <em>weren’t</em> survivalists.”</p>
<p>“Depends what you mean by ‘survivalist’. We aren’t stuffing a fallout shelter with tins. Suppose you did that and the world did stop. What do you do when you run out of tins? It’s not like the shops will re-open on Tuesday. We’re more about a different approach to values.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen that already. But you said it was more like an ark, which is a very survivalist thing to say.”</p>
<p>“You’re a well educated bloke. Civilisations rise, and then they fall again. Over and over, without exception. Before you say ‘China,’ Imperial China collapsed due to the economic and technological influence of the west. So... civilisations rise and then they fall. Fair statement?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so.”</p>
<p>“Why? They’re all different. Circumstances vary, people and values vary, but without exception they rise and they fall. And if you’re still thinking China lasted a lot longer than most <em>something</em> is the same across them all.”</p>

<blockquote><p>“Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime. Give a man a 3D printer and he’ll spend three weeks trying to print fish.”<br>
— Terry Pratchett (apocryphal)</p>
</blockquote><hr>
<p>Eloise leaned back against the wall of the caf, rubbing her eyes, then her whole head because it felt like it would burst. She was skimming through the reboot guide. One of a dozen volumes, supported by hundreds and hundreds of textbooks. </p>
<p>The pages swam before her eyes, dense with diagrams and formulas that should have made sense but somehow didn’t quite connect. She’d been at it for three hours straight, and her brain felt like overcooked porridge.</p>
<p>Sheila brought her more coffee and a wrap. They still hadn’t got flour right but unleavened bread seemed to work.</p>
<p>“You’re pushing too hard,” Sheila said quietly, setting the plate down. “When did you last take a proper break?”</p>
<p>Eloise couldn’t remember. She leaned forward, head in her hands and muttered out through her fingers.</p>
<p>“I have a fucking degree, you know. A bach of mech eng. It wasn’t just a bit of paper either, I designed shop floor automation and it bloody well worked. Actual factories making actual things that people bought and used.”</p>
<p>“Yes? That’s why you read this stuff so much faster than the rest of us. You don’t know how grateful we are to have you explaining it to us.”</p>
<p>“I feel like a goddamn child. There’s so <em>much</em>.” Eloise gestured helplessly at the stack of volumes. “Yesterday I was trying to understand the metallurgy chapter and it referenced seventeen different alloy compositions, each with their own heat treatment protocols, and every single one depends on precise atmospheric controls during forging that we can’t maintain without...” She made a frustrated noise. “Without industrial infrastructure we don’t have and can’t build because we don’t have the tools to make the tools to make the tools.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You are trying to stuff the entire know-how of a technological civilisation into one head, Eloise. You aren’t just standing on the shoulders of giants, you’re trying to be all the giants at once. That you aren’t failing miserably is an extraordinary display of intellectual prowess.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“<em>You</em> seem to manage.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>...Yes. But I am bringing to bear considerably greater computational and storage resources than your entire civilisation. You’re trying to do it with one organic brain.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Ellie decided to think about coffee instead of mortal limits. The bitter taste was familiar, grounding. She noticed several of the range mothers had drifted closer, listening intently to the exchange. Rebecca, Sarah, and Monica formed a loose semicircle around the table where the textbooks lay splayed open like accusatory evidence. Autumn turned above her presence drone, facing them.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Can I ask why you invited me?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Rebecca spoke for the group, her usual directness cutting through any diplomatic hedging. “We’re struggling. Time is of the essence. You could probably do something and you don’t. No doubt there’s some reason for that which we haven’t figured out but to be honest some days I wonder what’s the point when you can always do everything quicker and better. I kinda feel outclassed when Ellie looks at those hieroglyphics in the textbooks and just knows what it means... and she feels outclassed by you.”</p>
<p>Sarah shifted her youngest to her other hip. “We’ve been at this for months now. Monica’s getting ulcers from the stress, I’m not sleeping, and yesterday Rebecca threw a spanner at the wall when she couldn’t make the pump thingy go back on.”</p>
<p>“Housing,” corrected Rebecca. “And I missed. Which pissed me off even more.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>To be frank I don’t really understand why you haven’t asked for more help.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“We can’t depend on anything the community can’t support, but even with it laid out for us in the books there’s just so <em>much!</em> We’ll never get enough specialists lined up. And we can’t ask <em>you</em> for a space magic fix, that just <em>moves</em> the dependency.”</p>
<p>Monica spoke up from behind Sarah, voice quiet but carrying. “It’s not even about pride anymore. Well, not just pride. If the community can’t understand it, can’t maintain it, can’t teach the next generation how it works... what happens when you’re not here?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Your children depend on you. They will not always. Are you not proud of how they grow? Why should I think less of you, when every day you make me proud? You will find your own way. If you fall, I will see it. And then I will pick you up, dust you off and watch while you try again.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The silence stretched, heavy with something Eloise couldn’t quite name. She saw Rebecca blink rapidly, and Sarah’s grip tighten on her child. Even Monica’s shoulders had relaxed slightly.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I do, however, have a question. You are right to reject things you can’t make, but why don’t you ask Forest to buy a Class II fabber and a blueprint for a Class II fabber? Then you’d be able to make more Class II fabbers and you’d be truly independent. You’d still have to power them, but that’s the sort of project that will have the boys happily building steam engines and armatures. If you’re lucky.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>They stared at her, flabbergasted.</p>
<p>“A what now?” Sarah said faintly.</p>
<p>“Wait, back up,” Rebecca managed. “You can make the machine that makes the machine?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You don’t have to use it for everything, you know. You can just buy blueprints to fill gaps for things that otherwise require a huge industrial pyramid, like silicone sealant for example.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>The explosion was immediate and fierce.</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what we’re talking about!” Monica’s voice cracked like a whip. “We’d have this magic box that just... makes things! Where’s the learning in that? Where’s the understanding?”</p>
<p>“But if we can make our own blueprints—” Sarah started.</p>
<p>“Can we, though?” Rebecca cut in. “Really? Or would we just be playing with alien toys, pretending we understand them?”</p>
<p>“It’s not pretending if it works,” Eloise said, surprising herself by jumping into the fray. “When I designed factory automation, I didn’t design electric motors. I worked out the required characteristics and chose them from <em>catalogues</em>. Does that word ring any bells?” The pointed way she used the word made her meaning very clear.</p>
<p>“That’s different,” Monica shot back. “You understood motors. You could fix them, improve them, teach someone else how they worked.”</p>
<p>“Could I, though?” Eloise found herself leaning forward, energized by the argument. “I mean, I understood the principles, sure. But could I have wound copper wire and laminated steel cores from scratch? Made the magnets? It’s not like I have half a tonne of neodymium ore in my shed. I don’t even know where they mine it, much less how to extract it.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>That’s in one of the books you got from the Reboot Catalogue.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Yes, thank you Autumn. I’m sure that will be very important in fifty years.” Eloise continued making her point. </p>
<p>“Then there’s the controller chips. Step one, make a huge atomically pure silicon crystal and slice it into flawless wafers. That’s beyond most current human nations. </p>
<p>“Look, in my old job, I had suppliers. Specialists. People who knew motors better than I ever would. The question isn’t whether I personally could make every component - it’s whether the supply chain was supportable.”</p>
<p>A nod.</p>
<p>“What sort of wire should you use? How thick? How many turns will you need? I imagine you’ve seen the windings on an armature &mdash;” she interrupted herself, searching for simpler words, ” &mdash; the copper wire inside an electric motor?”</p>
<p>“We made one in highschool by winding wire around a pencil. There were 50 turns, as I remember. But it wasn’t very strong. We showed it worked using a magnetic compass and then iron filings on paper.”</p>
<p>Monica looked puzzled. “You just reminded me of something I always wanted to ask but I kept forgetting. Why doesn’t it need insulation? You’d think it would short but it works so I guess it doesn’t. Why?”</p>
<p>“Great question. It <em>does</em> have insulation. It’s clear lacquer. And no, I don’t know what that’s made of. Or why it doesn’t crack and fall off when you bend the wire.”</p>
<p>Rebecca was shaking her head. “This is exactly the problem. Where does it end? Do we need to mine our own copper? Smelt our own steel? At what point do we have enough local expertise to maintain what we’re using?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The same point your children are allowed to use language they didn’t invent,</em> Autumn said gently. <em>The same point they’re allowed to benefit from your love without having earned it.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That’s not the same thing,” Sarah protested, but her voice lacked conviction.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Isn’t it? Every tool you use, every technique you learn, builds on the work of others. The question isn’t whether you made it yourself. The question is whether your community understands it well enough to use it wisely, maintain it properly, and teach others to do the same. Look, everything’s made in China these days, right? Do you think blacksmiths are still an essential part of their manufacturing economy or do you think they were part of the bootstrap process and then decommissioned?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Monica was quiet for a long moment, then: “But what if we get dependent on it? What if we stop trying to figure things out for ourselves?”</p>
<p>“Then you’d become lazy and useless,” Rebecca said bluntly. “Which you won’t, because that’s not who any of you are. Hell, Monica, you spent six weeks trying to get that water pump working instead of asking for help. You think you’d suddenly turn into couch potatoes because we had better tools?”</p>
<p>Eloise was thinking furiously, her engineer’s mind finally clicking into gear. “Could we create our own blueprints? How does that work? Is it like when I would design machinery and produce 3D models and print them? The first one was slow but then we’d use it to make moulds and set up for production runs?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>You could use it like that. The kind of blueprints normally used are for complete, assembled complex machinery, but you could use it as a big 3D printer I suppose.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“So we could design our own improvements,” Eloise continued, warming to the idea. “Take existing blueprints and modify them. Learn by doing, but with better tools.”</p>
<p>“Wait,” Rebecca interrupted, her practical mind catching up. “What does it use for materials? I mean, you can’t just magic iridium out of thin air, right? If I want to make iridium spark plugs, I still need actual iridium to feed into this thing?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Of course. It’s not a replicator from a science fiction show. You need to provide all the raw materials. It’s more like a very, very precise automated workshop than actual magic.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Right,” Eloise said, nodding. “So we’d still need to source materials, understand what we’re working with, plan our projects around what we can actually get.”</p>
<p>“That’s... actually better,” Monica said slowly. “We’d still have to understand material properties, still have to think about supply chains and substitutions.”</p>
<p>“And recycling,” Sarah added. “We’d probably get really good at breaking down old machinery to recover rare elements.”</p>
<p>“Actually,” Eloise said, her engineering mind kicking into gear, “we’d have access to materials that would make ancient civilizations weep with envy. Think about it - every abandoned city is a massive stockpile of refined metals. Mountains of solar panels full of silver, cars packed with steel and copper and aluminum. And the electronics...” She gestured excitedly. “Every smartphone, every computer, every piece of consumer electronics is loaded with rare earth elements that used to be incredibly difficult to extract. Neodymium, dysprosium, terbium - stuff that’s normally scattered as trace elements in ore, but concentrated and purified in every device.”</p>
<p>Rebecca was nodding slowly. “So instead of needing massive mining operations and refineries, we’d be salvaging materials that are already processed and ready to use.”</p>
<p>“Exactly! The collapse would leave us sitting on the richest material deposits in human history. We wouldn’t be struggling to find materials for the fabber - we’d be swimming in them. You do <em>not</em> want to mine iridium. It’s four times rarer than gold. But you don’t need to, just pull the spark plugs out of fancy cars.”</p>
<p>“What’s iridium?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>An engineer’s wet dream. Strong, hard, conducts heat and electricity well, incorruptible and sticks to iron like shit on a blanket.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Monica: “That sounds difficult to work with too. Like, if it’s super hard etc how do you shape it?”</p>
<p>Eloise grinned and channelled Forest: “A right bastard to work with.” Her impression was terrible and funnier as a result. They all giggled.</p>
<p>“That man knows so much. I don’t know how his head doesn’t explode.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Forest likes to think of himself as a man for all seasons. Or a useless dilettante, depending on whether today’s doofy idea is working. His memory is actually terrible, but he has me. And if you’re one of those people in awe of his hand-made tool handles, which actually do live up the the legend, don’t look at his attempts at cabinetry... unless you need a laugh.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Sarah looked thoughtful. “Jack of all trades, master of none? There may be a lesson in there. Like... start with simple things? Things we already understand?”</p>
<p>“And work our way up,” Monica said slowly. “Use it to make the precise parts we can’t forge by hand, but still understand every component.”</p>
<p>Rebecca was nodding. “It’s not replacing our brains. It’s replacing our hammers and lathes.”</p>
<p>“Better hammers and lathes,” Eloise corrected. “Much better. But we still need specialists. Behind every good engineer is a line of scientists arguing about why Forest’s stupid idea works.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The choice is yours,</em> Autumn said. <em>But remember — your children will inherit whatever decision you make. Do you want them to inherit your struggles, or your wisdom?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>They argued for hours, but it was happier and it went somewhere. Eventually they asked Autumn not to suggest the Class II fabber idea to Forest unless things were dire. Eloise looked more than a little disappointed. She was warming to the idea of engineering with a literally out-of-this-world 3D printer.</p>
<p>Then someone asked Autumn whether there was anyone they could talk to with experience of using this sort of gear. The answer was, surprisingly, ‘Forest’.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Dusty had one of them,” Forest said when they eventually found him and brought up the subject. “They’re not much use for fancy stuff unless it’s busted and you want another one the same, otherwise you’re on a bit of a quest for rare stuff.”</p>
<p>“Were you planning to <em>mention</em> this at any point?”</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>“<em>When?</em>”</p>
<p>”’Bout ten minutes after you ran out of ideas. You’re doing a way better job of this than I was. Far be it for me to rain on your parade, or break the creative flow.”</p>
<p>“God, you are such a <em>shit!</em>”</p>
<p>“Yeah Trixie says that.”</p>
<p>“Fix the flour thing. Or I will send an army of pie-deprived children to pester you.”</p>
<p>“Talk to Autumn. Flour is mostly simple carbohydrates. A Class II fabber should be able to make flour from leaf litter.” He left.</p>
<p>After a lengthy, non-plussed paused, she said “Could it?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Absolutely, in the same way that Leonardo da Vinci could paint walls: slowly, inefficiently and expensively, with a waste of talent verging on the criminal.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>They broke up and went their various ways on the multitude of errands that make up the day of a mother and housekeeper, but the debate never stopped. Like madwomen they spoke to the air, apparently fearless of circling clouds of bees. A closer look might show them talking <em>to</em> the bees.</p>
<p>“If a fabber is ok because that’s where a tech bootstrap is going anyway, why didn’t you <em>lead</em> with that?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The problem with the fabber, as you ladies rightly pointed out, is you don’t know how it works and it’s too big a jump. You need intellectual stairs.</em></p>
<p><em>Eloise is attempting the educational equivalent of free-climbing the outside of a skyscraper with nothing but grit and the bloody-minded determination for which humans are famous. She will likely fail, yet I will not undermine her glorious ambition. She reminds me of Forest’s dog: she cannot imagine defeat and may yet surprise us all.</em></p>
<p><em>But exceptional people do not live forever, so it is more important that the fabber is within the reach of a people. Mostly this is an exercise in setting up a culture with a mentality that insists on understanding. You will need specialists, and that means you have to be able to support them without centralising. Thus, villages with specialties, sharing and cooperating.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>She stood at this summit of understanding with the world laid out before her, vast and unexplored. For a moment it was terrifying. Then in her mind’s eye, night fell. A network of twinkles stretched to the horizon, each a village with their bizarre dualism of generalism and specialisation. The spark behind her eyes lit a flame in her heart. Like Mao, she took the first step on a long march. Unlike Mao, they would be building up and exalting the learned.</p>
<p>Autumn spread this framed insight, first helping them ask the right question, or steering them to others who already knew. Except for Eloise, focussed as she was on her own transcendance.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Don’t let her burn out. But we cannot take this from her. Who knows, perhaps in time the horse will sing. It certainly wants to.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn wondered how far Ellie would get on her own, and whether she would eventually choose the machine gift, with its small but significant risk of losing her creative spark. Her own choice was long in the past, but also fresh and vibrant: she cherished it and thought of it not as a loss of what was but an ascension. Easy to be complacent about a thing that hadn’t happened. She decided not to push.</p>
<p>Two days later, Eloise found she just had to know.</p>
<p>“Autumn?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, Ellie?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“You said high power demand would have the boys building steam engines, ‘if we’re lucky’. What did you mean by ‘If we’re lucky’?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Forest is just as likely to have a crack at fusion.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That sounds like gross overkill.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If you want to build and maintain it yourselves, it’s completely ridiculous. As I’m sure you’re aware, at a human level of tech, there are only two fundamental ways to generate electricity: spinning armatures and photovoltaic arrays.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“We do also know how to build a hydrogen fuel cell.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do you have any effective reliable cheap way to store hydrogen that doesn’t involve hydrocarbons?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“No.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Apart from PVAs, all your generators work by spinning an armature in a magnetic field. This generally involves steam in a turbine. Sometimes it’s geothermal steam, and in a handful of cases you let water run downhill through the turbine. But mostly, it’s steam. Thing gets hot, steam spins turbine, turbine spins armature. Forest gets bored, lads build turbine, Forest badgers me for low temperature fusion.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“That doesn’t sound like a good use of their time, at least not until we’re well set up.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Quite. I expect that just as the turbines are ready a hive will break out and they’ll have to put their toys away and sort it out.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Do you get tired of constantly having to herd us toward right choices?”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I don’t constantly herd you toward right choices. From time to time I herd you away from really bad choices. Once this budding culture is established I won’t even do that unless the consequences are dire.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“Um...”</p>
<p>Eloise had weird body language. She looked like she wanted to ask for a date.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes?</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Ellie chewed her lip. </p>
<p>“Forest said there are augmentations that can help me remember more and think faster.”</p>
<p>Internally Autumn punched the air; now she <em>knew</em> Ellie was a kindred soul. Externally, her presence drone started projecting her as a devil sitting on Ellie’s shoulder, voluptuous and available.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Oh yes indeed, there most certainly are.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Autumn’s voice was an odd kind of warning; sultry almost. The voice of temptation.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I should warn you: for people like us that sort of thing can be... addictive. Because it works. And depending on how far you go, there is a small but real chance of losing yourself.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Eloise gazed into an impossible future that bore down on her like a freight train on the rails of her own desire. In a small voice she asked “But you’d be there, right?” </p>
<p>The smile over the presence drone had more than warmth in it. She wouldn’t be alone.</p>

<p>Civilisation.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherers, in clans, extended family, tribal and nomadic.</p>
<p>The invention of agriculture; man bending the world to his will, rather than adapting. </p>
<p>Settled in place, few things threaten. What <em>can?</em> We strive in concert, till our collective strength is geological in scale. With works of dam and road, on ever greater scale we master the wild and force it to submit.</p>
<p>And yet, without fail, we rise up! Only to fall again. And the night is long, as only those who dwell in it could truly tell.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>We know why civilisation rises; it’s obvious. A few good seasons, men band together and their strength multiplies. The only real threat is other men. But why is it inevitable that they fall again, they who are so mighty?</p>
<h2 id="id-51">Episode 1: Egypt - Gift of the River</h2>
<p><em>FADE IN: Aerial shot of the Nile Delta at sunrise, golden light reflecting off countless irrigation channels. The camera follows the river south, past modern Cairo, past the pyramids, into the heart of ancient Egypt.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> For three thousand years, Egypt endured. Three millennia—longer than the span from Homer to the present day. But what made them great also made them brittle.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Animation showing the annual flood cycle. Waters rise, recede, leave rich black soil.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Nile was their fortune and their foundation, flooding each year with clockwork precision, depositing rich silt across the delta, turning desert into the granary of the ancient world.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Pre-dynastic Egypt, circa 3500 BCE. Small farming villages dotted along the Nile. VILLAGE CHIEF KHETI addresses his people.</em></p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE CHIEF KHETI:</strong> The flood comes higher this season than any in memory. We have grain enough for three villages.</p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE ELDER:</strong> Should we not store it for lean years?</p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE CHIEF KHETI:</strong> Why? The Nile gives. The Nile always gives. Better to share our bounty with villages upstream.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Same location, fifty years later. The village has grown into a small town. KHETI’S SON, now REGIONAL GOVERNOR KHETI, meets with representatives from multiple villages.</em></p>
<p><strong>GOVERNOR KHETI:</strong> Six villages now look to us for coordination. We manage the canals, we organize the harvest, we store the surplus.</p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE REPRESENTATIVE ANKHU:</strong> Our people prosper under your leadership. But some ask—why should one village command others?</p>
<p><strong>GOVERNOR KHETI:</strong> Because coordination multiplies strength. Alone, each village might feed itself. Together, we build granaries that could feed Memphis itself.</p>
<p><em>Montage: Time-lapse showing villages growing into towns, towns into cities, regional governors becoming more powerful.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Success bred hierarchy. Prosperity enabled specialization. Those who coordinated the abundance became more important than those who created it.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Recreation of early Egyptian farmers working the fertile fields, contrasted with shots of surrounding desert.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Here was abundance made predictable, scarcity transformed into certainty. Where other peoples scratched precarious livings from reluctant soil, Egyptians learned to harness the rhythm of the river itself.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Interior of a primitive dwelling, circa 3200 BCE. A VILLAGE ELDER draws lines in the sand, teaching young men about flood patterns.</em></p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE ELDER:</strong> Count the days from when the star Sopdet appears at dawn. Seven tens of days, then the flood comes. Always. The gods have given us this gift.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG FARMER:</strong> But what if the flood is late? What if it does not come?</p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE ELDER:</strong> <em>(confident)</em> It always comes. Plan your planting, plan your harvest, plan your life around this truth.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Memphis palace, circa 3100 BCE. KING MENES, first pharaoh of unified Egypt, addresses his council.</em></p>
<p><strong>KING MENES:</strong> Upper and Lower Egypt are now one kingdom. The Nile’s gifts shall be shared from the first cataract to the Great Green Sea.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF MINISTER:</strong> Majesty, ruling both lands requires unprecedented coordination. No king has commanded such territory.</p>
<p><strong>KING MENES:</strong> Then we must create new institutions. Royal governors for each nome, scribes to record every transaction, priests to ensure the gods’ favor.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH PRIEST OF PTAH:</strong> The gods smile upon unity, Majesty. But they will require proper recognition of your divine nature.</p>
<p><strong>KING MENES:</strong> Divine nature?</p>
<p><strong>HIGH PRIEST OF PTAH:</strong> You do not merely rule Egypt—you ARE Egypt. The Nile floods at your command, the sun rises at your pleasure. This is the price and privilege of unification.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Ceremony where Menes is crowned as god-king. The crowd prostrates itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Centralization required mythology. To justify concentration of power, the pharaohs became more than kings—they became gods walking among mortals, wielding power both temporal and divine.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Construction site of the Great Pyramid, circa 2580 BCE. Thousands of workers move massive stone blocks with copper tools and wooden levers. KHUFU’s ARCHITECT supervises.</em></p>
<p><strong>ARCHITECT:</strong> The pyramid must rise two hundred and thirty cubits at the base, one hundred and forty-six cubits high. It will be visible from the Nile itself, a testament to the god-king’s power.</p>
<p><strong>FOREMAN:</strong> The workers complain the stones are too heavy, the slope too steep.</p>
<p><strong>ARCHITECT:</strong> Then bring more workers. The Nile provides endless harvest, endless hands. What is impossible for other men is merely difficult for Egypt.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Workers’ village near the pyramid. CHIEF FOREMAN HEMIUNU addresses a gathering of exhausted laborers.</em></p>
<p><strong>HEMIUNU:</strong> You build not just a tomb, but eternity itself. When the god-king Khufu journeys to the stars, this pyramid will ensure the Nile keeps flooding, the sun keeps rising.</p>
<p><strong>WORKER SENEB:</strong> The stones grow heavier each year. My father built temples with smaller blocks.</p>
<p><strong>HEMIUNU:</strong> Your father built for mortal pharaohs. We build for a living god. The work must match the majesty.</p>
<p><strong>WORKER SENEB:</strong> But why must it be so large? So complex?</p>
<p><strong>HEMIUNU:</strong> Because Egypt can build it. Because no other nation on earth possesses our organization, our resources, our divine mandate. We build big because we are big.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Royal court during pyramid construction. KHUFU reviews reports with his officials.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROYAL TREASURER:</strong> Majesty, the pyramid consumes one-tenth of Egypt’s annual harvest in feeding workers alone.</p>
<p><strong>KHUFU:</strong> And?</p>
<p><strong>ROYAL TREASURER:</strong> Perhaps a smaller monument would still proclaim your divinity while preserving resources for other needs.</p>
<p><strong>KHUFU:</strong> Other needs? What need is greater than ensuring my successful journey to the afterlife? Without that, the Nile stops flooding, chaos returns, Egypt dies.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF MINISTER:</strong> But Majesty, some provinces report strain from providing their quotas of workers and materials.</p>
<p><strong>KHUFU:</strong> Then they learn their duty to their god. The pyramid is not expense—it is investment in Egypt’s eternal prosperity.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Finished pyramid against starlit sky. Camera pulls back to reveal all three pyramids of Giza.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The great pyramid at Giza—built when the world was young—remains the most massive stone structure ever raised by human hands. But observe what it represents: the complete subordination of an entire civilization to a single project, a single vision, a single man’s conception of immortality.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Memphis palace, years after Khufu’s death. PHARAOH KHAFRE, Khufu’s successor, addresses his court.</em></p>
<p><strong>KHAFRE:</strong> My pyramid must surpass my father’s in magnificence.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF ARCHITECT:</strong> Majesty, we could build it slightly smaller but use finer materials, more complex internal chambers—</p>
<p><strong>KHAFRE:</strong> Larger. Higher. More magnificent. If Egypt could build my father’s pyramid, surely we have grown strong enough to surpass it.</p>
<p><strong>ROYAL TREASURER:</strong> <em>(hesitant)</em> Majesty, the kingdom prospers, but the resources required...</p>
<p><strong>KHAFRE:</strong> Will be provided. What is Egypt’s wealth for, if not to proclaim Egypt’s power? Every stone quarried, every worker fed, every copper tool forged—all proclaims to the world that Egypt fears no challenge, faces no limit.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Construction of the second pyramid. Even more elaborate organization, even more workers, even more complex logistics.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Success demanded surpassing success. Each pharaoh needed to outdo his predecessor, each monument to exceed the last. Pyramid building became pyramid competitions—competitions Egypt was determined never to lose.</p>

<p><strong>KHAFRE:</strong> My pyramid must surpass my father’s in magnificence.</p>

<p><em>Cut to: Construction of the second pyramid. Even more elaborate organization, even more workers, even more complex logistics.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Success demanded surpassing success. Each pharaoh needed to outdo his predecessor, each monument to exceed the last. Pyramid building became pyramid competitions—competitions Egypt was determined never to lose.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Egyptian metallurgy workshop, circa 2000 BCE. MASTER METALSMITH KHNUM demonstrates bronze-working to apprentices.</em></p>
<p><strong>KHNUM:</strong> Copper from Sinai, tin from distant lands. Mix them thus, and bronze is born—harder than copper, sharper than stone.</p>
<p><strong>APPRENTICE:</strong> Master, the traders speak of peoples far north who work a metal called iron.</p>
<p><strong>KHNUM:</strong> Iron? A crude metal that rusts and crumbles. Bronze is eternal, like Egypt herself. Why should we concern ourselves with barbarian metals?</p>
<p><strong>APPRENTICE:</strong> But they say iron weapons cut through bronze—</p>
<p><strong>KHNUM:</strong> <em>(interrupting)</em> They say many things. Egyptian bronze has armed the pharaoh’s armies for a thousand years. It has conquered Nubia, subdued the Levant, humbled all who oppose us.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Egyptian army camp, circa 1500 BCE. Bronze weapons gleam in firelight. GENERAL THUTMOSE addresses his officers.</em></p>
<p><strong>GENERAL THUTMOSE:</strong> Our enemies fight with stone and wood. We carry weapons of bronze, forged in fires they cannot imagine. Our scribes record victories they cannot even spell.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN AMENEMHEB:</strong> Should we not share these gifts? Make allies of our enemies?</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL THUTMOSE:</strong> Why? Egypt is sufficient unto itself. Let them learn submission. That is gift enough.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN AMENEMHEB:</strong> But General, some of our enemies are learning to work bronze themselves. The Hittites forge weapons nearly as fine as ours.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL THUTMOSE:</strong> Nearly. But not equal. And never better. Egyptian craftsmanship is blessed by the gods themselves.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Hittite kingdom, same period. HITTITE KING SUPPILULIUMA addresses his metalworkers.</em></p>
<p><strong>SUPPILULIUMA:</strong> The Egyptians hoard their knowledge like treasure. But we have learned their techniques and improved upon them.</p>
<p><strong>HITTITE METALSMITH:</strong> My king, we have developed this new metal—iron. Harder than bronze, more plentiful than copper.</p>
<p><strong>SUPPILULIUMA:</strong> Show me.</p>
<p><em>The metalsmith demonstrates iron weapons cutting through bronze shields.</em></p>
<p><strong>SUPPILULIUMA:</strong> And the Egyptians?</p>
<p><strong>HITTITE METALSMITH:</strong> They dismiss it as barbarian work. They believe bronze will always suffice.</p>
<p><strong>SUPPILULIUMA:</strong> Then we have an advantage they refuse to see. Prepare the armies.</p>
<p><em>Montage: Egyptian influence spreading. Trade routes, diplomatic missions, tributary kingdoms.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Their armies carried bronze weapons when their enemies still fought with stone, their scribes kept records in halls of learning when most of the world could neither read nor write. From Nubia to the Levant, their influence shaped the ancient world.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Egyptian diplomatic mission, circa 1400 BCE. AMBASSADOR AMENHOTEP meets with Mesopotamian rulers.</em></p>
<p><strong>MESOPOTAMIAN KING:</strong> Egypt’s influence grows, but so does resistance. Many nations grow weary of Egyptian dominance.</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR AMENHOTEP:</strong> Resistance is the luxury of the weak. Egypt seeks not to rule the world, but to order it properly.</p>
<p><strong>MESOPOTAMIAN KING:</strong> And if nations prefer their own order?</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR AMENHOTEP:</strong> Then they prefer chaos. Egypt brings civilization, law, prosperity. Those who reject these gifts reject reason itself.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Maps showing Egyptian trade networks and tributary states.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> But observe how success bred assumptions. Egyptian superiority wasn’t just military or economic—it became cultural, intellectual, spiritual. The idea that others might have something to teach Egypt became literally unthinkable.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Temple of Amun-Ra, circa 1200 BCE. Elaborate ceremony in progress. HIGH PRIEST AMENHOTEP conducts rituals before massive golden statues.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Yet observe the paradox: the very gift that made them great contained the seeds of their destruction. The Nile’s predictability bred institutional thinking. Success became routine, innovation unnecessary.</p>
<p><em>Camera focuses on the priests, then the bureaucrats, then the pharaoh himself—all removed from the common people.</em></p>
<p><strong>HIGH PRIEST AMENHOTEP:</strong> The gods demand greater offerings this year. The temple must expand.</p>
<p><strong>ROYAL TREASURER:</strong> The treasury is full, but the mines in Nubia report less gold.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH PRIEST AMENHOTEP:</strong> Then tax the farmers more. The Nile provides.</p>
<p><strong>ROYAL TREASURER:</strong> They say the flood was smaller last year.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH PRIEST AMENHOTEP:</strong> <em>(dismissive)</em> The flood always comes. It is divine law. They must simply work harder.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Same temple complex, administrative chambers. CHIEF SCRIBE KHAEMWASET reviews tax records with junior scribes.</em></p>
<p><strong>KHAEMWASET:</strong> Temple landholdings now comprise one-third of Egypt’s cultivated area.</p>
<p><strong>JUNIOR SCRIBE HORUS:</strong> Master, the farmers petition for relief. They say the temple takes too much of their harvest.</p>
<p><strong>KHAEMWASET:</strong> Too much? We serve the gods who ensure the flood comes at all. Without proper ceremonies, without adequate offerings, the Nile would cease to rise.</p>
<p><strong>JUNIOR SCRIBE HORUS:</strong> But Master, what if the farmers cannot afford both temple taxes and royal taxes?</p>
<p><strong>KHAEMWASET:</strong> Then they must become more efficient. Egyptian farmers have fed the world for two millennia. Surely they can manage to feed themselves and their gods.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Royal council chamber. VIZIER REKHMIRE addresses PHARAOH RAMESSES II.</em></p>
<p><strong>VIZIER REKHMIRE:</strong> Majesty, the provincial governors request permission to reduce temple tax quotas. The harvests have been poor for three years.</p>
<p><strong>RAMESSES II:</strong> Poor? The Nile floods as it has always flooded.</p>
<p><strong>VIZIER REKHMIRE:</strong> Yes, Majesty, but... less generously. And the population has grown. More mouths to feed from smaller harvests.</p>
<p><strong>RAMESSES II:</strong> Then perhaps the priests are correct—we have displeased the gods. Greater offerings are needed, not smaller ones.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Temple treasury. Massive stores of grain, gold, precious objects. TREASURY MASTER PTAHMOSE conducts inventory.</em></p>
<p><strong>PTAHMOSE:</strong> <em>(to assistant)</em> The temple now employs more scribes than the pharaoh’s own administration.</p>
<p><strong>ASSISTANT:</strong> Master, is that... appropriate? Some say temples exist to serve Egypt, not the reverse.</p>
<p><strong>PTAHMOSE:</strong> Who says this? Some impious farmer who begrudges the gods their due? Egypt exists because the gods will it. We serve the gods by serving the temples. This is the natural order.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Village meeting, same period. VILLAGE ELDER (descendant of the earlier one) speaks to worried farmers.</em></p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE ELDER:</strong> My grandfather’s grandfather taught that the flood always comes. But three years now, it has been weak.</p>
<p><strong>FARMER:</strong> The tax collectors take more grain each year. They say it is for the gods.</p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE ELDER:</strong> <em>(uncertain)</em> The gods... provide. They must. They always have.</p>
<p><strong>FARMER:</strong> But what if the gods require less ceremony and more practical help? What if they want us to store grain for lean years rather than burn it in offering fires?</p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE ELDER:</strong> <em>(shocked)</em> You speak blasphemy! The priests know the gods’ will!</p>
<p><strong>FARMER:</strong> The priests grow fat while we grow thin. How can this serve any god?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Theban temple complex, showing vast workshops, granaries, and residential quarters for priests.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The priesthood, custodians of the pharaoh’s divine authority, became a state within the state. They accumulated vast landholdings, controlled temple workshops, commanded armies of scribes and artisans.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: High-level priestly meeting. CHIEF PRIEST OF AMUN-RA, HERIHOR, addresses regional temple administrators.</em></p>
<p><strong>HERIHOR:</strong> The temple’s influence now rivals the pharaoh’s own. We control more land, command more workers, possess more wealth.</p>
<p><strong>REGIONAL PRIEST MENKHEPERRE:</strong> Some say we have grown too powerful, too separate from the people we serve.</p>
<p><strong>HERIHOR:</strong> We serve the gods, not the people. The people serve us so that we may serve the gods properly. This chain must not be broken.</p>
<p><strong>REGIONAL PRIEST MENKHEPERRE:</strong> But what if the people stop believing in the chain? What if they see only our wealth and their poverty?</p>
<p><strong>HERIHOR:</strong> Then we must demonstrate our necessity more clearly. Larger ceremonies, grander temples, more elaborate rituals. When they see our magnificent service to the gods, they will understand their own humble place.</p>
<p><em>Montage: Temple ceremonies becoming ever more elaborate and expensive, while scenes of rural poverty increase.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Their rituals grew more complex, their ceremonies more expensive, their concern for the actual welfare of Egypt’s people more abstract. They served the gods, they proclaimed—but increasingly, they served themselves.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Egyptian merchant quarter, circa 1000 BCE. MERCHANT NEBAMUN speaks with fellow traders.</em></p>
<p><strong>NEBAMUN:</strong> The Syrian traders offer iron weapons at half the price of our bronze.</p>
<p><strong>FELLOW MERCHANT:</strong> But surely Egyptian bronze is superior?</p>
<p><strong>NEBAMUN:</strong> I have tested both. The iron cuts bronze like papyrus. Yet our military refuses to consider it.</p>
<p><strong>FELLOW MERCHANT:</strong> Why?</p>
<p><strong>NEBAMUN:</strong> Because it is not Egyptian. Because we have always used bronze. Because change admits imperfection, and Egypt must be perfect.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Royal armory. MASTER OF ARMS AMENEMHAB shows weapons to visiting officials.</em></p>
<p><strong>AMENEMHAB:</strong> These bronze weapons have served Egypt’s armies for fifteen hundred years. They conquered Nubia, humbled the Hittites, extended our borders to the Euphrates.</p>
<p><strong>VISITING OFFICIAL:</strong> But what of reports about iron weapons? Some say they surpass bronze.</p>
<p><strong>AMENEMHAB:</strong> Some say many things. Egyptian bronze is blessed by Ptah himself, forged in sacred fires, consecrated by proper ceremonies. No barbarian metal can match divine workmanship.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Border fort. Egyptian garrison equipped with bronze weapons faces raiders with iron swords and spears.</em></p>
<p><strong>EGYPTIAN CAPTAIN:</strong> Stand firm! Egyptian bronze has never failed us!</p>
<p><em>The raiders’ iron weapons easily penetrate Egyptian bronze armor and cut through bronze spears.</em></p>
<p><strong>SURVIVING EGYPTIAN SOLDIER:</strong> <em>(to dying captain)</em> Perhaps... perhaps we should learn about iron.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN:</strong> <em>(with final breath)</em> Egypt... does not... learn from barbarians...</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The bureaucracy that managed this plenty grew ever more elaborate, ever more removed from the realities it was meant to serve. Innovation became unnecessary—dangerous, even, for it implied that Egyptian perfection could be improved.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Royal court, circa 800 BCE. PHARAOH TAHARQA sits on golden throne. His VIZIER reads reports.</em></p>
<p><strong>VIZIER:</strong> The Assyrians mass forces beyond our borders, Majesty. Their iron weapons cut through our bronze like papyrus.</p>
<p><strong>PHARAOH TAHARQA:</strong> Iron? A barbarous metal. Egyptian bronze has conquered the world for a thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>VIZIER:</strong> But sire, perhaps we should learn to forge iron ourselves—</p>
<p><strong>PHARAOH TAHARQA:</strong> <em>(angry)</em> Egypt does not learn from barbarians! We teach. They learn. This is the natural order.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Egyptian metallurgy workshop, same period. MASTER SMITH KHETY struggles with an iron sample.</em></p>
<p><strong>KHETY:</strong> <em>(to apprentice)</em> This metal resists our traditional methods. The fire must burn hotter, the timing must be different.</p>
<p><strong>APPRENTICE:</strong> Master, the Nubians to our south have begun working iron successfully. Perhaps we could send observers—</p>
<p><strong>KHETY:</strong> Observers? To learn from Nubians? Egypt taught metalworking to the world! If we cannot master this crude metal, then it is not worth mastering.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Border skirmish. Assyrian iron weapons easily destroy Egyptian bronze. The Egyptian army retreats in disarray.</em></p>
<p><strong>RETREATING EGYPTIAN GENERAL:</strong> <em>(to aide)</em> How can barbarian weapons defeat divine Egyptian bronze?</p>
<p><strong>AIDE:</strong> General, perhaps their weapons are not barbarian. Perhaps they are simply... better.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL:</strong> <em>(horrified)</em> Better than Egyptian? Impossible. There must be some trick, some deception.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Royal council meeting after the military defeat.</em></p>
<p><strong>PHARAOH TAHARQA:</strong> How do we respond to this Assyrian threat?</p>
<p><strong>MINISTER OF WAR:</strong> Majesty, we could mobilize more troops, perhaps recruit mercenaries—</p>
<p><strong>MINISTER OF FINANCE:</strong> We could commission larger temples, greater offerings to ensure divine favor—</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG SCRIBE KHAEMWASET:</strong> <em>(hesitant)</em> Majesty, perhaps we could study their iron-working techniques?</p>
<p><em>The entire council stares in shock.</em></p>
<p><strong>PHARAOH TAHARQA:</strong> Study? From Assyrians? Young scribe, Egypt is the teacher of nations, not their student.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG SCRIBE KHAEMWASET:</strong> But Majesty, if their methods produce superior weapons—</p>
<p><strong>HIGH PRIEST:</strong> Superior? To Egyptian methods blessed by the gods themselves? You speak heresy.</p>
<p><strong>PHARAOH TAHARQA:</strong> The scribe speaks ignorance. Egypt’s ways are eternal ways. If we face difficulties, it is because we have strayed from proper Egyptian traditions, not because we need to adopt foreign ones.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Same temple complex as before, now even more elaborate. CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK meets with other high officials.</em></p>
<p><strong>CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> The temple now owns one-third of Egypt’s farmland. We employ more scribes than the pharaoh himself.</p>
<p><strong>ROYAL OFFICIAL:</strong> The people grow restless. They say the priests live like kings while common folk starve.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> Let them complain. Without the temples, without the proper ceremonies, the Nile would not flood at all. We serve Egypt by serving the gods.</p>
<p><strong>ROYAL OFFICIAL:</strong> But what if the people stop believing?</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> <em>(serene)</em> The Nile will convince them. The Nile always floods. The gods provide.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Egyptian embassy to neighboring kingdoms, circa 700 BCE. AMBASSADOR MENTUHOTEP attempts to form alliances.</em></p>
<p><strong>PHOENICIAN KING:</strong> Egypt seeks our alliance against Assyria? Yet Egypt refuses to adopt the iron weapons that make such alliance useful.</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR MENTUHOTEP:</strong> Egyptian bronze, perfected over millennia, requires no improvement.</p>
<p><strong>PHOENICIAN KING:</strong> While Assyrian iron requires no argument—it simply cuts through your bronze.</p>
<p><strong>AMBASSADOR MENTUHOTEP:</strong> Egypt offers wisdom, tradition, the accumulated knowledge of ages—</p>
<p><strong>PHOENICIAN KING:</strong> Egypt offers the past. Assyria offers victory. Which would you choose?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Egyptian military academy, attempting to train officers.</em></p>
<p><strong>MILITARY INSTRUCTOR:</strong> The traditional Egyptian formation requires bronze spears in close ranks—</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG OFFICER:</strong> Instructor, but the Assyrians fight with longer iron weapons that outreach our bronze spears.</p>
<p><strong>MILITARY INSTRUCTOR:</strong> Then we must fight more bravely, with greater faith in Egyptian methods.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG OFFICER:</strong> But what if courage cannot overcome superior weapons?</p>
<p><strong>MILITARY INSTRUCTOR:</strong> Superior? No weapon is superior to one blessed by Egyptian gods and wielded by Egyptian hands. You must have faith in our traditions.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Battle scene where traditional Egyptian tactics fail catastrophically against iron-armed enemies.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The bureaucracy that managed this plenty grew ever more elaborate, ever more removed from the realities it was meant to serve. Innovation became not just unnecessary but dangerous—for it implied that Egyptian perfection could be improved upon.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Temple complex, now vast and sprawling. CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK meets with other high officials.</em></p>
<p><strong>CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> The temple now owns one-third of Egypt’s farmland. We employ more scribes than the pharaoh himself.</p>
<p><strong>ROYAL OFFICIAL:</strong> The people grow restless. They say the priests live like kings while common folk starve.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> Let them complain. Without the temples, without the proper ceremonies, the Nile would not flood at all. We serve Egypt by serving the gods.</p>
<p><strong>ROYAL OFFICIAL:</strong> But what if the people stop believing?</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> <em>(serene)</em> The Nile will convince them. The Nile always floods. The gods provide.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Same village as before, now impoverished. The latest VILLAGE ELDER speaks to a nearly empty gathering.</em></p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE ELDER:</strong> The flood comes later each year. The harvest grows smaller. The tax collectors take more.</p>
<p><strong>REMAINING FARMER:</strong> My son speaks of leaving. Going north to work for the Greeks.</p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE ELDER:</strong> <em>(desperately)</em> Egypt is eternal. The gods—</p>
<p><strong>REMAINING FARMER:</strong> What gods? The priests feast while we starve. Their ceremonies grow longer while our fields grow barren.</p>
<p><strong>VILLAGE ELDER:</strong> But without the ceremonies, without proper worship—</p>
<p><strong>REMAINING FARMER:</strong> Without food, we die. With food, we live. The gods seem less concerned with ceremony than the priests claim.</p>
<p><em>The farmer walks away. The village elder stands alone.</em></p>
<p><em>SCENE: Greek trading post in the Nile Delta, circa 600 BCE. GREEK MERCHANT HERODOTUS observes Egyptian society.</em></p>
<p><strong>HERODOTUS:</strong> <em>(to fellow Greek)</em> The Egyptians possess great monuments but little vitality. They remember their glorious past but seem unable to create a glorious present.</p>
<p><strong>FELLOW GREEK:</strong> Yet they still speak of teaching the world.</p>
<p><strong>HERODOTUS:</strong> They teach what they learned a thousand years ago. The world has moved beyond those lessons.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Persian invasion, 525 BCE. CAMBYSES II of Persia addresses his generals as they prepare to invade Egypt.</em></p>
<p><strong>CAMBYSES:</strong> The Egyptians rely on bronze weapons, outdated tactics, and the belief that their gods will protect them.</p>
<p><strong>PERSIAN GENERAL:</strong> Should we not fear their divine pharaoh? Their priests claim he commands the very Nile.</p>
<p><strong>CAMBYSES:</strong> If Egyptian pharaohs commanded the Nile, why do they struggle to feed their people? If their gods were so powerful, why do their enemies prosper?</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Persian forces easily conquering Egypt. Egyptian resistance crumbles quickly.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The priesthood, custodians of the pharaoh’s divine authority, became a state within the state. They accumulated vast landholdings, controlled temple workshops, commanded armies of scribes and artisans. But they could not command armies of soldiers capable of defending what they had accumulated.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: After Persian conquest. Persian administrator UDJAHORRESNET meets with Egyptian priests.</em></p>
<p><strong>UDJAHORRESNET:</strong> The Great King Cambyses offers to preserve Egyptian customs, maintain the temples, even support the traditional ceremonies.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> And in return?</p>
<p><strong>UDJAHORRESNET:</strong> Acknowledgment that Persia now rules Egypt. The pharaohs are gone. The gods apparently approve of new management.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> <em>(defeated)</em> The gods... the gods work in mysterious ways.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Persian court, showing Cambyses adopting some Egyptian royal regalia and titles.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Persians were pragmatic conquerors. Why destroy a system that had efficiently extracted wealth for three millennia? They simply placed themselves at its apex, leaving the rest largely unchanged.</p>
<p><em>Montage: Temple ceremonies continuing under Persian rule, but now serving Persian interests.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Their rituals grew more complex, their ceremonies more expensive, their concern for the actual welfare of Egypt’s people more abstract. Under pharaohs or Persian kings, the system served the system.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Macedonian military camp, 332 BCE. ALEXANDER THE GREAT studies maps with his generals.</em></p>
<p><strong>ALEXANDER:</strong> Egypt welcomes us as liberators. Their own people open the gates.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL PTOLEMY:</strong> After three thousand years of pharaohs? How is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>ALEXANDER:</strong> Egypt is no longer Egyptian. It belongs to its priests, its bureaucrats, its ceremonies. The people remember when Egypt served them. Now they serve Egypt’s institutions.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL PTOLEMY:</strong> So we simply replace Persian administrators with Macedonian ones?</p>
<p><strong>ALEXANDER:</strong> No. We build something new. Something that serves the living, not the dead.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Alexandria under construction. Greeks, Egyptians, Jews, and others working together.</em></p>
<p><strong>ALEXANDER:</strong> We will build a new city here. Not Egyptian, not Greek, but something new. A place where the best ideas compete rather than the most traditional ones.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Construction of the Great Library of Alexandria. DEMETRIUS OF PHALERUM oversees the project.</em></p>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS:</strong> This library will collect knowledge from all peoples—Egyptian, Greek, Persian, Indian, even barbarian wisdom if it proves useful.</p>
<p><strong>EGYPTIAN SCRIBE KHAEMWASET:</strong> But surely Egyptian wisdom should take precedence? We are the oldest civilization.</p>
<p><strong>DEMETRIUS:</strong> Age is not wisdom. Wisdom is wisdom, whatever its source. The library will judge ideas by their merit, not their ancestry.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Mixed council of Greeks and Egyptians under Ptolemy I.</em></p>
<p><strong>PTOLEMY I:</strong> Egypt’s new government will blend the best of all traditions—Greek innovation, Egyptian administration, Persian efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>EGYPTIAN OFFICIAL:</strong> What of traditional Egyptian ways? The customs of our ancestors?</p>
<p><strong>PTOLEMY I:</strong> Those that serve Egypt will be preserved. Those that served only themselves will not.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Last pharaoh’s court. CLEOPATRA VII speaks with her ADVISOR as Roman ships appear in the harbor.</em></p>
<p><strong>CLEOPATRA:</strong> Three hundred years my family has ruled Egypt. We are pharaohs.</p>
<p><strong>ADVISOR:</strong> But Majesty, are we Egyptian?</p>
<p><strong>CLEOPATRA:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> We are... what Egypt became.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Cleopatra’s final council meeting.</em></p>
<p><strong>CLEOPATRA:</strong> Rome offers Egypt a choice—submit as a province, or be conquered as a rebellion.</p>
<p><strong>ADVISOR:</strong> Majesty, perhaps we could negotiate better terms? Egypt still possesses great wealth, learned scholars, ancient wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>CLEOPATRA:</strong> Rome values none of these. They want Egypt’s grain, Egypt’s gold, Egypt’s strategic position. They care nothing for our pyramids or our priests.</p>
<p><strong>ADVISOR:</strong> But surely they respect our antiquity? Our cultural achievements?</p>
<p><strong>CLEOPATRA:</strong> They see them as curiosities. Monuments to dead gods, testimonies to vanished power. Rome is interested in living strength, not ancient glory.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The famous asp scene. Cleopatra’s death.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> By the time Alexander’s soldiers appeared on Egypt’s borders, the kingdom that had once made the earth tremble was little more than an elaborate facade. The pharaohs had grown weak, their armies mercenary, their treasury depleted by endless ceremonial expenditure.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman administration of Egypt under Augustus. Roman PREFECT CORNELIUS GALLUS addresses Egyptian officials.</em></p>
<p><strong>CORNELIUS GALLUS:</strong> Egypt will serve Rome as it served Persia and Macedonia—efficiently and profitably. Your temples may continue their ceremonies, your priests their rituals, your scribes their records.</p>
<p><strong>EGYPTIAN PRIEST:</strong> And Egyptian independence? Egyptian pride?</p>
<p><strong>CORNELIUS GALLUS:</strong> Rome has no quarrel with Egyptian pride, so long as it does not interfere with Roman authority.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Roman engineers redesigning Egyptian irrigation systems, improving efficiency.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Romans, like the Persians before them, were practical. They kept what worked and changed what didn’t. But now the changes came from outside, imposed by conquerors who owed nothing to Egyptian tradition.</p>
<p><em>Final montage: The pyramids remain, the temples endure, but Egyptian civilization is extinct. Camera shows modern tourists visiting ancient monuments.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> They did not fall to superior force—they fell to superior vitality. The Macedonians, then the Romans, wanted Egypt more than Egypt wanted to remain Egyptian.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern archaeological site. EGYPTOLOGIST carefully examines artifacts.</em></p>
<p><strong>EGYPTOLOGIST:</strong> <em>(to camera)</em> What’s remarkable is how completely Egyptian civilization simply... stopped. The language, the religion, the entire way of life—all abandoned within a few generations.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> But why? Egypt had survived for three thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>EGYPTOLOGIST:</strong> Because it stopped adapting. It stopped growing. Success became more important than the people who created that success. Egypt became a museum of itself.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> A museum?</p>
<p><strong>EGYPTOLOGIST:</strong> Beautiful, impressive, full of ancient treasures—but no longer alive. No longer creating. The past became more important than the present, tradition more valuable than innovation.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Sunrise over the Nile, exactly as in the opening shot.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> This was not conquest; it was inheritance. Alexander found a civilization that had already died from within, its corpse preserved by the institutions that had once given it life. The pyramids endured, the temples remained, but the spirit that built them had long since departed, suffocated by the very success it had created.</p>
<p><em>Final shot: Tourist photographing the Sphinx while local vendors sell “authentic” Egyptian souvenirs made in China.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Egypt became what all great civilizations risk becoming—a monument to their own former greatness, maintained by people who no longer remember why it was great in the first place.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-52" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Treadmill 2: Rome</h1>
<p>Civilisation.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherers, in clans, extended family, tribal and nomadic.</p>
<p>The invention of agriculture; man bending the world to his will, rather than adapting. </p>
<p>Settled in place, few things threaten. What <em>can?</em> We strive in concert, till our collective strength is geological in scale. With works of dam and road, on ever greater scale we master the wild and force it to submit.</p>
<p>And yet, without fail, we rise up! Only to fall again. And the night is long, as only those who dwell in it could truly tell.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>We know why civilisation rises; it’s obvious. A few good seasons, men band together and their strength multiplies. The only real threat is other men. But why is it inevitable that they fall again, they who are so mighty? </p>
<p>This week our focus shifts from Ancient Egypt to another titan among civilisations: Rome</p>
<h2 id="id-53">Episode 2: Rome - From Citizens to Subjects</h2>
<p><em>FADE IN: Dawn breaking over seven hills. Camera reveals the modest settlement of early Rome, wooden huts and small farms spread across the landscape.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Rome began with a simple proposition: that free men, fighting for their own hearths and fields, were worth ten slaves or mercenaries in battle. This was not philosophy but necessity—early Rome had no wealth to hire foreign warriors, no ancient authority to command obedience. They had only citizens who would fight because they were free, and who were free because they would fight.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman farmstead, 450 BCE. MARCUS CINCINATUS works his small plot with his son LUCIUS. A messenger arrives on horseback.</em></p>
<p><strong>MESSENGER:</strong> Marcus Cincinatus! The Senate commands your presence. The Aequi threaten Rome itself.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> <em>(setting down his plow)</em> Then Rome must be defended. Lucius, ready my armor.</p>
<p><strong>LUCIUS:</strong> But father, the harvest—</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Will wait. Some things matter more than grain.</p>
<p><strong>LUCIUS:</strong> Why must you go? Let others fight. You have served your terms.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Because “others” are neighbors, cousins, fellow Romans. If I will not defend them, why should they defend me?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Same farmstead, MARCUS strapping on well-worn but maintained armor.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> <em>(to LUCIUS)</em> This bronze was beaten from metal I mined myself, forged in our own fires. It protects Roman flesh defending Roman soil.</p>
<p><strong>LUCIUS:</strong> And if you fall?</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Then you will take this armor, tend this farm, serve in your turn. This is what it means to be Roman—not ruled by others, but ruling ourselves.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Roman military camp. Citizens of all ages and social classes don armor, form ranks.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> For five hundred years, this principle carried Roman eagles from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. Citizens served in the legions, citizens voted in the forum, citizens bore the burden and shared the glory of an empire that came to encompass the civilized world.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Military camp assembly. CONSUL VALERIUS MAXIMUS addresses newly arrived citizen-soldiers.</em></p>
<p><strong>CONSUL MAXIMUS:</strong> Citizens of Rome! You come from different tribes, different hills, but you serve the same cause.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG FARMER:</strong> Consul, why do we fight these Aequi? They have not attacked my farm.</p>
<p><strong>CONSUL MAXIMUS:</strong> Have they not? When they threaten Roman territory, they threaten the idea that free men can govern free men. Lose that, and your farm matters nothing—you will work it at another’s pleasure, not your own.</p>
<p><strong>OLDER VETERAN:</strong> The boy asks a fair question. In my father’s time, we fought to defend our walls. Now we march further and further from them.</p>
<p><strong>CONSUL MAXIMUS:</strong> Because the walls that matter are not stone but law. Roman law, Roman customs, Roman liberty. These we carry with us wherever we march.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Same military camp, evening. Veterans instruct new recruits in weapons use.</em></p>
<p><strong>VETERAN CENTURION TITUS:</strong> Roman tactics are simple—hold the line, trust your shield-brothers, advance together.</p>
<p><strong>NEW RECRUIT:</strong> What if I’m afraid?</p>
<p><strong>TITUS:</strong> Fear is wisdom. But courage is choosing right despite fear. You fight not just for yourself, but for the man beside you.</p>
<p><strong>NEW RECRUIT:</strong> And if he breaks?</p>
<p><strong>TITUS:</strong> Then you hold for both, until others can help. This is why we train together, eat together, share dangers together. Romans do not abandon Romans.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman legion on the march. CENTURION GAIUS MAXIMUS addresses his century—all citizen-soldiers.</em></p>
<p><strong>GAIUS MAXIMUS:</strong> You fight not for pay, but for Rome. Not for a king, but for your fellow citizens. The man beside you tends his vineyard when we’re not campaigning. The man behind you teaches his son to read. What we protect, we know. What we know, we fight for.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG SOLDIER:</strong> Centurion, the enemy outnumbers us three to one.</p>
<p><strong>GAIUS MAXIMUS:</strong> Then each Roman must be worth three of them. Are you a citizen or a slave?</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG SOLDIER:</strong> A citizen, sir!</p>
<p><strong>GAIUS MAXIMUS:</strong> Then act like one. Citizens choose their battles, slaves have battles chosen for them. We choose to stand here, on this ground, for these reasons. Fight like men who chose to be here.</p>
<p><em>Battle scene: Romans fight with disciplined ferocity. Their shields form an unbreakable wall.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The early Republic was built on citizen-soldiers who returned to their plows when the campaign season ended. They knew the stakes—these were their fields being defended, their families being protected, their future being secured.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: After battle, Romans caring for wounded. MARCUS helps both Roman and enemy wounded.</em></p>
<p><strong>AEQUI WARRIOR:</strong> <em>(to MARCUS)</em> Why do you help your enemy?</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> You fought bravely. Courage deserves respect.</p>
<p><strong>AEQUI WARRIOR:</strong> In our lands, enemies are slaves or corpses.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> In Rome, brave enemies can become Roman citizens. My grandfather was Sabine. My wife’s father was Etruscan. Now we are all Roman.</p>
<p><strong>AEQUI WARRIOR:</strong> <em>(surprised)</em> Citizens? Not slaves?</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Citizens. If you learn our ways, accept our laws, serve in our legions—you can become as Roman as I.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman military camp, discharge ceremony. CONSUL MAXIMUS addresses the citizen-soldiers.</em></p>
<p><strong>CONSUL MAXIMUS:</strong> Citizens! The campaign ends. Return to your farms, your workshops, your families. But remember—you are not just farmers who fought, but Romans who farmed. Carry that distinction with you.</p>
<p><strong>VETERAN SOLDIER:</strong> When do we serve again, Consul?</p>
<p><strong>CONSUL MAXIMUS:</strong> When Rome needs you. And Rome will need you—there are always enemies of free government, always those who prefer subjects to citizens.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Marcus returning to his farm. LUCIUS runs to greet him.</em></p>
<p><strong>LUCIUS:</strong> Father! You’re wounded!</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Scratches. The important thing is what we defended—your right to inherit this farm as a free Roman, not as another man’s property.</p>
<p><strong>LUCIUS:</strong> Did we truly win? The enemy seemed so fierce.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> We won because we fought for something worth defending. They fought because their chiefs commanded it. Free men choosing to fight will always defeat slaves forced to fight.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman forum, 350 BCE. Citizens of all classes debate policy. SENATOR APPIUS CLAUDIUS addresses the crowd.</em></p>
<p><strong>APPIUS CLAUDIUS:</strong> Citizens of Rome! The Gauls offer us tribute to spare their cities. What say you?</p>
<p><strong>FARMER-VETERAN:</strong> We fought to defend Rome, not to rob others. Let them keep their gold if they keep their peace.</p>
<p><strong>MERCHANT:</strong> But think of the trade opportunities! Peaceful Gaul means profitable Gaul.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG NOBLE:</strong> Why not make them allies instead? Romans need not always conquer. Sometimes we can convince.</p>
<p><strong>OLDER SENATOR:</strong> Alliance requires trust. Can we trust those who recently threatened our borders?</p>
<p><strong>GALLIC REPRESENTATIVE:</strong> <em>(stepping forward)</em> Noble Romans, we offer not just peace, but partnership. Gallic courage serving Roman law.</p>
<p><em>The debate continues. Citizens argue passionately but respectfully.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Roman forum was more than a marketplace—it was where free men learned to govern free men through argument rather than force, through persuasion rather than command.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Roman legion was not merely a military formation; it was a community in arms, bound by oaths of loyalty not just to commanders but to each other. When such men fought, they fought with the desperate courage of those who had everything to lose.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: After battle, Romans tending their wounded. MARCUS (now older) helps a Germanic prisoner.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Why do you help your enemy?</p>
<p><strong>GERMANIC WARRIOR:</strong> You fought bravely. Courage deserves respect.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> In Rome, brave enemies can become Roman citizens.</p>
<p><strong>GERMANIC WARRIOR:</strong> <em>(surprised)</em> Citizens? Not slaves?</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS:</strong> Citizens. My grandfather was Sabine. My wife’s father was Etruscan. Now we are all Roman.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman citizenship ceremony, five years later. The same GERMANIC WARRIOR, now romanized as GERMANICUS, takes the oath with other new citizens.</em></p>
<p><strong>MAGISTRATE:</strong> Do you swear to defend Roman law?</p>
<p><strong>GERMANICUS:</strong> I swear.</p>
<p><strong>MAGISTRATE:</strong> Do you swear to serve Rome before tribe, family, or personal interest?</p>
<p><strong>GERMANICUS:</strong> I swear.</p>
<p><strong>MAGISTRATE:</strong> Then by law and custom, you are Roman. Your children will be Roman. Your loyalty has earned you what birth gave others.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Military camp, ten years later. GERMANICUS, now a centurion, trains new recruits including both born Romans and foreign volunteers.</em></p>
<p><strong>GERMANICUS:</strong> <em>(to recruits)</em> I was your enemy before I was your brother. Rome made me Roman not by conquest but by choice. Now I fight for Rome as fiercely as any man born within her walls.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG GALLIC RECRUIT:</strong> How do we know the Romans truly accept us?</p>
<p><strong>GERMANICUS:</strong> Because they trust you with their lives. Roman citizenship is not a gift—it is a contract. You serve Rome faithfully, Rome treats you as Roman. No questions, no exceptions.</p>
<p><em>Montage: Expansion of Roman territory, but also expansion of Roman citizenship. Defeated enemies become allies, allies become citizens.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Their expansion was not mere conquest but incorporation. Defeated enemies became allies, allies became citizens. The genius of Rome lay not in ruling subject peoples but in making them Roman.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman engineering project—road construction across Gaul. ROMAN ENGINEER LUCIUS VITRUVIUS oversees mixed crews of Romans, Gauls, and Germans.</em></p>
<p><strong>VITRUVIUS:</strong> This road will carry Roman legions, but also Gallic goods, Germanic crafters, ideas from all our provinces.</p>
<p><strong>GALLIC FOREMAN:</strong> My people said Romans come to steal and destroy.</p>
<p><strong>VITRUVIUS:</strong> Some do. But the best of us come to build. Roads, laws, cities, citizenship—these things outlast any single conquest.</p>
<p><strong>GERMANIC WORKER:</strong> In my homeland, we build for our tribe alone. Here we build for... everyone?</p>
<p><strong>VITRUVIUS:</strong> Everyone Roman. Which, if you choose, includes you. Rome grows stronger with each people who join us, not weaker.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman villa, 200 BCE. LUCIUS CINCINATUS (now middle-aged) dines with guests from across the Mediterranean—Greeks, Gauls, Spaniards, all now Roman citizens.</em></p>
<p><strong>GREEK SCHOLAR:</strong> In Athens, we invented philosophy. In Rome, you’ve perfected it—the philosophy of practical governance.</p>
<p><strong>GALLIC OFFICER:</strong> I command Romans who were once my enemies. Now they would die for me, as I would for them.</p>
<p><strong>SPANISH MERCHANT:</strong> Roman roads carry my goods from Cadiz to Antioch. Roman law protects my contracts in every province.</p>
<p><strong>GERMAN CRAFTSMAN:</strong> Roman workshops employ my skills, Roman customers buy my wares. I prosper as I never could in my homeland.</p>
<p><strong>LUCIUS:</strong> <em>(raising his cup)</em> To Rome—not a place, but an idea. The idea that free men can govern themselves, and that any man can become free.</p>
<p><em>All toast. Camera lingers on their faces—different peoples, united purpose.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Greek learning, Gallic courage, Germanic discipline, Spanish commerce—all were absorbed into a civilization that grew stronger with every addition. Rome’s roads carried not just legions but ideas, trade, and the promise that even a shepherd in Gaul might one day see his son rise to the consulship.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Same Roman forum, now 100 BCE. The crowd is different—more urban, less martial. TRIBUNE GAIUS GRACCHUS addresses them.</em></p>
<p><strong>GAIUS GRACCHUS:</strong> Citizens! The small farmers who built Rome are driven from their land by slaves and imported grain. What use is empire if Romans become beggars?</p>
<p><strong>WEALTHY SENATOR:</strong> The grain dole feeds the people. Is this not generous?</p>
<p><strong>GAIUS GRACCHUS:</strong> Generous? To make citizens dependent on gifts? Our fathers fought for their bread. Now their sons beg for it.</p>
<p><strong>URBAN CITIZEN:</strong> But fighting is hard work! Why should we labor in fields when slaves can work for us?</p>
<p><strong>GAIUS GRACCHUS:</strong> Because work makes citizens, idleness makes subjects. A man who cannot feed himself cannot govern himself.</p>
<p><strong>CROWD:</strong> <em>(chanting)</em> Bread and circuses! Bread and circuses!</p>
<p><strong>GAIUS GRACCHUS:</strong> <em>(defeated)</em> What have we become?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman villa estate, same period. Massive slave-worked plantation. WEALTHY SENATOR CRASSUS walks among the fields with his ESTATE MANAGER.</em></p>
<p><strong>CRASSUS:</strong> How much do we save using slave labor versus hiring citizen farmers?</p>
<p><strong>ESTATE MANAGER:</strong> Perhaps seventy percent, Senator. Slaves require only food and shelter. Citizens demand wages, treatment as equals.</p>
<p><strong>CRASSUS:</strong> And the market?</p>
<p><strong>ESTATE MANAGER:</strong> We undersell grain from citizen farms by half. They cannot compete.</p>
<p><strong>CRASSUS:</strong> Then soon there will be no citizen farms. Only estates like ours.</p>
<p><strong>ESTATE MANAGER:</strong> Senator, is this... wise? Our ancestors built Rome on citizen farmers.</p>
<p><strong>CRASSUS:</strong> Our ancestors were poor. We are rich. Rich enough to hire other men to do our fighting, our farming, our thinking. Is this not progress?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Displaced farmer’s family arriving in Rome. MARCUS FLAVIUS (descendant of earlier farmers) carries his few possessions.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARCUS FLAVIUS:</strong> <em>(to his son)</em> Our farm could not compete with slave labor. Now we must seek work in the city.</p>
<p><strong>SON:</strong> What work, father? You know only farming.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS FLAVIUS:</strong> Whatever work there is. Construction, perhaps, or the docks.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same family, months later, living in a tenement. MARCUS looks worn, defeated.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARCUS FLAVIUS:</strong> <em>(to neighbor)</em> I served Rome in three campaigns. Now Rome feeds me like a stray dog.</p>
<p><strong>NEIGHBOR:</strong> But we eat, don’t we? The grain dole never fails.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS FLAVIUS:</strong> Eating is not living. My grandfather fed himself by his own labor. I eat by another man’s charity.</p>
<p><strong>NEIGHBOR:</strong> Your grandfather was a fool to work so hard when he could have lived more easily.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Gladiatorial arena. Massive crowd cheers as gladiators fight. Camera focuses on the spectators—soft, complacent, entertained.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> But success bred transformation, and transformation bred weakness. The small farms that had produced citizen-soldiers gave way to vast slave-worked estates. The farmers themselves, impoverished by endless military service, drifted to Rome to live on grain doles and gladiatorial spectacles.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Arena spectator area. FORMER CITIZEN-SOLDIERS now cheer gladiatorial combat.</em></p>
<p><strong>SPECTATOR 1:</strong> That Thracian fights like a Roman!</p>
<p><strong>SPECTATOR 2:</strong> Better than a Roman. When did you last see citizens fight so bravely?</p>
<p><strong>SPECTATOR 1:</strong> Citizens don’t need to fight. We hire Germans and Gauls for that.</p>
<p><strong>SPECTATOR 2:</strong> And they fight for pay, not for Rome.</p>
<p><strong>SPECTATOR 1:</strong> <em>(shrugging)</em> Pay is more reliable than patriotism.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman Senate house, 80 BCE. Senators debate military recruitment.</em></p>
<p><strong>SENATOR CATO:</strong> The legions report difficulty recruiting citizen-soldiers. Young Romans prefer the grain dole to military service.</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR POMPEY:</strong> Then we recruit from the provinces. Germans fight well, Gauls show courage, Spaniards have discipline.</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR CATO:</strong> But they fight for pay, not for Rome. What happens when Rome cannot pay them?</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR POMPEY:</strong> Then we will pay them more. Rome is rich enough.</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR CATO:</strong> Rome was built by men who would fight for nothing more than the right to remain Roman. Now we must pay men to pretend to be Roman.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Military recruitment center. ROMAN RECRUITER struggles to enlist citizens while foreign volunteers queue eagerly.</em></p>
<p><strong>RECRUITER:</strong> <em>(to young Roman)</em> The legions offer good pay, regular meals, training in valuable skills.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG ROMAN:</strong> But why should I risk my life when slaves can work my land and the state feeds my family?</p>
<p><strong>RECRUITER:</strong> For the honor of serving Rome.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG ROMAN:</strong> Honor doesn’t fill my belly or warm my bed.</p>
<p><em>The young Roman walks away. The recruiter turns to eager Germanic volunteers.</em></p>
<p><strong>RECRUITER:</strong> <em>(to Germans)</em> You understand the terms? Service to Rome, loyalty to Rome, fight for Rome?</p>
<p><strong>GERMANIC VOLUNTEER:</strong> We understand pay. We understand food. We understand victory. This is enough.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Military camp, 50 BCE. GENERAL JULIUS CAESAR addresses his troops—now mostly Germanic and Gallic mercenaries.</em></p>
<p><strong>CAESAR:</strong> Men of the Tenth Legion! We march on Rome itself!</p>
<p><strong>GERMANIC CAPTAIN:</strong> We fight for Caesar, not for Rome.</p>
<p><strong>CAESAR:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> Then for Caesar it shall be.</p>
<p><em>No discussion of Roman law or citizen duty. Just orders and obedience.</em></p>
<p><strong>GALLIC SOLDIER:</strong> Will we be paid extra for fighting Romans?</p>
<p><strong>CAESAR:</strong> You will be paid very well. Roman gold spends better than German courage or Gallic pride.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Citizens of Rome hearing of Caesar’s approach. Panic in the streets.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROMAN CITIZEN 1:</strong> Caesar’s legions march on Rome! We must defend the city!</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN CITIZEN 2:</strong> With what? Who among us remembers how to fight?</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN CITIZEN 1:</strong> Surely there are citizen militia, trained bands—</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN CITIZEN 2:</strong> There are arena spectators and grain recipients. The citizens who could fight are either dead or bought.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The legions, once filled with citizens fighting for their homeland, came to depend on Germanic and Gallic mercenaries fighting for pay. The virtues that built Rome—discipline, service, sacrifice for the common good—withered in the luxury that Roman conquest had made possible.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Senate house, 44 BCE. BRUTUS and other senators discuss the assassination of Caesar.</em></p>
<p><strong>BRUTUS:</strong> We killed Caesar to save the Republic.</p>
<p><strong>CASSIUS:</strong> But look around you. Where are the citizen-soldiers? Where are the farmer-senators? The Republic died long before Caesar.</p>
<p><strong>BRUTUS:</strong> Then what have we done?</p>
<p><strong>CASSIUS:</strong> Killed a tyrant to make room for another tyrant. The question is not whether Rome will have emperors, but which emperor.</p>
<p><strong>CICERO:</strong> Surely we can restore the old ways? Revive the citizen assemblies, return power to the people?</p>
<p><strong>CASSIUS:</strong> What people? The citizens live on grain doles and demand entertainment. They do not want power—they want comfort.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman forum after Caesar’s assassination. Citizens respond to news of his death.</em></p>
<p><strong>HERALD:</strong> Citizens of Rome! Caesar is dead! The Republic is restored!</p>
<p><strong>CROWD:</strong> <em>(confused murmur)</em> What does this mean for the grain dole?</p>
<p><strong>CITIZEN 1:</strong> Will the games continue?</p>
<p><strong>CITIZEN 2:</strong> Who will pay the legions?</p>
<p><strong>HERALD:</strong> You are free citizens again! You may govern yourselves!</p>
<p><strong>CITIZEN 3:</strong> Govern ourselves? I don’t know how to govern. I know how to collect my grain ration.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: OCTAVIAN (future Augustus) addressing troops. The transition from Republic to Empire is complete.</em></p>
<p><strong>OCTAVIAN:</strong> I am your Emperor, and you are my subjects. The charade of the Republic is ended.</p>
<p><strong>PRAETORIAN CAPTAIN:</strong> What of the Senate?</p>
<p><strong>OCTAVIAN:</strong> They may keep their ceremonies. I will keep the power.</p>
<p><strong>PRAETORIAN CAPTAIN:</strong> And the citizen assemblies?</p>
<p><strong>OCTAVIAN:</strong> Citizens who cannot govern their own households cannot govern the state. I will govern for them.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Imperial bureaucracy taking shape. AUGUSTUS (formerly Octavian) meets with his administrators.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUGUSTUS:</strong> The provinces must be administered efficiently. Each must contribute its proper share to the imperial treasury.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR:</strong> Majesty, shall we restore the old system of citizen governors serving annual terms?</p>
<p><strong>AUGUSTUS:</strong> Annual terms breed chaos. Permanent administrators breed expertise. Appoint professional bureaucrats who serve imperial interests, not local politics.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR:</strong> But the tradition of citizen service—</p>
<p><strong>AUGUSTUS:</strong> Tradition is luxury. Efficiency is necessity. Rome needs administration more than it needs participation.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Provincial administration meeting. Imperial bureaucrats plan tax collection.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR:</strong> The tax farmers squeeze the provinces too hard. There are rebellions brewing.</p>
<p><strong>IMPERIAL TREASURER:</strong> Then we squeeze harder. Rebellion is expensive—prevention is cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR:</strong> But these are Roman citizens in the provinces. Do they not deserve consideration?</p>
<p><strong>IMPERIAL TREASURER:</strong> They deserve efficient government. Whether they participate in it is irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Republic gave way to Empire, and Empire gave way to bureaucracy. Caesars replaced consuls, subjects replaced citizens. The forums where free men had once debated the fate of nations became stages for imperial ceremony.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Imperial court, 150 CE. EMPEROR MARCUS AURELIUS, the philosopher-emperor, struggles with the contradictions of rule.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARCUS AURELIUS:</strong> <em>(to his advisors)</em> I write of duty, honor, service to the common good. Yet I rule through force, not consent.</p>
<p><strong>IMPERIAL ADVISOR:</strong> Majesty, the people are happier under imperial rule than they ever were governing themselves.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS AURELIUS:</strong> Happier? Or merely more comfortable? A well-fed slave may be happier than a struggling farmer, but which life has more virtue?</p>
<p><strong>IMPERIAL ADVISOR:</strong> Virtue is luxury, Majesty. Order is necessity.</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS AURELIUS:</strong> <em>(sadly)</em> And thus dies every republic—not in revolution, but in comfort.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Imperial court, 250 CE. EMPEROR DIOCLETIAN issues edicts to bureaucrats who have never seen a battlefield.</em></p>
<p><strong>DIOCLETIAN:</strong> The provinces must provide more soldiers, more taxes, more grain. The empire grows expensive to maintain.</p>
<p><strong>BUREAUCRAT:</strong> Majesty, the provincial governors report unrest. The people say the taxes are too heavy.</p>
<p><strong>DIOCLETIAN:</strong> Then increase the punishments. Fear is more efficient than consent.</p>
<p><strong>BUREAUCRAT:</strong> But sire, these are Roman citizens—</p>
<p><strong>DIOCLETIAN:</strong> <em>(angry)</em> There are no citizens! There are subjects, and there are enemies. Treat them accordingly.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Same bureaucrat, later, speaking with colleagues.</em></p>
<p><strong>BUREAUCRAT 1:</strong> Do you remember when Romans debated policy in the forum?</p>
<p><strong>BUREAUCRAT 2:</strong> Policy is debated in the imperial council now. More efficiently, with better information.</p>
<p><strong>BUREAUCRAT 1:</strong> But the people have no voice.</p>
<p><strong>BUREAUCRAT 2:</strong> The people have food, entertainment, protection from war. What more do they need?</p>
<p><strong>BUREAUCRAT 1:</strong> Perhaps... the right to choose?</p>
<p><strong>BUREAUCRAT 2:</strong> Choice requires competence. Few people are competent to choose wisely. Better that wise men choose for them.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Provincial villa, same period. A ROMAN FAMILY barricades their doors as Gothic raiders approach.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROMAN FATHER:</strong> Where are the legions? Where is Rome’s protection?</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN MOTHER:</strong> The legions fight each other for the purple. There is no Rome anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN SON:</strong> Father, should we not fight? Are we not Romans?</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN FATHER:</strong> Romans fight. We are merely... inhabitants of Roman provinces.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The very wealth that flowed from conquered provinces poisoned the wellspring of Roman strength. Why serve when you could be served? Why sacrifice when others would sacrifice for you? Why fight when mercenaries would fight in your place?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Walls of Rome, 410 CE. ALARIC and his Visigoth army stand before the gates. A ROMAN OFFICIAL negotiates.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROMAN OFFICIAL:</strong> Rome offers you gold, land, titles. What more could you want?</p>
<p><strong>ALARIC:</strong> I want nothing from Rome. Rome has nothing to give.</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN OFFICIAL:</strong> We are eternal! We are the inheritors of Caesar, of Augustus—</p>
<p><strong>ALARIC:</strong> You are the inheritors of men who conquered the world. What have you conquered?</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN OFFICIAL:</strong> We maintain civilization! Roman law, Roman order, Roman peace—</p>
<p><strong>ALARIC:</strong> Roman law written by bureaucrats, Roman order enforced by foreign mercenaries, Roman peace purchased with tribute. This is not inheritance—this is pretense.</p>
<p><em>The gates open. Romans open their own city to the Visigoths.</em></p>
<p><strong>ALARIC:</strong> <em>(to his warriors)</em> Enter the city that once conquered Germania. See how conquerors become conquered.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Inside Rome during the sack. VISIGOTH WARRIOR speaks with cowering ROMAN SENATOR.</em></p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH WARRIOR:</strong> Where are the legions that conquered my grandfather?</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN SENATOR:</strong> Fighting in Gaul, in Britain, in Africa—</p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH WARRIOR:</strong> Fighting each other for the throne. Not one defends Rome itself.</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN SENATOR:</strong> We pay others to fight for us. It is more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH WARRIOR:</strong> Efficient? You cannot defend your own capital. My grandfather feared Roman citizens. I pity Roman subjects.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman villa during the sack. Wealthy Roman family hides while Visigoths loot their possessions.</em></p>
<p><strong>ROMAN PATRIARCH:</strong> <em>(to his son)</em> Our ancestors built this wealth with their own hands, defended it with their own courage.</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN SON:</strong> What good did that do them? They’re still dead.</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN PATRIARCH:</strong> But they died as Romans. We live as... what are we now?</p>
<p><strong>ROMAN SON:</strong> Practical. Realistic. Why die for honor when you can live for comfort?</p>
<p><em>Visigoths break down the door. The family offers them gold to spare their lives.</em></p>
<p><em>SCENE: Forum Romanum, empty except for scavenging birds. VISIGOTH CHIEFTAIN walks among the abandoned statues.</em></p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH CHIEFTAIN:</strong> <em>(to lieutenant)</em> These statues—who were these men?</p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH LIEUTENANT:</strong> Romans who built this empire, conquered our lands, ruled the world.</p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH CHIEFTAIN:</strong> And their descendants?</p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH LIEUTENANT:</strong> Hide in their villas, offering us gold to spare them.</p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH CHIEFTAIN:</strong> <em>(touching statue of Augustus)</em> Empire passes from those who built it to those who inherited it to those who can take it. This is the way of the world.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> By the time Alaric’s Visigoths appeared at Rome’s gates, they found a city that had already forgotten how to defend itself. The eternal city fell not to superior strength but to superior vitality—the barbarians wanted Rome more than Romans did.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Inside fallen Rome. HISTORIAN PROCOPIUS walks through abandoned buildings, dictating to his scribe.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROCOPIUS:</strong> What we witness is not conquest but inheritance. Rome did not fall to Visigothic strength but to its own weakness—the weakness that comes when a civilization becomes more concerned with consuming wealth than with creating the virtues that made wealth possible.</p>
<p><strong>SCRIBE:</strong> Master, surely Rome’s fall was inevitable? All empires end.</p>
<p><strong>PROCOPIUS:</strong> Inevitable? Rome could have ended differently—through transformation rather than collapse, through choice rather than conquest. But that would have required Romans to remain Roman.</p>
<p><strong>SCRIBE:</strong> What does it mean to remain Roman?</p>
<p><strong>PROCOPIUS:</strong> To value citizenship over comfort, duty over pleasure, the common good over private gain. When Romans stopped being Roman, Rome stopped being Rome.</p>
<p><em>Camera pulls back to reveal the empty forum, the broken statues, the silent temples.</em></p>
<p><em>SCENE: Visigoth council in the captured city. ALARIC addresses his chiefs.</em></p>
<p><strong>ALARIC:</strong> We hold Rome, but what have we truly won?</p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH CHIEF 1:</strong> The greatest city in the world!</p>
<p><strong>ALARIC:</strong> A city whose people could not defend it, whose soldiers fight for pay rather than principle, whose leaders hide while their capital falls.</p>
<p><strong>VISIGOTH CHIEF 2:</strong> Then why did we come here?</p>
<p><strong>ALARIC:</strong> Because something in us remembered when Rome was great. When Romans were citizens, not subjects. When this city meant something worth conquering.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Years later. ALARIC, now older, speaks with a young Visigoth warrior born in Rome.</em></p>
<p><strong>YOUNG VISIGOTH:</strong> My lord, the Roman senators petition for restoration of their privileges.</p>
<p><strong>ALARIC:</strong> What privileges?</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG VISIGOTH:</strong> To collect grain doles, to attend gladiatorial games, to be entertained and fed without working.</p>
<p><strong>ALARIC:</strong> <em>(disgusted)</em> Grant their petition. Let them remain what they became—consumers, not creators. We will be what they forgot to be.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The eternal city fell not to Visigothic strength but to its own weakness—the weakness that comes when a civilization becomes more concerned with consuming wealth than with creating the virtues that made wealth possible in the first place.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Final scene showing the contrast. Visigoth children learning to farm and fight while Roman children wait for grain rations.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Rome’s fall was not a tragedy but a transfer—from a people who had forgotten how to earn greatness to a people still learning to deserve it.</p>
<p><em>Final shot: Modern Rome, bustling with tourists photographing ancient ruins.</em></p>
<p><strong>MODERN TOUR GUIDE:</strong> <em>(to tourists)</em> The Colosseum could hold fifty thousand spectators. They came here to be entertained while their empire crumbled around them.</p>
<p><strong>TOURIST:</strong> Why didn’t they fight back?</p>
<p><strong>TOUR GUIDE:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> Perhaps they had forgotten how. Perhaps they had forgotten why.</p>
<p><strong>TOURIST:</strong> What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>TOUR GUIDE:</strong> When people stop believing their civilization is worth defending, it stops being worth defending. Rome fell when Romans stopped wanting to be Roman.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-54" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Treadmill 3: China</h1>
<p>Civilisation.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherers, in clans, extended family, tribal and nomadic.</p>
<p>The invention of agriculture; man bending the world to his will, rather than adapting. </p>
<p>Settled in place, few things threaten. What <em>can?</em> We strive in concert, till our collective strength is geological in scale. With works of dam and road, on ever greater scale we master the wild and force it to submit.</p>
<p>And yet, without fail, we rise up! Only to fall again. And the night is long, as only those who dwell in it could truly tell.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>We know why civilisation rises; it’s obvious. A few good seasons, men band together and their strength multiplies. The only real threat is other men. But why is it inevitable that they fall again, they who are so mighty?</p>
<p>Egypt and Rome have fallen in their turn. Yet nothing is completely forgotten, and empires rise from the ruins with ever increasing speed. This week, we look at a civilisation that rivalled Egypt in durability, with far higher technology. For this, we gaze into the East.</p>
<h2 id="id-55">Episode 3: The Ming - Turning from the Sea</h2>
<p><em>FADE IN: Vast harbor at Nanjing, 1405. Hundreds of ships of incredible size fill the water. The camera moves through the fleet, revealing ships that dwarf everything around them.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Never in human history had any power commanded such maritime supremacy as Ming China in the early fifteenth century. These were not merely ships but floating manifestations of imperial will—demonstrations that the Middle Kingdom feared no distance, no ocean, no foreign power.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Imperial court, Forbidden City, 1402. EMPEROR YONGLE plans the great expeditions with his advisors.</em></p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR YONGLE:</strong> The usurper’s supporters fled across the sea. We must show the world that no ocean can hide from the Dragon Emperor’s reach.</p>
<p><strong>CONFUCIAN ADVISOR:</strong> Majesty, the ancient sages taught that good government begins at home. Should we not perfect the realm before venturing abroad?</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR YONGLE:</strong> The realm is perfect. Now the world must see that perfection. <em>(to ZHENG HE)</em> Admiral, can China build a fleet to cross any ocean?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Give me the resources, Majesty, and China will rule the seas as it rules the land.</p>
<p><strong>COURT TREASURER:</strong> <em>(hesitant)</em> The cost, Majesty—such fleets will be expensive beyond measure.</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR YONGLE:</strong> Expensive? China’s treasury overflows. Better to spend it showing the world China’s might than hoarding it like merchants.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Aboard the flagship. ADMIRAL ZHENG HE, a Muslim Chinese commander, studies nautical charts with his officers.</em></p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Seven voyages we have planned. From here to the Western Ocean, to the very edge of the world itself.</p>
<p><strong>NAVIGATOR WAN:</strong> Admiral, the ships are ready. Two hundred and fifty vessels, twenty-eight thousand men. The largest fleet in human history.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Not just the largest—the most advanced. While barbarians hug their coastlines in fear, we will rule the open ocean.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN WANG:</strong> Admiral, some at court question the expense. They say we could build a hundred temples with the cost of one voyage.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Temples serve the dead. These fleets serve the living Emperor and his living glory. Let the court officials count coins—we count kingdoms.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Private meeting between Zheng He and trusted captains.</em></p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> You know why the Emperor truly sends us beyond the seas?</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN LI:</strong> To find the usurper Emperor Jianwen?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Partly. But also to prove that his rule extends beyond the Middle Kingdom. Every barbarian king who acknowledges China’s supremacy validates his throne.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN WANG:</strong> And if we find no barbarian kings worth impressing?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Then we will make them worth impressing. Chinese power shapes the world, gentlemen. We are its instruments.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Interior of a treasure ship. Vast holds filled with porcelain, silk, spices, and diplomatic gifts.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Admiral Zheng He’s treasure fleets dwarfed anything European shipyards would produce for another century. The largest ships stretched over sixty metres in length, crewed by twenty-eight thousand sailors across entire fleets, carrying armies and ambassadors to the ends of the known world.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Dock construction. Chinese shipwrights using advanced techniques—watertight compartments, sophisticated rudder systems, multiple masts.</em></p>
<p><strong>MASTER SHIPWRIGHT:</strong> Each treasure ship is a floating palace. Watertight compartments so if one floods, the ship survives. Rudders that respond to the smallest touch. Sails that catch wind from any direction.</p>
<p><strong>APPRENTICE:</strong> Master, why do we build them so large?</p>
<p><strong>MASTER SHIPWRIGHT:</strong> Because we can. Because China is mighty, and our ships must show the world that might.</p>
<p><em>Montage: The fleet departing. Thousands line the shores to watch the treasure ships leave port.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Seven great expeditions reached India, Arabia, the coast of Africa. Chinese admirals collected tribute from kingdoms that had never heard of Europe, established trading posts along sea routes that Columbus would not discover for another sixty years.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Foreign port—Ceylon (Sri Lanka). Local KING receives Chinese delegation. The treasure fleet dominates the harbor.</em></p>
<p><strong>CEYLONESE KING:</strong> Never have we seen ships such as these. Are you gods come from the sea?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> We are servants of the Dragon Emperor, the Son of Heaven. China honors your kingdom with this visit.</p>
<p><strong>CEYLONESE KING:</strong> What do you require of us?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Acknowledgment that the Middle Kingdom is supreme among all nations. In return, China offers protection, trade, wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>CEYLONESE MINISTER:</strong> <em>(quietly to king)</em> Your Majesty, we have grown prosperous through independence. Why should we acknowledge foreign supremacy?</p>
<p><strong>CEYLONESE KING:</strong> <em>(looking at the massive fleet)</em> Because independence is meaningless if we cannot defend it.</p>
<p><em>The local king looks at the massive fleet and nods submissively.</em></p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> <em>(to his officers, quietly)</em> Mark this well—power commands respect, but it does not create loyalty. This king submits from fear, not conviction.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN WANG:</strong> Admiral, does that matter? If barbarians obey, why should we care about their feelings?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> <em>(thoughtful)</em> Perhaps it doesn’t matter. But I wonder what happens when the power that compels obedience... disappears.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> These were not mere trading voyages but demonstrations of imperial might on a scale that beggared imagination. But demonstrations to whom? And for what purpose?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Treasure ship’s interior. Chinese scholars catalog exotic goods—spices, gems, even a live giraffe.</em></p>
<p><strong>CHIEF SCHOLAR:</strong> The barbarian lands produce marvels, Admiral. This spotted beast from Africa, these spices from India—surely worth study?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Curiosities. Nothing China cannot improve upon. We sail to show them what civilization looks like, not to learn from them.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF SCHOLAR:</strong> But surely some of their innovations could benefit the Middle Kingdom? Their metalworking techniques, their agricultural methods—</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> <em>(firm)</em> China is the source, not the student. The Middle Kingdom teaches; others learn. Remember your place, Scholar.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG SCHOLAR:</strong> <em>(quietly to Chief Scholar)</em> Master, what if the barbarians know things we do not?</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF SCHOLAR:</strong> <em>(sharply)</em> Then they are not worth knowing. Chinese knowledge is complete knowledge.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: African coast. Chinese trading post being established. Local AFRICAN CHIEFTAIN negotiates with Chinese officials.</em></p>
<p><strong>AFRICAN CHIEFTAIN:</strong> Your great ships bring wonders, but we have wonders too. Our metalworking, our navigation of the land routes, our understanding of local currents—</p>
<p><strong>CHINESE OFFICIAL:</strong> Your local skills are... interesting. But see what China has brought you. Silk finer than any fabric you have known, porcelain more beautiful than any clay vessel.</p>
<p><strong>AFRICAN CHIEFTAIN:</strong> Perhaps we could trade knowledge as well as goods? Your ship-building techniques for our metal-working secrets?</p>
<p><strong>CHINESE OFFICIAL:</strong> <em>(dismissive)</em> China does not trade techniques. China grants its wisdom to the deserving. Your role is to provide tribute, not instruction.</p>
<p><em>The African chieftain’s face shows frustration, but he nods.</em></p>
<p><strong>AFRICAN MINISTER:</strong> <em>(later, to the chieftain)</em> They take our gold and ivory but scorn our knowledge. How long will such arrangements endure?</p>
<p><strong>AFRICAN CHIEFTAIN:</strong> As long as their ships rule our waters. But ships can sail away...</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The treasure ships themselves were floating cities, accompanied by hundreds of support vessels carrying troops, horses, supplies, and diplomatic gifts. When Zheng He’s fleet anchored in a foreign port, it was as if a new city had materialised from the ocean itself.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Imperial court, Forbidden City, 1420. EMPEROR YONGLE receives reports from Zheng He’s expeditions.</em></p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR YONGLE:</strong> The barbarian kingdoms submit to Chinese authority?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> All acknowledge the Dragon Emperor’s supremacy, Majesty. Tribute flows to Beijing from forty kingdoms.</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR YONGLE:</strong> Good. But the expeditions are costly. The treasury complains.</p>
<p><strong>COURT TREASURER:</strong> Majesty, each voyage costs more than maintaining ten provinces. The ships, the crews, the gifts to barbarian kings—</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR YONGLE:</strong> The cost demonstrates our power. Let the barbarians see that China can spend on one voyage what their entire kingdoms are worth.</p>
<p><strong>CONFUCIAN ADVISOR:</strong> <em>(respectfully)</em> Majesty, the ancient sages taught that virtue spreads by example, not by spectacle. Would not the resources serve better improving the people’s welfare?</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR YONGLE:</strong> The people’s welfare depends on China’s strength. And China’s strength must be visible to all who might challenge it.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Private council meeting. Confucian officials debate policy without the Emperor present.</em></p>
<p><strong>SENIOR CONFUCIAN SCHOLAR:</strong> These ocean voyages violate every principle of proper governance. Resources wasted on barbarian lands while Chinese peasants struggle with taxes.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATE OFFICIAL:</strong> But the prestige, the tribute, the demonstration of imperial power—</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR CONFUCIAN SCHOLAR:</strong> Prestige? From barbarians? Their acknowledgment is worthless. True legitimacy comes from the Mandate of Heaven, not from foreign submission.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNGER OFFICIAL:</strong> What of the knowledge gained? The maps, the trading routes, the understanding of foreign lands?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR CONFUCIAN SCHOLAR:</strong> What use is knowledge of barbarian lands to proper Chinese administration? We should study the classics, perfect our agriculture, strengthen our defenses. Not chase phantoms across empty oceans.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Shipyard scene. The advanced technology on display—magnetic compasses, detailed star charts, sophisticated metallurgy.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> China’s technological superiority was overwhelming. While European sailors hugged coastlines, terrified of the open ocean, Chinese navigators crossed the Indian Ocean with magnetic compasses and detailed star charts.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Navigation room on treasure ship. CHIEF NAVIGATOR shows his instruments to visiting officials.</em></p>
<p><strong>CHIEF NAVIGATOR:</strong> The magnetic needle always points south. With this and the star charts, we can find any destination across the vastest ocean.</p>
<p><strong>VISITING MANDARIN:</strong> Remarkable. Do the barbarians possess such instruments?</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF NAVIGATOR:</strong> No, Excellence. They navigate by following coastlines, like ants following walls. The open ocean terrifies them.</p>
<p><strong>VISITING MANDARIN:</strong> Then they pose no threat to Chinese supremacy?</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF NAVIGATOR:</strong> None whatsoever. Their ships are toys compared to ours.</p>
<p><strong>VISITING MANDARIN:</strong> <em>(thoughtfully)</em> But what if they learn our techniques? What if they improve upon them?</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF NAVIGATOR:</strong> Impossible. Chinese navigation is perfect. It cannot be improved, only copied—and barbarians lack the intelligence to copy properly.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Imperial court, 1424. EMPEROR YONGLE has died suddenly. His son, EMPEROR HONGXI, meets with his advisors.</em></p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR HONGXI:</strong> My father’s great expeditions—they end with his death.</p>
<p><strong>CONFUCIAN ADVISOR:</strong> Wise, Majesty. Confucius taught that the superior man cultivates virtue at home before seeking influence abroad. Your father, may he rest in glory, perhaps... overextended the realm’s proper boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>COURT TREASURER:</strong> The expeditions drain the treasury. Seven voyages have cost what we might have spent improving the Grand Canal, strengthening the Great Wall, supporting ten thousand scholars.</p>
<p><strong>MILITARY ADVISOR:</strong> The northern borders face barbarian pressure. Mongol tribes grow restless. Should we not focus our strength where it is truly needed?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> <em>(entering)</em> Majesty, the fleets await your orders. The eighth voyage is prepared—</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR HONGXI:</strong> <em>(cutting him off)</em> The fleets will return home. The shipyards will close. China will turn inward, toward perfection of what we have, rather than pursuit of what we lack.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Majesty, we lack nothing—but the world lacks knowledge of China’s greatness. These voyages spread that knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>CONFUCIAN ADVISOR:</strong> Admiral, with respect, what barbarian’s knowledge of China’s greatness matters? The Son of Heaven’s legitimacy comes from Heaven itself, not from foreign recognition.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Private meeting between Zheng He and Emperor Hongxi.</em></p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> Majesty, I have served your father faithfully across seven voyages. The fleets are ready, the routes established, the foreign kingdoms expecting our return—</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR HONGXI:</strong> And that is precisely the problem, Admiral. Foreign kingdoms expecting Chinese tribute. China should not be expected by barbarians—China should be sufficient unto itself.</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> But the knowledge we’ve gained, the trade routes, the technological advances—</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR HONGXI:</strong> What knowledge surpasses what our ancestors already discovered? What trade do we need beyond what China produces? What technology matters beyond what Chinese craftsmen have perfected?</p>
<p><strong>ZHENG HE:</strong> <em>(frustrated)</em> Majesty, the world is vast. Surely there is more to learn, more to discover—</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR HONGXI:</strong> <em>(firmly)</em> Zheng He, you have served admirably. But admirability can become excess. China has shown the world its power. That is sufficient. Now China will show the world its wisdom—the wisdom to know when enough is enough.</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR HONGXI:</strong> The fleets will return home. The shipyards will close. China will turn inward, toward perfection.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Harbor scene. The treasure ships being broken up, their timbers used for ordinary construction.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Yet within a generation, this maritime empire simply vanished. The Yongle Emperor who had commissioned the great voyages died; his successors decided the expeditions were too expensive, too risky, too disruptive of proper Confucian order.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Council meeting, 1435. Mandarin bureaucrats debate policy.</em></p>
<p><strong>SENIOR MANDARIN:</strong> The treasure fleets served no legitimate purpose. They brought curiosities, not necessities. China is self-sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNGER MANDARIN:</strong> But the knowledge we gained, the maps we made, the trade routes we established—</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR MANDARIN:</strong> What use are trade routes when China produces everything China needs? What value are maps to barbarian lands when China contains all that matters?</p>
<p><strong>YOUNGER MANDARIN:</strong> What if the barbarians grow stronger? What if they threaten China?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR MANDARIN:</strong> <em>(laughing)</em> Barbarians? Threatening China? With their toy boats and primitive weapons? Impossible.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATE MANDARIN:</strong> But surely the knowledge itself has value? The navigation techniques, the shipbuilding methods?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR MANDARIN:</strong> Knowledge that distracts from proper Chinese learning is worse than ignorance. Better our scholars master Confucius than ocean charts.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Imperial Naval Academy, being converted to a Confucian school. FORMER ADMIRAL CHEN oversees the removal of navigational equipment.</em></p>
<p><strong>FORMER ADMIRAL CHEN:</strong> <em>(to assistant)</em> These star charts mapped the entire Indian Ocean. This compass guided fleets across thousands of li of open water.</p>
<p><strong>CONFUCIAN SCHOLAR:</strong> Admiral, these instruments will be stored. The building now serves education in proper subjects.</p>
<p><strong>FORMER ADMIRAL CHEN:</strong> Proper subjects?</p>
<p><strong>CONFUCIAN SCHOLAR:</strong> The classics. Poetry. Moral philosophy. History of Chinese dynasties. Skills that make proper officials, not wandering sailors.</p>
<p><strong>FORMER ADMIRAL CHEN:</strong> And navigation? Shipbuilding? Maritime strategy?</p>
<p><strong>CONFUCIAN SCHOLAR:</strong> What Chinese official needs to know of barbarian seas? Our borders are land borders. Our enemies are land enemies.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Imperial edict being proclaimed. Officials post notices forbidding ocean voyages.</em></p>
<p><strong>TOWN CRIER:</strong> By order of the Dragon Emperor: No subject of China shall build ocean-going vessels. No subject shall travel beyond China’s borders. The Middle Kingdom is sufficient unto itself.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Shipyard, abandoned. MASTER SHIPBUILDER WU speaks with his son.</em></p>
<p><strong>MASTER WU:</strong> <em>(sadly)</em> Three generations of my family built the treasure ships. Now the yard lies empty.</p>
<p><strong>SON:</strong> Father, could we not build smaller ships? Merchant vessels for coastal trade?</p>
<p><strong>MASTER WU:</strong> The edict forbids ocean-going construction. And the knowledge... <em>(gestures to empty workshops)</em> The techniques for building great ships require constant practice. Stop for a generation, and the skill dies.</p>
<p><strong>SON:</strong> But surely the plans, the drawings—</p>
<p><strong>MASTER WU:</strong> Burned. The new Emperor’s advisors said they encouraged dangerous thoughts. Better to forget than to remember wrongly.</p>
<p><em>Montage: Shipyards abandoned, maritime technology forgotten, sailors forced into other occupations.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The treasure fleets were broken up, the shipyards closed, the maritime technology allowed to rust away. Imperial edicts forbade Chinese citizens from building ocean-going vessels or traveling beyond China’s borders. The Middle Kingdom turned its back on the sea and withdrew behind the Great Wall.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Former naval officer, now a farmer, speaks to his son.</em></p>
<p><strong>FORMER ADMIRAL:</strong> I once commanded ships that could carry a thousand men across the vastest ocean. Now I plant rice.</p>
<p><strong>SON:</strong> Why did the Emperor abandon the fleets, Father?</p>
<p><strong>FORMER ADMIRAL:</strong> Because China is perfect. Perfect things do not change. They do not explore. They do not grow.</p>
<p><strong>SON:</strong> But you saw the world beyond China. Was it not worth knowing?</p>
<p><strong>FORMER ADMIRAL:</strong> <em>(sadly)</em> That is not for us to decide anymore. The Mandarins say foreign knowledge corrupts Chinese wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>SON:</strong> But what if they are wrong?</p>
<p><strong>FORMER ADMIRAL:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> Then China will discover their error when barbarian ships appear in our harbors. But by then, it will be too late to remember what we chose to forget.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Mandarin examination hall. Thousands of candidates study classical texts, memorizing ancient wisdom.</em></p>
<p><strong>EXAMINATION PROCTOR:</strong> Today you will demonstrate mastery of the classics. Knowledge of Confucius, Mencius, the ancient sages.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG CANDIDATE:</strong> Proctor, what of the knowledge gained from the treasure voyages? The navigation techniques, the foreign customs—</p>
<p><strong>EXAMINATION PROCTOR:</strong> Such knowledge is not tested here. We examine virtue, not curiosity. Wisdom, not wandering.</p>
<p><em>The candidate looks confused but returns to his classical texts.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Why would the most advanced maritime power in history deliberately abandon the oceans? The answer lay in the very success of Chinese civilisation. For two millennia, China had been the Middle Kingdom—prosperous, stable, superior to all neighboring peoples.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Palace garden. ELDERLY MANDARIN instructs young court officials in proper governance.</em></p>
<p><strong>ELDERLY MANDARIN:</strong> China has perfected the art of government. Our examinations produce the most learned officials. Our agriculture feeds the largest population. Our crafts produce the finest goods.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG OFFICIAL:</strong> But Master, the barbarian lands might teach us new methods—</p>
<p><strong>ELDERLY MANDARIN:</strong> <em>(stern)</em> What could barbarians teach the inheritors of five thousand years of wisdom? Our ancestors solved every problem worth solving.</p>
<p><strong>YOUNG OFFICIAL:</strong> But change, adaptation—</p>
<p><strong>ELDERLY MANDARIN:</strong> Change is corruption. Adaptation is weakness. China is eternal because China is perfect.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The Great Wall. Guards patrol while, unseen beyond, Portuguese ships explore the coast.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> What could barbarians teach the inheritors of Confucius? What wealth could compare to the abundance of Chinese agriculture and craftsmanship? Why risk the known prosperity of the homeland for unknown rewards beyond the horizon?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Coastal fort, 1517. Portuguese ships arrive. Chinese COASTAL COMMANDER examines the foreign vessels through a spyglass.</em></p>
<p><strong>COASTAL COMMANDER:</strong> Small ships, crude construction. Are these the ocean barbarians?</p>
<p><strong>LIEUTENANT:</strong> They request permission to trade, sir. They offer silver for silk and porcelain.</p>
<p><strong>COASTAL COMMANDER:</strong> <em>(dismissive)</em> Let them grovel properly first. They must acknowledge the Dragon Emperor’s supremacy.</p>
<p><strong>LIEUTENANT:</strong> Sir, their guns... they seem advanced. And their navigation—</p>
<p><strong>COASTAL COMMANDER:</strong> Parlor tricks. Chinese technology is supreme. It always has been.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Portuguese ship. PORTUGUESE CAPTAIN observes the Chinese response.</em></p>
<p><strong>PORTUGUESE CAPTAIN:</strong> They treat us like beggars, but look at their ships. They’re still using designs from centuries ago.</p>
<p><strong>PORTUGUESE NAVIGATOR:</strong> Captain, our charts show they once had great fleets. What happened to them?</p>
<p><strong>PORTUGUESE CAPTAIN:</strong> They forgot the sea. And now we rule it.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Imperial court, 1550. EMPEROR JIAJING receives disturbing reports.</em></p>
<p><strong>COURT MESSENGER:</strong> Majesty, the ocean barbarians grow bold. Their ships patrol our coasts. They demand trading rights.</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR JIAJING:</strong> Demand? Of China?</p>
<p><strong>MILITARY ADVISOR:</strong> They have weapons we have not seen, Majesty. Their ships move against the wind.</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR JIAJING:</strong> <em>(confused)</em> How is this possible? China possesses all knowledge worth possessing.</p>
<p><strong>CONFUCIAN ADVISOR:</strong> Perhaps... perhaps the knowledge was lost when we abandoned the treasure fleets?</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR JIAJING:</strong> <em>(angry)</em> We abandoned nothing! We chose to perfect what we had rather than chase barbarian chimeras!</p>
<p><em>But doubt has entered the imperial court.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The mandarin bureaucracy, trained in classical learning rather than practical navigation, saw the treasure fleets as wasteful adventures that served no legitimate purpose. Better to spend the empire’s resources on traditional priorities: maintaining the Grand Canal, reinforcing the Great Wall, supporting the examination system that produced properly educated officials.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Four centuries passed. The knowledge of navigation faded, the shipyards crumbled, the maritime skills died with their practitioners. China turned inward, perfecting its bureaucracy and forgetting the world beyond its borders. But the world had not forgotten China.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: 1839. First Opium War. British warships anchor off Canton.</em></p>
<p><strong>CHINESE HARBOR MASTER:</strong> <em>(to imperial messenger)</em> What manner of ships are these? They have no sails, yet they move against the wind!</p>
<p><strong>IMPERIAL MESSENGER:</strong> Impossible. Ships require wind to move.</p>
<p><strong>HARBOR MASTER:</strong> These ships move by fire and steam. And their guns... <em>(ships fire, destroying Chinese junks)</em> Their guns outrange ours by three times.</p>
<p><strong>IMPERIAL MESSENGER:</strong> Send word to Beijing. Request instructions from the Ministry of War.</p>
<p><strong>HARBOR MASTER:</strong> <em>(frantically)</em> By the time instructions arrive, they will have seized the entire harbor!</p>
<p><strong>IMPERIAL MESSENGER:</strong> I am a properly trained official. I follow proper procedures. I cannot simply... improvise!</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Imperial Palace. EMPEROR receives reports of defeats.</em></p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR DAOGUANG:</strong> How is this possible? China has ruled these seas for millennia.</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR MANDARIN:</strong> Majesty, our ancestors ruled these seas. We... chose other priorities.</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR DAOGUANG:</strong> What priorities could be more important than defending China?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR MANDARIN:</strong> Internal harmony, Majesty. Social order. Administrative efficiency. The treasure fleets were... disruptive.</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR DAOGUANG:</strong> And what good is administrative efficiency when barbarian fleets bombard our cities?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR MANDARIN:</strong> <em>(helplessly)</em> The barbarians should not be able to bombard our cities, Majesty. It violates the natural order.</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR DAOGUANG:</strong> <em>(bitterly)</em> Tell that to their cannons.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Return to university lecture hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> By 1842, China was forced to cede Hong Kong to Britain and open five ports to foreign trade. The same seas that Chinese treasure fleets had once ruled absolutely now belonged to European maritime powers.</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> But surely China could have rebuilt its navy? It had the resources.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Resources, yes. But not the knowledge. Four centuries of institutional neglect had systematically eliminated maritime expertise from Chinese civilization. The shipbuilders were gone, the navigators were dead, the institutional memory had been bureaucratized out of existence.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> So China chose bureaucratic stability over strategic flexibility?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> They optimized for what centralized systems always optimize for when given the choice—administrative convenience. It’s easier to manage an empire that doesn’t have unpredictable maritime commitments. Cheaper to defend borders that don’t include distant seas. More efficient to eliminate complex capabilities that might challenge bureaucratic control.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> Like a company that gets so focused on cost-cutting that it eliminates its research and development department.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Exactly. The institutional logic was perfect from the perspective of institutional maintenance. Remove the expensive, complex, unpredictable elements. Focus on what could be controlled, measured, administered. But what institutions optimize for isn’t necessarily what strategic reality requires.</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> So when strategic reality changed...</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The system couldn’t adapt fast enough to survive. China spent four centuries perfecting a bureaucracy optimized for a world where China was the only significant maritime power. When that world ended, the system had no mechanism for rapid adaptation. It could only do what it had always done—send requests up the hierarchy and wait for properly authorized responses.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> <em>(thoughtfully)</em> But by then it was too late.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> By the time the Qing dynasty recognized the need for a modern navy, the knowledge of how to build one had been systematically eliminated. China’s maritime supremacy died not from external conquest, but from internal optimization. The system worked exactly as designed—until the design assumptions no longer matched reality.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern museum in Beijing. CURATOR shows visitors models of Zheng He’s treasure ships.</em></p>
<p><strong>CURATOR:</strong> These models represent the largest wooden ships ever built. For a brief moment, China ruled the oceans.</p>
<p><strong>MUSEUM VISITOR:</strong> Why did they stop exploring?</p>
<p><strong>CURATOR:</strong> Because they believed they had already found everything worth finding. China was the center of the world. Why look beyond the center?</p>
<p><strong>MUSEUM VISITOR:</strong> But what if they had continued?</p>
<p><strong>CURATOR:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> History might have been very different.</p>
<p><em>Final shot: The harbor at Nanjing, now filled with modern cargo ships. The camera lingers on the water where the treasure fleets once anchored.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> When European ships arrived in Chinese waters a century later, they found an empire that had deliberately forgotten how to rule the seas. The technological knowledge still existed—but the will to use it had been systematically eliminated by a bureaucracy that prized stability above all other virtues. China’s very success had taught it to fear change, and that fear had cost it mastery of the world.</p>

<p>Civilisation.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherers, in clans, extended family, tribal and nomadic.</p>
<p>The invention of agriculture; man bending the world to his will, rather than adapting. </p>
<p>Settled in place, few things threaten. What <em>can?</em> We strive in concert, till our collective strength is geological in scale. With works of dam and road, on ever greater scale we master the wild and force it to submit.</p>
<p>And yet, without fail, we rise up! Only to fall again. And the night is long, as only those who dwell in it could truly tell.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>We know why civilisation rises; it’s obvious. A few good seasons, men band together and their strength multiplies. The only real threat is other men. But why is it inevitable that they fall again, they who are so mighty?</p>
<p>Egypt and Rome have fallen in their turn. China turned from the seas that might have carried it to world dominion. Yet nothing is completely forgotten, and empires rise from the ruins with ever increasing speed. Now we turn to the West, to civilizations born from the ashes of Rome itself.</p>
<h2 id="id-57">Episode 4: Europe - The Curse of Gold and the Burden of Success</h2>
<h3 id="id-58">Part I: Spain - The Curse of Gold</h3>
<p><em>FADE IN: The port of Seville, 1540. Massive galleons unload chests of silver from the New World. The camera follows Spanish DOCKWORKERS straining under the weight of treasure that would bankrupt kingdoms.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Never had any nation commanded such wealth as Spain in the sixteenth century. Silver from the mines of Potosí flowed across the Atlantic in quantities that defied imagination.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Counting house in Seville. MERCHANT RODRIGO MENDOZA examines ledgers with his ACCOUNTANT.</em></p>
<p><strong>RODRIGO:</strong> How much silver arrived on this fleet?</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNTANT:</strong> Forty-three tonnes, Don Rodrigo. More than all of Europe possessed a century ago.</p>
<p><strong>RODRIGO:</strong> <em>(overwhelmed)</em> And the next fleet?</p>
<p><strong>ACCOUNTANT:</strong> Twice as much. The mines produce faster than we can count.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Spanish nobleman’s palace. COUNT FERNANDO DE ALBA dines in incredible luxury while SERVANTS attend his every need.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Spanish nobles lived like Renaissance princes while their counterparts in France and England struggled to maintain modest estates.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: The count’s study. His STEWARD brings troubling news.</em></p>
<p><strong>STEWARD:</strong> My lord, the wheat harvest has failed again. The peasants require assistance.</p>
<p><strong>COUNT FERNANDO:</strong> Buy grain from wherever it costs least. Dutch grain, French grain—what matter? We have silver enough to buy the world.</p>
<p><strong>STEWARD:</strong> But my lord, perhaps we should encourage local farming, support our own—</p>
<p><strong>COUNT FERNANDO:</strong> <em>(dismissive)</em> Why struggle with reluctant soil when American silver buys whatever we need? Let the Dutch farm. We shall count coins.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Spanish workshop, abandoned and dusty. Former CRAFTSMAN PABLO shows his son the empty looms.</em></p>
<p><strong>PABLO:</strong> Once, these looms produced the finest cloth in Christendom.</p>
<p><strong>SON:</strong> What happened, Father?</p>
<p><strong>PABLO:</strong> The silver happened. Why weave when you can buy cheaper cloth from Flanders? Why craft when you can purchase?</p>
<p><strong>SON:</strong> But what shall we do for work?</p>
<p><strong>PABLO:</strong> <em>(bitter)</em> Count coins, like everyone else. If there are any left to count.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Council chamber in Madrid, 1580. KING PHILIP II meets with his advisors. Maps cover the walls showing Spain’s vast empire.</em></p>
<p><strong>KING PHILIP II:</strong> Our empire spans the globe. From the Philippines to Peru, from Milan to the Caribbean. How fare our dominions?</p>
<p><strong>COLONIAL MINISTER:</strong> Majesty, the empire requires ever more officials. More governors, more tax collectors, more clerks to count the silver.</p>
<p><strong>TREASURY MINISTER:</strong> The administrative costs grow yearly. Half the silver now goes to pay those who collect the other half.</p>
<p><strong>KING PHILIP II:</strong> But surely the silver is sufficient?</p>
<p><strong>TREASURY MINISTER:</strong> For now, Majesty. But what if the mines... falter?</p>
<p><strong>KING PHILIP II:</strong> <em>(confident)</em> Impossible. God has blessed Spain with endless wealth. It is our divine right.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Peruvian silver mine, Potosí. Indigenous MINERS work in horrific conditions. SPANISH OVERSEER CAPTAIN GARCÍA surveys the operation.</em></p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN GARCÍA:</strong> How much silver this month?</p>
<p><strong>MINE FOREMAN:</strong> Less than last month, Captain. The easy veins are exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN GARCÍA:</strong> Then dig deeper. Work longer. Spain requires silver.</p>
<p><strong>MINE FOREMAN:</strong> The workers are dying, sir. The mines are treacherous.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN GARCÍA:</strong> <em>(coldly)</em> Then bring more workers. The empire depends on silver, not on the lives of Indians.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Spanish Armada preparation, 1588. Ships being loaded with supplies. ADMIRAL SANTA CRUZ addresses his captains.</em></p>
<p><strong>ADMIRAL SANTA CRUZ:</strong> We sail to crush the English heretics. Our ships are magnificent, our cause divine.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN MENDEZ:</strong> Admiral, the English ships are smaller but faster. Their guns—</p>
<p><strong>ADMIRAL SANTA CRUZ:</strong> Spanish gold has built the greatest fleet in history. What can English poverty accomplish against Spanish might?</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN MENDEZ:</strong> But perhaps we should study their tactics, adapt our methods—</p>
<p><strong>ADMIRAL SANTA CRUZ:</strong> Spain does not learn from pirates. Spain teaches lessons.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Aftermath of the Armada’s defeat. Broken ships washing ashore on English beaches.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Armada’s defeat shattered the myth of Spanish invincibility, but Spanish leaders could not understand why their gold had failed them.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Spanish court, 1598. KING PHILIP III (Philip II’s son) meets with his advisors in a palace that still glitters with wealth.</em></p>
<p><strong>NEW TREASURY MINISTER:</strong> Majesty, the silver fleet was attacked by English pirates. Half the treasure is lost.</p>
<p><strong>KING PHILIP III:</strong> Then send a larger fleet next year. Double the escort.</p>
<p><strong>NEW TREASURY MINISTER:</strong> Sire, that will cost more than the silver we protect. And the mines report declining yields.</p>
<p><strong>KING PHILIP III:</strong> <em>(frustrated)</em> How can this be? We own mountains of silver!</p>
<p><strong>ECONOMIC ADVISOR:</strong> Your Majesty, perhaps we should develop other industries. The Dutch prosper through trade, the English through manufacturing—</p>
<p><strong>KING PHILIP III:</strong> Spain does not copy lesser nations! We possess the wealth of the Indies!</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Spanish textile workshop, 1620. Only a few looms remain operational. The former COUNT FERNANDO (now elderly) speaks with a DUTCH MERCHANT.</em></p>
<p><strong>DUTCH MERCHANT:</strong> I can offer you fine cloth at half the price of local production.</p>
<p><strong>COUNT FERNANDO:</strong> <em>(aged and weary)</em> How is this possible? You have no silver mines.</p>
<p><strong>DUTCH MERCHANT:</strong> We have something better—the knowledge of how to make wealth, not just spend it.</p>
<p><strong>COUNT FERNANDO:</strong> But Spanish silver built this palace, this empire—</p>
<p><strong>DUTCH MERCHANT:</strong> Spanish silver bought temporary glory. Dutch ingenuity builds lasting prosperity.</p>
<p><em>The count looks around his decaying estate, understanding finally dawning.</em></p>
<p><em>SCENE: Spanish port, 1640. Far fewer ships arrive. DOCKWORKERS stand idle. The former merchant RODRIGO, now old and poor, speaks to his grandson.</em></p>
<p><strong>RODRIGO:</strong> Once, these docks groaned under the weight of treasure. Now look—emptiness.</p>
<p><strong>GRANDSON:</strong> What happened to all the silver, Grandfather?</p>
<p><strong>RODRIGO:</strong> We spent it all buying things we could have made ourselves. We bought the world, but forgot how to build it.</p>
<p><strong>GRANDSON:</strong> Can we not begin again?</p>
<p><strong>RODRIGO:</strong> <em>(sadly)</em> We forgot how. We taught our children to count coins, not to create value. Now the coins are gone, and we remember nothing else.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Final shot of Spain - abandoned silver works, empty ports, crumbling palaces. Camera focuses on a single remaining piece of silver, tarnished and forgotten.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The silver that made Spain master of Europe became its undoing. Easy wealth bred easy assumptions—that prosperity would last forever, that learning was unnecessary when gold could buy anything, that strength came from possession rather than production. When the silver faded, Spain discovered it had forgotten how to create the very wealth it had so carelessly consumed.</p>
<h3 id="id-59">Part II: Britain - The Burden of Success</h3>
<p><em>FADE IN: Manchester textile mill, 1840. Steam-powered looms thunder in vast industrial halls. The camera follows MILL OWNER THOMAS ASHWORTH as he surveys his empire of iron and cotton.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> At its height, the British Empire governed a quarter of the world’s population and controlled nearly a quarter of its land surface. The workshop of the world, Britain’s factories clothed humanity while British ships carried British goods to markets their competitors could not reach.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Ashworth’s office overlooking the mill floor. His FOREMAN brings production reports.</em></p>
<p><strong>THOMAS ASHWORTH:</strong> How many yards this week?</p>
<p><strong>FOREMAN:</strong> Fifty thousand, sir. More than all of India produced in a year, before we arrived.</p>
<p><strong>THOMAS ASHWORTH:</strong> And our orders?</p>
<p><strong>FOREMAN:</strong> From Canada, Australia, India, Africa—the entire Empire wants Manchester cotton. We cannot keep pace with demand.</p>
<p><strong>THOMAS ASHWORTH:</strong> <em>(confident)</em> Then we shall build more mills. British ingenuity has no limits.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: London dock, same period. Massive ships unload goods from across the Empire. DOCKMASTER WILLIAM HARTLEY supervises the controlled chaos.</em></p>
<p><strong>DOCKMASTER HARTLEY:</strong> <em>(to his assistant)</em> Raw cotton from America, wool from Australia, tea from India, silk from China. The world’s wealth flows through London.</p>
<p><strong>DOCK ASSISTANT:</strong> And flows out again as finished goods, sir. British manufacturing leads the world.</p>
<p><strong>DOCKMASTER HARTLEY:</strong> As it always shall. What foreigner can match British industry?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Colonial office, Whitehall, 1870. COLONIAL SECRETARY LORD CARNARVON meets with officials planning imperial administration.</em></p>
<p><strong>LORD CARNARVON:</strong> The Empire now spans four continents. How many administrators do we require?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR CLERK:</strong> At least ten thousand in India alone, my lord. Plus military garrisons, civil servants, judges, tax collectors—</p>
<p><strong>JUNIOR OFFICIAL:</strong> The administrative costs grow yearly. Each new territory requires more bureaucrats than the last.</p>
<p><strong>LORD CARNARVON:</strong> But surely the profits justify the expense?</p>
<p><strong>SENIOR CLERK:</strong> For now, my lord. But the colonies increasingly require investment rather than providing returns.</p>
<p><strong>LORD CARNARVON:</strong> <em>(dismissive)</em> Temporary adjustments. The Empire exists for Britain’s benefit, not the reverse.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Ashworth’s mill, 1880. THOMAS ASHWORTH (now elderly) meets with his son JAMES to discuss troubling news.</em></p>
<p><strong>JAMES ASHWORTH:</strong> Father, the German mills undercut our prices. Their new machinery produces cotton goods for half our cost.</p>
<p><strong>THOMAS ASHWORTH:</strong> Impossible. British engineering is supreme.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES ASHWORTH:</strong> Not anymore. They studied our methods, then improved them. Their workers are better trained, their managers more efficient.</p>
<p><strong>THOMAS ASHWORTH:</strong> <em>(angry)</em> Germans? Learning from us? The students cannot surpass the masters!</p>
<p><strong>JAMES ASHWORTH:</strong> But Father, perhaps we should modernize our own methods—</p>
<p><strong>THOMAS ASHWORTH:</strong> These mills built the Empire! They need no improvement!</p>
<p><em>Cut to: British steel works, Sheffield, 1890. STEELMAKER HENRY BESSEMER examines his furnaces with growing concern.</em></p>
<p><strong>BESSEMER:</strong> The Americans order less steel each month. Their own mills supply their needs.</p>
<p><strong>PLANT MANAGER:</strong> And the Germans, sir. They’ve learned our techniques and bettered them.</p>
<p><strong>BESSEMER:</strong> How is this possible? We invented modern steelmaking!</p>
<p><strong>PLANT MANAGER:</strong> They sent students to learn from us, then returned home to build newer, better works. While we maintained our old methods, they innovated.</p>
<p><strong>BESSEMER:</strong> <em>(bitter)</em> We taught them too well.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Colonial office, 1914. LORD GREY receives reports as World War I begins.</em></p>
<p><strong>MILITARY ADVISOR:</strong> My lord, defending the Empire requires forces on four continents. India, Africa, the Pacific, the Caribbean—</p>
<p><strong>LORD GREY:</strong> What will this cost?</p>
<p><strong>TREASURY OFFICIAL:</strong> More than the Empire earns, sir. The colonies that once enriched Britain now drain the treasury.</p>
<p><strong>LORD GREY:</strong> But surely the Empire’s resources—</p>
<p><strong>TREASURY OFFICIAL:</strong> Must be developed with borrowed money, my lord. We borrow to govern what once governed itself.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Industrial boardroom, Birmingham, 1925. INDUSTRIALIST SIR ROBERT BALDWIN meets with his board as economic reports arrive.</em></p>
<p><strong>SIR ROBERT:</strong> Our markets shrink yearly. America, Germany, even Japan produce what we once supplied.</p>
<p><strong>BOARD MEMBER 1:</strong> Perhaps we should invest in new technologies, new methods—</p>
<p><strong>SIR ROBERT:</strong> With what capital? Half our profits go to maintain the colonies.</p>
<p><strong>BOARD MEMBER 2:</strong> Then perhaps... perhaps we should reconsider the Empire’s value?</p>
<p><strong>SIR ROBERT:</strong> <em>(shocked)</em> Abandon the Empire? Britain IS the Empire!</p>
<p><strong>BOARD MEMBER 1:</strong> But what if the Empire is now abandoning us?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: House of Commons, 1945. PRIME MINISTER CLEMENT ATTLEE addresses Parliament as the reality of imperial decline becomes undeniable.</em></p>
<p><strong>ATTLEE:</strong> The war is won, but the cost... The Empire that once enriched Britain now impoverishes us.</p>
<p><strong>CONSERVATIVE MP:</strong> Prime Minister, surely the colonies will recover, return to profitability—</p>
<p><strong>ATTLEE:</strong> The colonies seek independence, not integration. India, Burma, Ceylon—all demand freedom from British rule.</p>
<p><strong>CONSERVATIVE MP:</strong> But without the Empire, what is Britain?</p>
<p><strong>ATTLEE:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> That, gentlemen, is what we must discover.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Final meeting in the same mill where we began. JAMES ASHWORTH (now elderly) speaks with a JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN who is purchasing the mill’s machinery.</em></p>
<p><strong>JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN:</strong> We will ship these looms to Osaka. Japanese workers will operate what British workers built.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES ASHWORTH:</strong> How did this happen? Britain led the world in manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN:</strong> You taught us well. Then you stopped learning while we continued studying.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES ASHWORTH:</strong> But we were the workshop of the world—</p>
<p><strong>JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN:</strong> You were. Now you must discover what you shall become.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Modern London financial district. The camera shows gleaming towers where colonial offices once stood.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> By the time British leaders recognized the need for change, the moment for change had passed. The United States and Soviet Union had divided the world between them, leaving little room for traditional European empires.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern economist being interviewed in front of the defunct mill.</em></p>
<p><strong>ECONOMIST:</strong> <em>(to camera)</em> Britain’s tragedy was the tragedy of success. The Empire that made them great became a burden they could not carry. The industries that led the world became museums they could not abandon.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Could they have adapted?</p>
<p><strong>ECONOMIST:</strong> Perhaps. But adaptation requires admitting that success is temporary. And that’s the hardest lesson any civilization learns.</p>
<p><em>Final shot: The sun setting over empty dock yards where British ships once carried the world’s commerce.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The sun had finally set on the British Empire, leaving its inheritors to discover that imperial glory and domestic prosperity were not the same thing. The burden of ruling the world had become heavier than the world’s wealth could support. But into the power vacuum left by Europe’s exhaustion, a new giant was stirring—one that would rise not by conquering the world’s territories, but by conquering its ideas.</p>

<p><em>FADE IN: Lowell, Massachusetts, 1820. Water-powered textile mills line the Merrimack River. The camera follows SAMUEL SLATER, a British engineer, as he examines American machinery.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> America began its industrial rise not with original invention, but with brilliant adaptation. While Britain jealously guarded its manufacturing secrets, enterprising Americans learned by observation, imitation, and improvement.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Mill office. Slater meets with American MILL OWNER FRANCIS CABOT LOWELL.</em></p>
<p><strong>SLATER:</strong> These mills use the same principles as Manchester, but simplified. More efficient.</p>
<p><strong>LOWELL:</strong> We studied British methods, then asked: how can we do this better?</p>
<p><strong>SLATER:</strong> You mean faster, cheaper?</p>
<p><strong>LOWELL:</strong> I mean smarter. British mills follow tradition. American mills follow results.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The mill floor. American workers operate machines that look familiar but work differently—faster, with fewer hands.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Samuel Slater brought British textile technology to America—stolen, the British claimed. Adapted, Americans replied. The distinction would prove crucial.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: American factory, 1840. FACTORY MANAGER JOHN HALL shows visitors his revolutionary production line.</em></p>
<p><strong>HALL:</strong> Each worker performs one specialized task. No craftsman makes the entire product—but each product is identical to every other.</p>
<p><strong>BRITISH VISITOR:</strong> But this destroys the craft tradition! Where is the artisan’s skill?</p>
<p><strong>HALL:</strong> Skill is in the system, not the individual. Any man can learn one task perfectly. Few can learn all tasks adequately.</p>
<p><strong>BRITISH VISITOR:</strong> It seems... mechanical.</p>
<p><strong>HALL:</strong> Exactly. And therefore scalable.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Wide shot showing dozens of workers producing hundreds of identical items.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The American System, they called it—mass production using interchangeable parts. What British craftsmen made one at a time, American factories made by the hundred.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Ford Motor Company, Highland Park, 1913. HENRY FORD walks the assembly line with his assistant, CHARLES SORENSEN.</em></p>
<p><strong>FORD:</strong> Fifteen minutes to assemble one automobile. Last year it took twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>SORENSEN:</strong> The men master one operation, then repeat it perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>FORD:</strong> We’ve applied Lowell’s textile principles to everything. Even the workers are interchangeable parts.</p>
<p><strong>SORENSEN:</strong> Henry, that sounds rather... cold.</p>
<p><strong>FORD:</strong> <em>(pragmatic)</em> Cold but effective. Every American family will own an automobile—because every American worker can afford what he makes.</p>
<p><em>Montage: Assembly line production spreads across American industry. Cars, radios, refrigerators—all made the American way.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> While Europeans debated whether mass production destroyed traditional values, Americans asked only whether it worked. And it worked spectacularly.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Ellis Island, 1905. Immigrants from across Europe disembark. IMMIGRATION OFFICER WILLIAM HARRIS processes new arrivals.</em></p>
<p><strong>HARRIS:</strong> Name?</p>
<p><strong>ITALIAN IMMIGRANT:</strong> Giuseppe Marconi.</p>
<p><strong>HARRIS:</strong> Occupation?</p>
<p><strong>MARCONI:</strong> Engineer. I study wireless signals in Italy.</p>
<p><strong>HARRIS:</strong> We got plenty of work for engineers here. What can you build?</p>
<p><strong>MARCONI:</strong> Anything, sir. I learn fast.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Laboratory scene. Marconi works alongside GERMAN PHYSICIST and IRISH INVENTOR, all developing new technologies.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> America’s greatest import was not raw materials but human talent. Every brain drain from Europe became America’s brain gain.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Bell Telephone Laboratories, 1925. ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL meets with his diverse research team—scientists from Scotland, Germany, Russia.</em></p>
<p><strong>BELL:</strong> Gentlemen, we need smaller, clearer, more reliable telephone equipment.</p>
<p><strong>GERMAN SCIENTIST:</strong> In Germany, we studied vacuum tube amplification—</p>
<p><strong>RUSSIAN SCIENTIST:</strong> Soviet research shows frequency modulation possibilities—</p>
<p><strong>SCOTTISH ENGINEER:</strong> And British work on switching systems could automate connections—</p>
<p><strong>BELL:</strong> Excellent. Combine all approaches. Build the best system, regardless of where the ideas originated.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Patent office, overwhelmed with applications from inventors of every nationality.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> While other nations hoarded their innovations, America imported ideas as eagerly as it imported people. Why reinvent when you could improve?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, 1943. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER coordinates scientists, many of whom carry briefcases marked with British security seals.</em></p>
<p><strong>OPPENHEIMER:</strong> The MAUD Committee’s work on uranium-235 separation—without the British calculations, we’d still be guessing whether this is even possible.</p>
<p><strong>JAMES CHADWICK:</strong> <em>(British physicist)</em> We had the theory worked out in 1941. Critical mass, separation methods, bomb design—all proven feasible.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL GROVES:</strong> So why didn’t Britain build it first?</p>
<p><strong>CHADWICK:</strong> Resources, General. We were fighting for survival. America has the industrial capacity to turn proof-of-concept into reality.</p>
<p><strong>ENRICO FERMI:</strong> In Europe, we theorize brilliantly. In America, you manufacture brilliantly.</p>
<p><strong>OPPENHEIMER:</strong> The difference between innovation and application. Britain invents the jet engine—Germany flies it. Britain designs the atomic bomb—America builds it.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Split screen showing British laboratory with working jet engine prototype alongside German Me 262 fighter planes in combat.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Here was America’s true genius—not original discovery, but taking others’ innovations from laboratory to battlefield. While Whittle’s jet engine produced 88 pounds of thrust on a British test bench after twelve years of development, German engineers studied the concept and put the Me 262 in the air within months.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: British research facility, 1940. SIR FRANK WHITTLE examines his jet engine while MINISTRY OFFICIAL takes notes.</em></p>
<p><strong>WHITTLE:</strong> The turbine works perfectly. Given proper funding, we could have aircraft applications within—</p>
<p><strong>MINISTRY OFFICIAL:</strong> How soon could we have a practical demonstration for the committee?</p>
<p><strong>WHITTLE:</strong> Sir, this is the demonstration. The principle is proven. We need production facilities, not more testing.</p>
<p><strong>MINISTRY OFFICIAL:</strong> Yes, well, we must be thorough. Perhaps another review next quarter?</p>
<p><em>Cut to: German factory, 1944. Mass production of jet engines in full swing.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The atomic bomb represented pure American method—take British theoretical work, German engineering insights, Hungarian mathematical brilliance, and Italian experimental technique, then marshal unprecedented resources to move from concept to deployment in under three years.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Atomic test explosion in the desert.</em></p>
<p><em>SCENE: Congressional hearing room, Washington, 1946. Senator BRIEN McMAHON addresses a committee reviewing the Atomic Energy Act.</em></p>
<p><strong>SENATOR McMahON:</strong> American atomic secrets must remain American. No foreign nation, ally or otherwise, shall receive atomic information developed with American resources.</p>
<p><strong>COMMITTEE MEMBER:</strong> But Senator, the British provided the foundational research. The MAUD Committee’s work—</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR McMahON:</strong> That was wartime cooperation. This is peacetime security. America developed the bomb. America controls the bomb.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: British Embassy, Washington. BRITISH AMBASSADOR LORD INVERCHAPEL reads the McMahon Act with growing dismay.</em></p>
<p><strong>LORD INVERCHAPEL:</strong> <em>(to aide)</em> They’ve cut us off completely. All atomic research, all nuclear technology—classified as American secrets.</p>
<p><strong>BRITISH AIDE:</strong> But sir, Chadwick, Peierls, Frisch—they helped design the bloody thing!</p>
<p><strong>LORD INVERCHAPEL:</strong> Apparently gratitude expires when the war ends.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: British Ministry of Defence, London, 1947. CLEMENT ATTLEE meets with scientific advisors.</em></p>
<p><strong>ATTLEE:</strong> Can we develop our own atomic program?</p>
<p><strong>SCIENTIST:</strong> We have the knowledge, Prime Minister, but not the industrial base. America gained that advantage by using our research.</p>
<p><strong>ATTLEE:</strong> So we taught them to fish, and now they own the lake?</p>
<p><strong>SCIENTIST:</strong> Precisely, sir.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Here was the first crack in America’s adaptive genius. Having learned to import innovation, America now began to hoard it. The open system that had made them great was closing—not to enemies, but to allies.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Post-war factory, 1946. Veterans return to American manufacturing jobs. FACTORY OWNER JAMES REUTHER addresses his workforce.</em></p>
<p><strong>REUTHER:</strong> Boys, you’ve seen the world. You’ve seen how other countries make things. How do we compare?</p>
<p><strong>VETERAN 1:</strong> Their methods are older, sir. Less efficient.</p>
<p><strong>VETERAN 2:</strong> But some of their ideas... German precision, Japanese attention to detail...</p>
<p><strong>REUTHER:</strong> Then let’s learn from them too. America improves everything—including improvement itself.</p>
<p><em>Montage: American factories incorporating techniques learned from defeated enemies—Japanese quality control, German precision engineering.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Even in victory, America remained a student. The secret of American success was the willingness to admit that success could always be improved.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Corporate boardroom, General Motors, 1955. EXECUTIVES celebrate record profits.</em></p>
<p><strong>GM EXECUTIVE 1:</strong> We’re the largest corporation in history. Bigger than most national economies.</p>
<p><strong>GM EXECUTIVE 2:</strong> Our cars, our methods, our management—the world copies America now.</p>
<p><strong>GM EXECUTIVE 3:</strong> What more could we learn from foreigners? We’ve surpassed them all.</p>
<p><em>The mood shifts subtly. Confidence becomes complacency.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> But observe the subtle change—from learning from the world to teaching the world. From adapting ideas to proclaiming superiority. Modern America would be mortified to learn it was following in the footsteps of <em>China</em>. </p>
<p><em>SCENE: University lecture hall, 1960. Business school PROFESSOR WILLIAM WHYTE teaches American management methods.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR WHYTE:</strong> American management science is the pinnacle of organizational efficiency. We’ve solved the problems of industrial coordination.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN STUDENT:</strong> Professor, what about other approaches? Japanese methods, European innovations—</p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR WHYTE:</strong> Interesting curiosities, but inferior to American systems. We lead, they follow.</p>
<p><strong>FOREIGN STUDENT:</strong> But surely there’s always more to learn—</p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR WHYTE:</strong> From whom? We’ve perfected management. The rest is mere implementation.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Japanese factory, same period. JAPANESE ENGINEERS study American methods while developing their own improvements.</em></p>
<p><strong>JAPANESE ENGINEER 1:</strong> Americans perfect mass production, but waste much material.</p>
<p><strong>JAPANESE ENGINEER 2:</strong> Their quality control happens after production. Ours should happen during production.</p>
<p><strong>JAPANESE ENGINEER 1:</strong> They separate thinking from doing. Perhaps integration works better?</p>
<p><strong>JAPANESE ENGINEER 2:</strong> Let us learn from America—then teach America what it forgot to learn.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: American auto factory, 1975. PLANT MANAGER reads reports of declining sales to worried executives.</em></p>
<p><strong>PLANT MANAGER:</strong> Japanese cars outsell ours in small-car markets. Their quality ratings exceed ours.</p>
<p><strong>EXECUTIVE 1:</strong> How is that possible? They learned from us!</p>
<p><strong>PLANT MANAGER:</strong> They learned, then kept learning. We learned, then stopped.</p>
<p><strong>EXECUTIVE 2:</strong> But we invented modern manufacturing! We have the most advanced methods—</p>
<p><strong>PLANT MANAGER:</strong> We had them. Twenty years ago. The students became the teachers while we became the past.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Congressional hearing room, 1980s. AUTO INDUSTRY CEOs testify before Congress about foreign competition.</em></p>
<p><strong>CONGRESSMAN:</strong> How did American automotive leadership disappear so quickly?</p>
<p><strong>AUTO CEO:</strong> Foreign governments subsidize their industries unfairly—</p>
<p><strong>CONGRESSMAN:</strong> But what about quality, efficiency, innovation?</p>
<p><strong>AUTO CEO:</strong> American methods are proven. We don’t need to change what works.</p>
<p><strong>CONGRESSMAN:</strong> But it’s not working anymore, is it?</p>
<p><em>The CEO has no good answer.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The America that had risen by learning from everyone began to believe its own mythology—that American innovation was inherently superior, that American methods needed no improvement, that the student had nothing left to learn.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Silicon Valley, 1990s. Tech billionaires celebrate the internet boom.</em></p>
<p><strong>TECH CEO:</strong> We’ve revolutionized human communication. American innovation leads the world.</p>
<p><strong>VENTURE CAPITALIST:</strong> The internet, personal computers, mobile phones—all American inventions.</p>
<p><strong>TECH CEO:</strong> We don’t need to learn from anyone. The world learns from us.</p>
<p><em>But in the background, we see foreign engineers working on their own innovations—Chinese manufacturing, Korean displays, Taiwanese chips.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The pattern repeated. American tech companies, drunk on their success, forgot that adaptation—not invention—had always been America’s true strength.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern corporate meeting, 2010s. AMERICAN EXECUTIVES discuss competition from Chinese tech companies.</em></p>
<p><strong>EXECUTIVE 1:</strong> How are Chinese companies developing so quickly?</p>
<p><strong>EXECUTIVE 2:</strong> They’re stealing our ideas, copying our methods—</p>
<p><strong>CONSULTANT:</strong> Actually, they’re doing what we did—learning from everyone, then improving on what they learned.</p>
<p><strong>EXECUTIVE 1:</strong> But that’s what we do!</p>
<p><strong>CONSULTANT:</strong> When did we last fundamentally change our approach based on foreign insights?</p>
<p><em>Silence around the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The great adapter had stopped adapting. The nation that rose by importing ideas began to believe it had nothing left to import.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Final scene in a modern American factory being retooled with German robotics, Japanese lean manufacturing, and Scandinavian worker cooperation methods.</em></p>
<p><strong>FACTORY MANAGER:</strong> <em>(to camera)</em> We’re learning again. Studying best practices worldwide. Maybe that’s what we should never have stopped doing.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> What made America stop learning?</p>
<p><strong>FACTORY MANAGER:</strong> Success. We got so good at what we did, we forgot that what we did was learn from everyone else.</p>
<p><em>Final shot: American and foreign engineers working together on new manufacturing processes—the cycle beginning again.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> America rose to global dominance not through superior innovation, but through superior adaptation—the willingness to learn from everyone, borrow from everywhere, improve on everything. Its decline began when it mistook temporary success for permanent superiority, when the student decided it had graduated from the need to learn.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern corporate headquarters. EXECUTIVE points to a wall showing the rise and fall of civilizations.</em></p>
<p><strong>EXECUTIVE:</strong> <em>(to camera)</em> Egypt, Rome, China, Spain, Britain, America—they all followed the same pattern. But what was the pattern? What connected them all?</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> To understand why civilizations fall, we must look deeper than individual stories. We must examine the thread that connects every collapse, every decline, every transformation from strength to weakness.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-62" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">Treadmill 6 &mdash; Centralism</h1>
<p>Civilisation.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherers, in clans, extended family, tribal and nomadic.</p>
<p>The invention of agriculture; man bending the world to his will, rather than adapting. </p>
<p>Settled in place, few things threaten. What <em>can?</em> We strive in concert, till our collective strength rivals is geological in scale. With works of dam and road, on ever greater scale we master the wild and force it to submit.</p>
<p>And yet, without fail, we rise up! Only to fall again. And the night is long, as only those who dwell in it could truly tell.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>We know why civilisation rises; it’s obvious. A few good seasons, men band together and their strength multiplies. The only real threat is other men. But why is it inevitable that they fall again, they who are so mighty?</p>
<p>Egypt, Rome, China, Spain, Britain, America—each rose higher than the last, each dominated their age completely. But what connected them? What thread runs through every collapse, every decline? The answer is both simple and profound: the very thing that made them strong also made them weak. They all learned to concentrate power, to centralize authority, to coordinate effort through unified command. And that concentration, initially their greatest strength, became their fatal weakness.</p>
<h2 id="id-63">Episode 6: The Fox and the Henhouse - How Centralism Corrupts Everything</h2>
<p><em>FADE IN: Ancient Egypt, construction of a massive irrigation project. Thousands of workers coordinate under centralized direction.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Centralization made civilizations possible. When scattered tribes learned to coordinate their efforts under unified authority, they became unstoppable.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Egyptian royal court. PHARAOH KHUFU coordinates with his CHIEF ENGINEER and RESOURCE MINISTER to plan the Great Pyramid.</em></p>
<p><strong>KHUFU:</strong> The pyramid requires stone from Aswan, copper from Sinai, workers from throughout the kingdom. Only unified command can coordinate such complexity.</p>
<p><strong>CHIEF ENGINEER:</strong> Majesty, local governors could manage their regions independently—</p>
<p><strong>KHUFU:</strong> And achieve what? Small, separate efforts? No. Great works require great authority. All must serve the single vision.</p>
<p><strong>RESOURCE MINISTER:</strong> The governors will resist centralized control, Majesty.</p>
<p><strong>KHUFU:</strong> Then we must make resistance impossible. The center must hold all real power.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The construction site, showing unprecedented coordination of materials and labor from across the known world.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> This was centralization’s promise—that unified command could achieve what scattered efforts never could. And for a time, the promise held true.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman Senate house, early Republic. CONSUL MARCUS VALERIUS addresses fellow senators about organizing defense against Celtic tribes.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARCUS VALERIUS:</strong> Senators, the Gauls attack our borders in coordinated waves. Only coordinated response can defeat them.</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR APPIUS:</strong> Each city has defended itself for centuries. Why must Rome command all?</p>
<p><strong>MARCUS VALERIUS:</strong> Because divided, we face destruction in detail. United under single command, we become invincible.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Battle scene showing Roman military coordination defeating numerically superior but disorganized enemies.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Roman legions conquered the world not through superior numbers but through superior coordination. Centralized command made them unbeatable.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Chinese imperial palace, Han Dynasty. EMPEROR WU coordinates massive infrastructure projects with his ministers.</em></p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR WU:</strong> The Grand Canal will connect north and south, the Great Wall will defend our borders, the Silk Road will bring us wealth. Only imperial coordination can achieve this scale.</p>
<p><strong>MINISTER OF WORKS:</strong> Majesty, such projects require resources from every province.</p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR WU:</strong> Then every province must contribute. Local authorities cannot see beyond their boundaries. Only the center can see the whole.</p>
<p><em>Montage: Massive Chinese infrastructure projects transforming the landscape.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Centralization worked. It built pyramids and roads, conquered empires and connected continents. But success carried a hidden cost.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Egyptian temple complex, later period. HIGH PRIEST PSAMTIK meets with wealthy MERCHANT KHAEMWASET.</em></p>
<p><strong>MERCHANT KHAEMWASET:</strong> The new tax on grain traders seems... excessive.</p>
<p><strong>HIGH PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> The gods require proper offerings. Surely your profits can accommodate spiritual necessities?</p>
<p><strong>MERCHANT KHAEMWASET:</strong> <em>(slipping coins across the table)</em> Perhaps the gods might accept... alternative arrangements?</p>
<p><strong>HIGH PRIEST PSAMTIK:</strong> <em>(pocketing the coins)</em> The gods are sometimes... flexible in their requirements.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Later scene showing other merchants making similar arrangements.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> When all power flows through a single point, that point becomes valuable to influence. And influence, once purchased, becomes precedent. But more than that—centralization sends a signal to every predator within reach: here is where the real power lies. Here is what’s worth capturing.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: A broader view showing merchants, foreign ambassadors, and ambitious nobles all converging on the same temples and palaces, each seeking their own arrangements.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Egyptian priesthood didn’t just become corrupt—it became a magnet for corruption, drawing every ambitious schemer who understood that controlling the center meant controlling everything.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Roman imperial court, later Empire. SENATOR GAIUS MAXIMUS meets privately with PRAETORIAN PREFECT SEJANUS.</em></p>
<p><strong>GAIUS MAXIMUS:</strong> The Emperor’s new trade regulations harm my family’s business interests.</p>
<p><strong>SEJANUS:</strong> The Emperor’s wisdom is beyond question.</p>
<p><strong>GAIUS MAXIMUS:</strong> Of course. But surely his wisdom might be... guided... toward more beneficial interpretations?</p>
<p><em>Gaius slides a heavy purse across the table.</em></p>
<p><strong>SEJANUS:</strong> <em>(taking the purse)</em> Guidance is always welcome. For the good of the Empire, naturally.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Each small corruption seemed harmless—a favor here, an exception there. But precedents accumulate, and customs become morality.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Medieval European castle. KING EDWARD meets with GUILD MASTER ROBERT about trade regulations.</em></p>
<p><strong>GUILD MASTER ROBERT:</strong> Your Majesty, these new artisans threaten established order. They work outside guild regulations.</p>
<p><strong>KING EDWARD:</strong> Competition strengthens the realm through better goods at lower prices.</p>
<p><strong>GUILD MASTER ROBERT:</strong> But Majesty, consider the stability that guilds provide. The taxes they generate. The loyalty they ensure.</p>
<p><em>He produces an ornate chest filled with gold.</em></p>
<p><strong>GUILD MASTER ROBERT:</strong> Perhaps Your Majesty might see the wisdom of... protecting established interests?</p>
<p><strong>KING EDWARD:</strong> <em>(eyeing the gold)</em> Stability does have its merits.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Royal proclamation banning independent artisans.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O):</strong> The guilds claimed to protect quality and training. In reality, they eliminated competition while enriching both themselves and the officials they influenced.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Early American railroad office, 1880s. RAILROAD BARON JAY GOULD meets with CONGRESSMAN WILLIAM MCKINLEY.</em></p>
<p><strong>JAY GOULD:</strong> Congressman, these new railroad regulations will destroy American commerce.</p>
<p><strong>CONGRESSMAN MCKINLEY:</strong> The people demand fair rates and safe practices.</p>
<p><strong>JAY GOULD:</strong> The people demand prosperity. Which requires successful railroads. Which requires... understanding officials.</p>
<p><em>He slides stock certificates across the desk.</em></p>
<p><strong>JAY GOULD:</strong> Your wife might find railroad investments... profitable.</p>
<p><strong>CONGRESSMAN MCKINLEY:</strong> <em>(taking the certificates)</em> I’ve always believed in supporting American enterprise.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Congressional hearing where McKinley argues against railroad regulation.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> This was regulatory capture in its infancy—industries shaping the very regulations meant to control them. The fox wasn’t just guarding the henhouse; it was writing the rules for henhouse management. And every other fox in the forest was watching, learning, adapting the same techniques.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: A boardroom filled with representatives from different industries—oil, steel, banking, pharmaceuticals—sharing strategies for regulatory influence.</em></p>
<p><strong>OIL EXECUTIVE:</strong> Railroad methods work for any regulated industry. Identify key officials, provide them value, shape the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>STEEL EXECUTIVE:</strong> The beauty is, once you establish the precedent, it becomes normal business practice. Expected, even.</p>
<p><strong>BANKING EXECUTIVE:</strong> And the regulators genuinely believe they’re serving the public good. It’s not corruption if it’s policy.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Centralized power didn’t just enable predators—it taught them. Each successful capture became a template for the next, spreading the techniques across industries like a virus.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern pharmaceutical company boardroom, 1990s. PHARMA CEO RICHARD STONE meets with his regulatory team.</em></p>
<p><strong>RICHARD STONE:</strong> The FDA wants to expedite generic drug approvals. This threatens our profit margins.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY DIRECTOR:</strong> We could challenge the science, question their methodology—</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD STONE:</strong> Better. Let’s improve their methodology. Our research scientists could help design better testing protocols.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY DIRECTOR:</strong> Help them regulate us more effectively?</p>
<p><strong>RICHARD STONE:</strong> Help them regulate us more... appropriately.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Pharmaceutical scientists working inside FDA offices, officially “consulting” on regulatory standards.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> By the late 20th century, regulatory capture had evolved into something subtler and more complete. Industries didn’t just influence regulators—they educated them, trained them, even provided them.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: FDA conference room. AGENCY DIRECTOR MARGARET HAMBURG reviews new drug approval protocols written largely by industry scientists.</em></p>
<p><strong>FDA SCIENTIST DR. JAMES CARTER:</strong> These new protocols ensure rigorous safety testing.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTOR HAMBURG:</strong> Who developed these standards?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CARTER:</strong> A joint committee of agency and industry experts. The companies know their products best.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTOR HAMBURG:</strong> Any concerns about conflicts of interest?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CARTER:</strong> The companies want safe, effective drugs. Their interests align with ours.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same industry experts rejecting generic drug applications for “insufficient” testing.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The pharmaceutical industry didn’t need to corrupt the FDA—it had become the FDA. The regulators genuinely believed they were serving public health while systematically eliminating competition. And other industries watched this perfect capture with envy and admiration.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Cross-industry conference on “Public-Private Partnership Best Practices.” Executives from telecommunications, energy, defense, and agriculture compare notes.</em></p>
<p><strong>TELECOM EXECUTIVE:</strong> The pharmaceutical model is elegant. You don’t fight the regulators—you become them.</p>
<p><strong>ENERGY EXECUTIVE:</strong> Environmental agencies work the same way. Fund the research, train the scientists, define the standards.</p>
<p><strong>DEFENSE EXECUTIVE:</strong> Pentagon procurement follows identical patterns. Who better to write weapons specifications than weapons manufacturers?</p>
<p><strong>AGRICULTURE EXECUTIVE:</strong> FDA’s food safety protocols were largely industry-developed. Same playbook, different application.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The predator species had evolved. Modern regulatory capture wasn’t crude bribery—it was sophisticated ecosystem management, with each industry learning from the others’ successes.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Medical school classroom, 2000s. PROFESSOR SARAH KLEIN teaches pharmacology to future doctors.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR KLEIN:</strong> Today we’ll discuss the gold standard for clinical trials—randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.</p>
<p><strong>MEDICAL STUDENT:</strong> Professor, who established these standards?</p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR KLEIN:</strong> The scientific community, working with regulatory agencies and industry experts to ensure drug safety.</p>
<p><em>She doesn’t mention that the “scientific community” was largely funded by pharmaceutical companies.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The industry didn’t just capture regulators—it shaped the very definition of scientific rigor, wrote the curricula that trained researchers, funded the studies that determined “best practices.”</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Independent researcher DR. PETER GOTZSCHE tries to publish studies showing problems with industry-funded research.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. GOTZSCHE:</strong> <em>(to journal editor)</em> Our analysis shows systematic bias in industry-funded trials.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNAL EDITOR:</strong> Peter, this challenges established methodology. The peer reviewers—mostly industry-funded researchers—have concerns about your approach.</p>
<p><strong>DR. GOTZSCHE:</strong> But the data clearly shows—</p>
<p><strong>JOURNAL EDITOR:</strong> Data must be interpreted within accepted frameworks. Your framework isn’t... mainstream.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Gotzsche’s research being rejected by multiple journals.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Dissent wasn’t suppressed through force but through procedure. Alternative viewpoints weren’t banned—they simply didn’t meet “established standards” that the industry itself had established.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Congressional hearing, 2010s. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN questions FDA officials about drug pricing.</em></p>
<p><strong>SENATOR WARREN:</strong> Why do generic versions of essential drugs face such lengthy approval processes?</p>
<p><strong>FDA OFFICIAL DR. STEPHEN HAHN:</strong> Senator, we maintain the highest safety standards in the world.</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR WARREN:</strong> Standards written by the same companies that benefit from delayed competition?</p>
<p><strong>DR. HAHN:</strong> Our standards are developed through rigorous scientific consensus.</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR WARREN:</strong> Consensus among whom?</p>
<p><em>Dr. Hahn struggles to answer without mentioning industry involvement.</em></p>
<p><strong>SENATOR WARREN:</strong> I have another question for you, since you maintain the highest standards in the world and your impeccable standards are beyond reproach. If you’ve already established that a drug is fit for purpose then why does a generic formulation of exactly the same stuff need any test at all beyond purity?</p>
<p><strong>DR. HAHN:</strong> I, uh, it’s a matter of policy. We can’t allow exceptions, who knows where that might end?</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The officials weren’t lying—they genuinely believed in their standards. That was the ultimate achievement of regulatory capture: making the captured believe they were still free.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Red Square, Moscow, 1953. NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV addresses a massive crowd celebrating industrial achievements.</em></p>
<p><strong>KHRUSHCHEV:</strong> Comrades! Soviet central planning has achieved what capitalist chaos never could—rational coordination of an entire economy!</p>
<p><strong>CROWD:</strong> <em>(cheering)</em> Long live the Soviet Union!</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> If centralization was the path to strength, the Soviet Union represented its logical conclusion—every decision made by central authority, every resource allocated by central planning, every individual life coordinated by central command.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: GOSPLAN headquarters, 1960s. Soviet economic planners work with massive charts and calculators, attempting to coordinate the entire economy.</em></p>
<p><strong>CHIEF PLANNER LEONID KANTOROVICH:</strong> We must increase steel production by 15%, grain by 12%, and consumer goods by 8%.</p>
<p><strong>DEPUTY PLANNER:</strong> Comrade Kantorovich, the steel mills require more coal, but coal production depends on steel for mining equipment—</p>
<p><strong>KANTOROVICH:</strong> Then we adjust the algorithms. Central planning can solve any coordination problem with sufficient mathematical precision.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Factory floor where workers pretend to work while managers pretend to supervise.</em></p>
<p><strong>FACTORY WORKER:</strong> <em>(whispered)</em> They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> But perfect coordination required perfect information, and perfect information proved impossible when every level of the hierarchy had incentives to distort data.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Collective farm, 1970s. FARM MANAGER ALEXEI VOLKOV reports to REGIONAL PARTY SECRETARY.</em></p>
<p><strong>VOLKOV:</strong> Comrade Secretary, we’ve exceeded our grain quota by 20%!</p>
<p><strong>PARTY SECRETARY:</strong> Excellent! Moscow will be pleased.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same farm, where grain rots in fields due to lack of transport and storage.</em></p>
<p><strong>LOCAL FARMER:</strong> <em>(quietly to neighbor)</em> Half the harvest spoils before it reaches the cities, but Volkov reports record yields.</p>
<p><strong>NEIGHBOR:</strong> And if we tell the truth?</p>
<p><strong>LOCAL FARMER:</strong> Then we’re saboteurs who failed to meet the quota.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Each level of the hierarchy optimized for survival within the system rather than success of the system itself. Central planning became central pretending.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Politburo meeting, 1980s. MIKHAIL GORBACHEV reviews economic reports with growing concern.</em></p>
<p><strong>GORBACHEV:</strong> Our growth rates are declining. Our technology lags Western nations. How did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>ECONOMIC MINISTER NIKOLAI RYZHKOV:</strong> Comrade General Secretary, central planning ensures optimal resource allocation—</p>
<p><strong>GORBACHEV:</strong> Then why are our optimal allocations producing suboptimal results?</p>
<p><strong>RYZHKOV:</strong> Perhaps... perhaps we need more centralization? Better coordination mechanisms?</p>
<p><em>Gorbachev stares at the reports showing Soviet technology falling further behind.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The cure for centralization’s failures was always more centralization, until the system consumed so much energy coordinating itself that nothing remained for actual production.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Soviet computer research facility, 1980s. SOVIET PROGRAMMER ANDREI ERSHOV explains to visiting officials why Soviet computers lag behind American ones.</em></p>
<p><strong>ERSHOV:</strong> In America, thousands of independent programmers experiment with different approaches. Innovation emerges from chaos.</p>
<p><strong>VISITING OFFICIAL:</strong> But that’s wasteful! Uncoordinated! Surely central planning of research is more efficient?</p>
<p><strong>ERSHOV:</strong> Comrade, efficiency assumes you know the optimal path in advance. Innovation comes from discovering paths you didn’t know existed.</p>
<p><strong>VISITING OFFICIAL:</strong> The Party knows the optimal path for socialist development.</p>
<p><strong>ERSHOV:</strong> <em>(carefully)</em> Of course, Comrade. But perhaps... perhaps optimal paths in technology require different approaches?</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same research facility, years later, still using outdated equipment.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Central planning could optimize known processes but couldn’t innovate unknown solutions. The Soviet Union perfected the science of making obsolete products efficiently.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Berlin Wall falling, 1989. East Germans stream into West Berlin, amazed by the abundance of consumer goods.</em></p>
<p><strong>EAST GERMAN CITIZEN:</strong> <em>(staring at Western supermarket)</em> How do they coordinate all this without central planning?</p>
<p><strong>WEST GERMAN:</strong> They don’t coordinate it. It coordinates itself.</p>
<p><strong>EAST GERMAN CITIZEN:</strong> But that’s impossible! Without central authority, there would be chaos!</p>
<p><strong>WEST GERMAN:</strong> Look around. Do you see chaos?</p>
<p><em>The East German stares at the orderly abundance emerging from apparent disorder.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Soviet Union died not from external conquest but from internal contradiction. Perfect centralization proved perfectly brittle—unable to adapt, unable to innovate, unable to survive contact with systems that had learned to thrive without central control.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Final Soviet Politburo meeting, 1991. BORIS YELTSIN formally dissolves the USSR.</em></p>
<p><strong>YELTSIN:</strong> The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ceases to exist.</p>
<p><em>Camera lingers on the empty Kremlin offices, the abandoned central planning computers.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Seventy-four years of perfect centralization ended not with revolution but with exhaustion. The system simply stopped working, and no amount of central planning could plan its way back to functionality.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Modern Russia, where oligarchs and regional authorities operate with far less central coordination than the old Soviet system.</em></p>
<p><strong>RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN:</strong> <em>(to interviewer)</em> We learned that trying to control everything means controlling nothing. Now we control what matters and let the rest sort itself out.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Soviet collapse taught the world’s greatest lesson about centralization: it works until it doesn’t, and when it doesn’t, there’s nothing left to fall back on.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: University economics classroom, 1990s. PROFESSOR MILTON FRIEDMAN lectures to students about the Cold War’s end.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN:</strong> The victory of capitalism over communism proves the superiority of free market systems.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT:</strong> Professor, what exactly made capitalism superior?</p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN:</strong> Competition, private ownership, profit incentives—</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT:</strong> But wasn’t the real difference that America had thousands of independent decision-makers while the Soviet Union had one central planning committee?</p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR FRIEDMAN:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> Well... yes, but that’s because of private ownership—</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT:</strong> So if we had private ownership but all decisions were made centrally, would that still be capitalism?</p>
<p><em>The professor struggles with the implication.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The Cold War narrative obscured a crucial insight: the contest wasn’t between capitalism and communism, but between distributed and centralized decision-making.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Wall Street trading floor, 1990s. Thousands of traders make independent buying and selling decisions.</em></p>
<p><strong>TRADER 1:</strong> IBM reports better earnings—I’m buying!</p>
<p><strong>TRADER 2:</strong> Tech sector looks overvalued—I’m selling!</p>
<p><strong>TRADER 3:</strong> Interest rates are rising—shifting to bonds!</p>
<p><em>No central authority coordinates these decisions, yet the market processes information efficiently.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Capitalism’s strength wasn’t private ownership per se—it was that millions of independent actors could respond to local information without waiting for central approval.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Soviet-era factory, contrasted with American corporation of the same period.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Both had hierarchies, both had managers, both sought efficiency. But the Soviet factory waited for Moscow’s approval while the American factory’s middle management could adapt to local conditions.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern tech company, 2000s. STARTUP FOUNDER explains their organizational structure.</em></p>
<p><strong>STARTUP FOUNDER:</strong> We keep decision-making as decentralized as possible. Small teams, local autonomy, fast iteration.</p>
<p><strong>INVESTOR:</strong> That sounds chaotic. How do you maintain coordination?</p>
<p><strong>STARTUP FOUNDER:</strong> We coordinate around outcomes, not processes. Each team knows the goal—how they achieve it is up to them.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same company growing rapidly while more hierarchical competitors struggle to adapt.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The most successful capitalist enterprises learned the lesson that socialism never did: centralized coordination scales poorly, but decentralized coordination scales indefinitely.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Chinese economic reform meeting, 1980s. DENG XIAOPING explains market reforms to party officials.</em></p>
<p><strong>DENG XIAOPING:</strong> We will allow local managers to make production decisions without central approval.</p>
<p><strong>PARTY OFFICIAL:</strong> But Comrade Deng, that abandons central planning!</p>
<p><strong>DENG XIAOPING:</strong> No—it abandons central micromanagement. We plan the goals, they discover the methods.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Rapid Chinese economic growth following decentralization.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> China’s economic miracle began not when it abandoned communism, but when it abandoned centralized decision-making. The Communist Party remained in control—but stopped trying to control everything.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern Amazon warehouse, with thousands of workers coordinating through algorithms rather than human supervisors.</em></p>
<p><strong>WAREHOUSE MANAGER:</strong> Each worker receives optimized instructions based on real-time data. No central planner could coordinate this complexity.</p>
<p><strong>VISITING JOURNALIST:</strong> So who’s in charge?</p>
<p><strong>WAREHOUSE MANAGER:</strong> The system is in charge. Humans designed it, but it runs itself.</p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Twenty-first century capitalism discovered what Soviet planners never could: the most efficient coordination happens when no one is coordinating—when the system coordinates itself.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Corporate boardroom where executives realize they’re becoming the problem they once solved.</em></p>
<p><strong>CEO:</strong> Our approval processes are slowing innovation. Competitors move faster because they have fewer layers of management.</p>
<p><strong>CFO:</strong> But without central oversight, how do we maintain control?</p>
<p><strong>CEO:</strong> Maybe the question is: what do we actually need to control versus what we just want to control?</p>
<p><em>The executives stare at organizational charts showing byzantine approval processes.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The irony was perfect: successful capitalist enterprises could become as sclerotic as Soviet bureaucracies if they centralized too much decision-making in the name of coordination and control.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Small pharmaceutical startup trying to develop generic medications. STARTUP CEO MARIA SANTOS meets with regulatory consultant.</em></p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY CONSULTANT:</strong> Your generic formulation looks promising, but FDA approval will require studies costing fifty million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA SANTOS:</strong> Fifty million? The original drug approval cost a fraction of that.</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY CONSULTANT:</strong> Standards have evolved. For safety.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA SANTOS:</strong> Safety? Or to prevent competition?</p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY CONSULTANT:</strong> <em>(uncomfortable)</em> The two aren’t necessarily different.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The startup closing down, unable to afford regulatory compliance.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The system had achieved perfect efficiency—it eliminated competition not through prohibition but through process. The henhouse was safe, the farmers were protected, and the foxes were well-fed.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern university lecture hall. BUSINESS PROFESSOR WILLIAM LAZONICK addresses students.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR LAZONICK:</strong> This is how modern markets work—through regulatory frameworks that ensure consumer safety and market stability.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT:</strong> But Professor, doesn’t this prevent innovation? New companies can’t afford compliance costs.</p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR LAZONICK:</strong> Innovation happens within established companies that can bear regulatory costs. This ensures responsible development.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT:</strong> But what if established companies don’t want to innovate?</p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR LAZONICK:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> Market forces ensure they must.</p>
<p><em>But the student looks unconvinced.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Even academics taught the system’s logic as natural law. Centralization led to regulation, regulation led to capture, capture led to stagnation—but each step seemed reasonable, even necessary.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Final scene in Dr. Chen’s lecture hall from previous episodes.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(to her students)</em> We’ve seen the pattern across history—Egypt, Rome, China, Spain, Britain, America. Each centralized power to achieve great things. But centralization created a single point of influence. And influence, once purchased, becomes precedent.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT:</strong> So centralization is always bad?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Not always. But it’s always dangerous. The moment you create a center powerful enough to coordinate great achievements, you create a center valuable enough to corrupt.</p>
<p><em>She pauses, looking at her students.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The question isn’t whether centralization will be captured. The question is whether you’ll recognize the capture while there’s still time to choose a different path.</p>
<p><em>Final shot: A small community meeting where people make decisions face-to-face, no central authority, no distant regulators—just people working together.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Better centralization just burns the candle at both ends. The world searches for an honest fox to guard the henhouse, when the real answer is no fox at all. Perhaps the greatest strength isn’t the power to coordinate everything, but the wisdom to coordinate only what must be coordinated, leaving the rest to people who know their own needs better than any distant authority ever could.</p>
<h3 id="id-64">A Pattern Revealed</h3>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern university lecture hall. HISTORIAN DR. ELIZABETH CHEN addresses a packed auditorium. Behind her, a timeline shows the rise and fall of civilizations.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Egypt, Rome, China, Spain, Britain, America. Each rose higher than the last, each fell from greater heights. But now we can see what truly connected them all—centralization.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 1:</strong> But Professor, centralization made them powerful in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Exactly. That’s the trap. Centralization was their strength—until it became their weakness.</p>
<p><em>She clicks through images showing the progression: Egyptian pharaohs coordinating massive projects, Roman legions conquering through discipline, Chinese emperors building infrastructure, Spanish gold flowing through royal coffers, British Empire managed from Whitehall, American corporations coordinating global supply chains.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Each learned to concentrate power to achieve great things. But concentration creates a single point of failure—and a single point of influence. Not to mention attracting predators.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 1:</strong> Predators?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Think about it. If you’re a bad actor—corrupt merchant, ambitious warlord, greedy corporation—where do you focus your efforts? On influencing a thousand scattered decision-makers, or on capturing one centralized authority?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 2:</strong> So the corruption was inevitable?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Not corruption in the crude sense—bribery and theft. Corruption in the deeper sense—the gradual transformation of systems meant to serve people into systems that serve themselves.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 3:</strong> No, you were right! Two people working together are much more effective than a man alone. There’s a huge payoff, and the bigger yield encourages and supports growth, with better and better ROI, round and round in circles, bigger and better... up to a point. And then it doesn’t, but you’re committed!</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(a slow smile spreads across her face)</em> Exactly. You’ve just described the trap that caught every civilization in history. The sunk cost fallacy on a societal scale. Once you’ve built the pyramids, employed the bureaucrats, established the procedures, created the departments... the system becomes too big to abandon, even when it stops working. Especially when it stops working. Because admitting failure means admitting that all that investment, all that complexity, all that impressive centralization... was a mistake. <em>(pause)</em> And powerful people find that admission very, very difficult to make. </p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 2:</strong> Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Don’t stop there. Share your insight.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 2:</strong> It’s crystal meth for societies. It makes you better, smarter, faster, more stamina, a better you, so you want more and the doses get bigger and bigger and the payoff is less and less. And you’re a desperate junkie who can’t be reasoned with robbing everyone to support your habit. Until it kills you. </p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Will you be putting <em>that</em> in your paper?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 2:</strong> I...YES! It’s defensible. </p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> I salute the courage of your convictions. I look forward to working on it with you.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 1:</strong> But Professor, you mentioned predators earlier. Are we the addicts, or are we being fed the drugs by someone else?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(long pause)</em> That’s... perhaps the most important question you could ask. Are societies choosing centralization, or are they being pushed toward it by those who profit from concentrated power?</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 3:</strong> Like drug dealers targeting vulnerable populations?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Exactly. Every centralization creates opportunities for predators—and predators learn to encourage centralization. They become pushers of their own best product.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Modern scenes showing the same pattern—corporate boardrooms, government agencies, regulatory bodies.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The pattern persists because the incentives never change. Concentrate power, and those who benefit from that power will always find ways to capture and maintain it.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Corporate boardroom, modern day. EXECUTIVES discuss quarterly reports while ignoring long-term warnings.</em></p>
<p><strong>CEO:</strong> Our profits are up fifteen percent. Why change a winning strategy?</p>
<p><strong>INNOVATION DIRECTOR:</strong> Sir, our competitors are developing new technologies. We should invest in research—</p>
<p><strong>CEO:</strong> Research is expensive. Our current products dominate the market.</p>
<p><strong>CFO:</strong> Besides, we have regulatory approval, established supply chains, proven methods. Why risk disruption?</p>
<p><em>The innovation director looks frustrated but nods in compliance.</em></p>
<p><em>SCENE: Government committee room. OFFICIALS discuss policy while buried in procedure.</em></p>
<p><strong>COMMITTEE CHAIR:</strong> This proposal requires approval from six departments, three agencies, and two oversight boards.</p>
<p><strong>POLICY ANALYST:</strong> But sir, by the time we get all approvals, the problem we’re solving may have changed entirely.</p>
<p><strong>COMMITTEE CHAIR:</strong> Process exists for a reason. We cannot simply bypass established procedure.</p>
<p><strong>POLICY ANALYST:</strong> But what if the process has become the problem?</p>
<p><strong>COMMITTEE CHAIR:</strong> <em>(firm)</em> The process is not the problem. Compliance with the process is the solution.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Return to Dr. Chen’s lecture hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Egypt fell when its priests served ceremonies more than people. Rome fell when its citizens became subjects. China turned inward when exploration seemed too risky. Spain consumed wealth instead of creating it. Britain maintained an empire that no longer enriched them. America stopped learning when it decided it had nothing left to learn. All followed the same pattern—centralization, capture, corruption, collapse.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 3:</strong> But Professor, if centralization always leads to this, how do we organize complex societies?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> Perhaps that’s the wrong question. Perhaps we should ask— <em>(she stops, a distant look crossing her face)</em> You know, a man I knew in my youth loved to say ‘The best way to solve an intractable problem is to not have it in the first place.’ At the time I thought he was too lazy to work on hard problems, but now I’m not so sure. <em>(muttered under her breath)</em> God damn you, Forest, where are you now?</p>
<p><em>She shows images of small communities, local cooperatives, distributed networks.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The ancient world had small city-states that competed and innovated. When the Black Death temporarily broke the hold of centralists, it triggered a &mdash; it triggered <em>The</em> Renaissance. The modern world has open-source projects that outperform centralized corporations. The future might belong to networks of small, autonomous groups that coordinate by choice rather than command.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT 4:</strong> You’re saying we should abandon large organizations entirely?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> I’m saying we should make them justify their existence rather than assuming their necessity. Every centralization should carry the burden of proof—is this concentration of power truly needed, or is it just convenient for those who would wield it?</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Montage showing both centralized institutions in decline and small, innovative groups rising to fill the gaps.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Each civilization rose through innovation, adaptability, and the energy of people united in common cause. Each fell when those very successes calcified into systems that served the system more than the people who built it.</p>
<p><em>The camera focuses on individuals and small groups rather than institutions - a teacher with students, engineers collaborating across companies, farmers sharing techniques, parents raising children, neighbors helping neighbors.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> But if the pattern is as old as civilization itself, so too is the human capacity to recognize it, resist it, and choose a different path. The question that echoes across millennia remains: Will we serve our institutions, or will they serve us?</p>
<p><em>Final shot: Dawn breaking over a landscape where old, massive structures decay while new growth emerges—but this time, the new growth is distinctly different: small communities, individual makers, local cooperatives, distributed networks of people working together by choice rather than command.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The treadmill of civilizations continues, but perhaps we need not step onto it at all. Perhaps the next great leap is learning to achieve great things without concentrating great power. Perhaps the future belongs not to those who can command the most, but to those who can coordinate the least while accomplishing the most.</p>
<p><em>The camera pulls back to show a world where small autonomous groups work together in voluntary networks—no central command, no distant regulators, no foxes guarding henhouses.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> For in the end, civilizations don’t fall because they must. They fall because they choose the comfort of centralized control over the chaos of distributed freedom. The choice, as always, remains ours to make.</p>
<p><em>Fade to black. Final title card: “Choose wisely.”</em></p>

<p><em>FADE IN: The same opulent library. AUTUMN, in tweedy professor attire with leather elbow patches, methodically taps out her pipe against a crystal ashtray. The great brass-mounted globe spins slowly in the background, its companion Mars globe catching the light. She refills her pipe with deliberate academic ritual.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> We’ve seen the pattern - Egypt, Rome, China, Spain, Britain, America. Each rose through centralization, each fell to centralization’s inevitable capture. But we’ve told only half the story.</p>
<p><em>She strikes a match, lights the pipe with scholarly gravitas, an oversize match flame alternately vanishing into the bowl and flaring with a measured fffff-pu fffff-puh fffff-pu fffff-puh.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> The question that haunts history isn’t why civilizations fall. It’s why they take so long to die.</p>
<p><em>She spins the globe with one finger, stops it precisely, and taps her pipe stem on the Italian peninsula. The camera follows the pipe down, zooming and twisting as the scale shifts from global to human.</em></p>
<p><em>CUT TO: Rome, 476 CE. The “fall” of the Western Roman Empire. But the scene shows not collapse, but transformation - Roman officials simply changing titles, the same tax collection continuing under new names, the same roads being maintained by the same workers.</em></p>
<p><strong>HISTORIAN DR. MARCUS AURELIUS:</strong> <em>(voice over a medieval manuscript)</em> The Empire never truly fell. It simply... adapted. Changed its costume while keeping its essence.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Byzantine court, 800 CE. EMPEROR LEO V meets with administrators who could be Roman bureaucrats in different clothing.</em></p>
<p><strong>EMPEROR LEO:</strong> The Western provinces may be lost, but the Empire endures. We are still Rome.</p>
<p><strong>BYZANTINE ADMINISTRATOR:</strong> Indeed, Majesty. The forms change, but the center holds.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same administrative building, now flying different banners, serving different masters, but the bureaucratic machinery grinding on unchanged.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> This is the secret civilizations discovered: you don’t have to fall if you never truly rise. You can maintain the parasitic extraction without the visible empire. The substance without the form.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Medieval monastery. ABBOT BERNARD discusses taxes with LOCAL BARON.</em></p>
<p><strong>ABBOT BERNARD:</strong> The Church requires its tithes, my lord. God’s work cannot be done without proper resources.</p>
<p><strong>BARON WILLIAM:</strong> And the King requires his taxes. The realm must be defended.</p>
<p><strong>ABBOT BERNARD:</strong> Of course. The people exist to serve these higher purposes.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same peasants who once fed Roman legions now feeding Church coffers and royal treasuries. Different names, same extraction.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> Rome learned to survive its own death by distributing itself. Instead of one empire, a thousand smaller centralizations - each church, each lordship, each guild maintaining the essential pattern while avoiding the visibility that triggers resistance.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: 16th century European court. KING CHARLES V meets with GUILD MASTER JOHANN.</em></p>
<p><strong>GUILD MASTER JOHANN:</strong> Your Majesty, these independent artisans threaten the established order. Quality suffers when work is not properly overseen.</p>
<p><strong>KING CHARLES:</strong> And what oversight do you provide?</p>
<p><strong>GUILD MASTER JOHANN:</strong> We ensure standards, train apprentices, maintain the ancient ways. For a modest fee, naturally.</p>
<p><strong>KING CHARLES:</strong> <em>(smiling)</em> Naturally.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Guild halls that look remarkably like Roman administrative buildings, with the same complex hierarchies and fee structures.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> The genius of the post-Roman world wasn’t destroying centralization - it was franchising it. Every guild, every monastery, every noble court became a mini-Rome, extracting resources while providing just enough coordination to justify its existence.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: 18th century London. EAST INDIA COMPANY boardroom. DIRECTORS discuss colonial administration.</em></p>
<p><strong>DIRECTOR HASTINGS:</strong> Gentlemen, direct rule is expensive and obvious. Far better to work through local structures.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTOR CLIVE:</strong> Use their own hierarchies against them. More efficient, less resistance.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTOR HASTINGS:</strong> Precisely. Let them think they govern themselves while we control the mechanisms that matter.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Indian princes in their palaces, maintaining all the ceremony of rule while British officials control trade, taxation, and military decisions.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> This became the template - the illusion of local autonomy masking centralized control. Not conquest but capture, not occupation but influence.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: 19th century American robber baron’s mansion. RAILROAD BARON CORNELIUS VANDERBILT meets with STATE SENATOR WILLIAM MARCY.</em></p>
<p><strong>VANDERBILT:</strong> Senator, competition is wasteful. Multiple rail lines serve no one’s interests.</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR MARCY:</strong> The people demand choice, lower prices.</p>
<p><strong>VANDERBILT:</strong> The people demand reliable service. Which requires proper coordination. Perhaps the state might see the wisdom of... exclusive contracts?</p>
<p><em>Vanderbilt slides a leather portfolio across the mahogany table.</em></p>
<p><strong>SENATOR MARCY:</strong> <em>(opening the portfolio)</em> I’ve always believed in efficient governance.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Railroad monopolies that function exactly like Roman road systems - essential infrastructure used to control and extract from entire regions.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> By the 19th century, the pattern was perfected. Private centralization backed by state authority, each industry becoming its own little empire while claiming to serve “market efficiency” or “public good.”</p>
<p><em>SCENE: 1920s corporate boardroom. EXECUTIVES from different industries meet secretly.</em></p>
<p><strong>STEEL EXECUTIVE:</strong> Gentlemen, competition drives prices down and profits with them. </p>
<p><strong>OIL EXECUTIVE:</strong> But direct cartels invite government interference.</p>
<p><strong>BANKING EXECUTIVE:</strong> Then we don’t form cartels. We simply... coordinate standards. Share best practices. Ensure market stability.</p>
<p><strong>STEEL EXECUTIVE:</strong> Through trade associations, naturally.</p>
<p><strong>OIL EXECUTIVE:</strong> Professional organizations.</p>
<p><strong>BANKING EXECUTIVE:</strong> Educational foundations.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same executives later testifying to Congress about the benefits of “industry self-regulation.”</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> The 20th century’s innovation wasn’t new forms of centralization - it was making centralization invisible. Networks of influence that looked like independent organizations but functioned as a distributed empire.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: 1950s university economics department. PROFESSOR MILTON KEYNES lectures to students.</em></p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR KEYNES:</strong> The beauty of modern markets is their efficiency. Supply and demand, properly managed through institutional coordination, create optimal outcomes for all.</p>
<p><strong>STUDENT:</strong> But Professor, who determines what constitutes “proper management”?</p>
<p><strong>PROFESSOR KEYNES:</strong> <em>(pause)</em> Those best qualified to understand market dynamics, of course. Industry experts working with regulatory authorities.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same “industry experts” moving seamlessly between corporations, regulatory agencies, and academic positions.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> Academia became the legitimization engine - producing the theories that justified whatever the distributed empire needed justified. Not propaganda, but scholarship that happened to serve power.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Modern pharmaceutical company conference room. CEO RICHARD STONE addresses his board.</em></p>
<p><strong>CEO STONE:</strong> Gentlemen, we don’t control the market - we ARE the market. Our standards become industry standards. Our research becomes accepted science. Our needs become regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>BOARD MEMBER:</strong> And if someone challenges this system?</p>
<p><strong>CEO STONE:</strong> They find themselves challenging scientific consensus, regulatory expertise, and market reality simultaneously. Who would believe them over established institutions?</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Independent researchers struggling to publish studies that contradict industry-funded “consensus.”</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> The final evolution - capture so complete that the captured don’t realize they’re captured. The cage becomes invisible when it’s built from the prisoner’s own beliefs about how the world works.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Billionaire’s yacht, floating above the clouds. TECH BILLIONAIRE LARRY ELLISON speaks with his INVESTMENT ADVISOR.</em></p>
<p><strong>ELLISON:</strong> The foundation needs another twelve billion this quarter. Education reform, you understand.</p>
<p><strong>ADVISOR:</strong> Of course, sir. Which educational outcomes are we targeting?</p>
<p><strong>ELLISON:</strong> The ones that produce the kind of citizens we need. Compliant, trained, grateful for opportunities we provide.</p>
<p><strong>ADVISOR:</strong> And if local communities prefer different approaches?</p>
<p><strong>ELLISON:</strong> <em>(smiling)</em> They’re free to choose, naturally. As long as they choose correctly.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: School districts across the country adopting curricula designed by Ellison’s foundation, believing they’re implementing “cutting-edge pedagogy.”</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> By the 21st century, individual wealth accumulation had become its own form of civilization - self-perpetuating, self-justifying, divorced from any rational purpose.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Another billionaire’s private office. GEORGE SOROS meets with political operatives.</em></p>
<p><strong>SOROS:</strong> Democracy requires proper guidance. The people must be educated to vote correctly.</p>
<p><strong>OPERATIVE:</strong> And if they resist that education?</p>
<p><strong>SOROS:</strong> Then we help them understand their own best interests. Through proper media presentation, naturally.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: News organizations and activist groups funded by Soros presenting “grassroots” movements that happen to align perfectly with his political preferences.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> After the first half billion, there is nothing in the world they cannot buy, nowhere they cannot go, no experience they cannot have. Yet still they accumulate. Why?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: BILL GATES in his foundation headquarters, surrounded by charts showing global health initiatives.</em></p>
<p><strong>GATES:</strong> The data is clear - vaccination programs require centralized coordination to achieve optimal coverage.</p>
<p><strong>HEALTH MINISTER:</strong> But Mr. Gates, local communities sometimes prefer different approaches—</p>
<p><strong>GATES:</strong> Local communities lack the resources to properly analyze global epidemiological data. Trust the science.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same health minister implementing Gates Foundation protocols while believing he’s following “scientific consensus.”</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> They had become their own micro-civilizations, complete with the same centralization, capture, and corruption patterns that toppled empires. Individual dynasties operating with the resources of small nations, accountable to no one.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: SpaceX facility. ELON MUSK examines rocket designs with his engineering team.</em></p>
<p><strong>MUSK:</strong> Mars colonization requires massive resource concentration. We need redundant life support, sustainable manufacturing, enough genetic diversity for a viable population.</p>
<p><strong>ENGINEER:</strong> The costs are astronomical, sir. Literally.</p>
<p><strong>MUSK:</strong> That’s why we need this level of resource concentration. No government would sustain this investment long enough. No committee would take these risks.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Successful rocket launches, Mars rovers, the infrastructure for interplanetary civilization.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> One outlier found something that actually required concentrated wealth at this scale - ensuring human survival beyond Earth. But he was the exception that proved the rule.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Return to the library. Autumn sets down her pipe, smoke curling from her barely-visible far ear.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> Which raises uncomfortable questions. Is it worth tolerating the damage inflicted by Ellison, Soros, Gates, and their peers in the hope that occasionally, someone like Musk emerges?</p>
<p><em>She spins the terrestrial globe. As it turns, the blues and greens shift to rust-red, the familiar continents morphing into Martian craters and canyons, slowing to reveal the Red Planet.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> And even if Musk succeeds - is it wise to have humanity’s entire off-world future as the property of a single eccentric with absolute power? However benevolent his intentions?</p>
<p><em>The camera pulls back to show both Earth and Mars globes.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> If massive resource concentration is truly necessary for civilization-scale projects, surely there must be ways to achieve it without creating permanent dynasties of unaccountable power. Ways to concentrate resources temporarily for specific purposes, then disperse them again before capture occurs.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Congressional hearing room, 2020s. SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN questions FDA DIRECTOR.</em></p>
<p><strong>SENATOR WARREN:</strong> Dr. Hahn, why do generic drug approvals take so long and cost so much?</p>
<p><strong>FDA DIRECTOR HAHN:</strong> Senator, we maintain the highest safety standards in the world. These standards were developed through rigorous scientific consensus.</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR WARREN:</strong> Consensus among whom?</p>
<p><strong>FDA DIRECTOR HAHN:</strong> Leading researchers, industry experts, regulatory professionals - the people most qualified to understand these complex issues.</p>
<p><strong>SENATOR WARREN:</strong> The same people who benefit from making generic approvals expensive and difficult?</p>
<p><strong>FDA DIRECTOR HAHN:</strong> <em>(long pause)</em> Senator, I resent the implication that dedicated public servants would compromise patient safety for corporate interests.</p>
<p><strong>RFK JR.:</strong> <em>(voice from off-camera)</em> I resent the fact that it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>TRUMP:</strong> <em>(voice from off-camera)</em> Yer fired!</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The Director genuinely believing his own words while implementing policies written by industry consultants.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> This is how empires learned to survive their own deaths - by becoming invisible, distributed, and self-justifying. Not one Rome but ten thousand micro-Romes, each extracting from its domain while claiming to serve higher purposes.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Return to the library. Autumn sets down her pipe, looking directly at the camera.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> But what if the pattern could be broken? What if, instead of waiting for collapse and replacement, human organization could undergo genuine metamorphosis?</p>
<p><em>She spins the globe again, but this time it stops on a blank area - no countries marked, just geography.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> Metamorphosis requires dissolution. The caterpillar must become soup before it becomes butterfly. Every cell of the old structure must release its grip before the new form can emerge.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Small community meeting. People sit in a circle with no central authority, no podium, no hierarchy. Decisions emerge through discussion rather than decree.</em></p>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY MEMBER SARAH:</strong> The dam’s leaking. What are we going to do about it?</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY MEMBER JAMES:</strong> I’ve got time, but I don’t know much about dams.</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY MEMBER BILL:</strong> If you and your four thousand kids can help me get the harvest in I can teach you what you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>COMMUNITY MEMBER SARAH:</strong> You’d better bloody hurry. The rainy season is almost over. Dam first. </p>
<p><em>Hands raise. No applications, no bureaucracy, no capture.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> This is what post-civilizational organization looks like - voluntary coordination without permanent hierarchy, functional cooperation without institutional capture.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: The same community defending itself efficiently against external threats, then immediately dissolving the command structure when the threat passes.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> They’ve learned civilization’s lessons without keeping civilization’s chains. They can coordinate complex activities, maintain high technology, even defend against organized enemies - but they do it through temporary structures that can’t be captured because they don’t persist long enough.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Network of such communities sharing resources and information through voluntary connections rather than centralized systems.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> The butterfly doesn’t replace the caterpillar - it uses everything the caterpillar built while abandoning everything that made the caterpillar a caterpillar.</p>
<p><em>Final scene: Autumn in the library, pipe smoke curling around the slowly spinning globes.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> The old ways got us this far, but now they weigh us down. They bootstrapped technology, accumulated knowledge, connected distant peoples. But entropy turns every solution into tomorrow’s problem - the very mechanisms that once enabled growth now constrain it. Like a ship that’s accumulated so much barnacle-weight it can no longer make headway, we must scrape clean before we can sail forward.</p>
<p><em>She taps her pipe against the crystal ashtray.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> The question isn’t whether the current system will fall - all centralized systems eventually collapse under their own contradictions. The question is whether anything better will be ready to emerge from the dissolution.</p>
<p><em>The camera slowly pulls back from the library, showing it situated in an impossible space - not quite earth, not quite anywhere else.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> Metamorphosis is never voluntary. The caterpillar doesn’t choose to become soup. But sometimes, if conditions are right, something beautiful can emerge from the dissolution of something that was once necessary but is necessary no longer.</p>
<p><em>The globe stops spinning. The library fades to black.</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTUMN (as NARRATOR):</strong> The choice, as always, is what form that emergence takes.</p>
<p><em>FADE TO BLACK.</em></p>

<p><em>FADE IN: University lecture hall. DR. CHEN stands before a large whiteboard covered with interconnected diagrams showing the rise and fall patterns of Egypt, Rome, China, and other civilizations.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> So we’ve seen the pattern repeated across millennia and continents. Egypt, Rome, China, Spain, Britain—different cultures, different eras, but the same fundamental trajectory. <em>(gestures to diagrams)</em> Success breeds centralisation, centralisation enables separation of benefit from consequence, and that separation eventually destroys the strategic capabilities that created the success in the first place.</p>
<p><em>She draws connecting lines between the civilization diagrams.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> But here’s the question that should keep us awake at night: Is this pattern inevitable? Are all complex societies doomed to this cycle of rise and collapse? Or is there a way to develop sophisticated technology and coordinate large-scale activities without falling into this trap?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Montage of modern technology - satellites, internet infrastructure, global supply chains, medical equipment.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The stakes have never been higher. Modern civilization depends on technologies that require massive coordination and resources. But every solution we’ve tried—government agencies, multinational corporations, international bodies—seems to recreate the same deadly patterns our predecessors discovered.</p>
<p><em>Cut back to lecture hall. Students are taking notes intently.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Professor, you’re making it sound like there’s no solution. Like we’re destined to repeat the same mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> I’m making it sound like the solutions we’ve been trying—more centralisation, more bureaucracy, more separation—are exactly backwards. <em>(pause)</em> But what if the real solution isn’t more complex institutions, but better-designed institutions?</p>
<p><em>She turns to a fresh section of whiteboard.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Let’s start with first principles. What do we actually need from a technological civilization?</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> Innovation. The ability to develop new solutions to problems.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> Coordination. Getting people to work together on complex projects.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Resource allocation. Making sure materials and expertise get where they’re needed.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Excellent. Now, what do we need to avoid?</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> The separation problem. Decision-makers who don’t face the consequences of their decisions.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> Institutional capture. Bureaucracies that optimise for their own survival instead of their stated purpose.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> Innovation death. When success leads to risk aversion and technological stagnation.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(writing on board)</em> So we need: Innovation, Coordination, Resource Allocation. We need to avoid: Separation, Capture, Stagnation. The question is: can we design systems that deliver the benefits without the pathologies?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Animation showing traditional hierarchical organization charts morphing into network diagrams.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The answer lies not in avoiding organisation, but in changing how we organise. Instead of centralised hierarchies that concentrate power, we need distributed networks that preserve accountability.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Modern examples - open source software development, showing programmers around the world collaborating on complex projects.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(V.O.)</em> Consider Linux. Thousands of developers, coordinating on one of the most complex software projects in history. No central authority dictating terms, no bureaucracy allocating resources, no separation between those who make decisions and those who live with the consequences.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Interview with LINUS TORVALDS, creator of Linux.</em></p>
<p><strong>LINUS TORVALDS:</strong> The key is that anyone can propose changes, but those changes get reviewed by people who actually use the code. Bad ideas get rejected not by committee, but by reality. If your code doesn’t work, people don’t use it.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> But how do you coordinate such a massive project without central management?</p>
<p><strong>LINUS TORVALDS:</strong> You don’t coordinate it. You make coordination unnecessary. Each part of the system is designed to work independently, so people can contribute without requiring permission from anyone else.</p>
<p><em>Cut back to lecture hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Notice what’s happening there. High technology, global coordination, continuous innovation—but no centralisation, no separation of consequence from decision-making, no bureaucratic capture.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> But that’s just software. What about physical infrastructure? You can’t build bridges or power plants through distributed networks.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Can’t you? <em>(turns to board)</em> Let’s think about what actually made those historical civilizations vulnerable.</p>
<p><em>She draws a diagram showing centralised vs. distributed infrastructure.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Egyptian irrigation depended on centralised management of the Nile. Roman roads required imperial maintenance. Chinese treasure fleets needed imperial shipyards. In each case, a single point of control became a single point of failure.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> So you’re saying we should avoid large-scale infrastructure projects?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> I’m saying we should design them differently. <em>(pointing to distributed network diagram)</em> What if instead of one massive power grid, we had thousands of smaller, interconnected microgrids? Instead of centralised manufacturing, distributed fabrication? Instead of imperial fleets, networks of independent operators?</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Animation showing resilient network topologies—multiple pathways, no single points of failure.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The mathematics of network resilience suggests that distributed systems with multiple pathways are not just more robust than centralised systems—they’re more effective. No single point of failure means no catastrophic collapse. No central bottleneck means faster adaptation to changing conditions. And in many cases, they’re also more efficient—distributed power generation requires far less grid infrastructure than centralised plants feeding distant consumers.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Example of decentralised power grid in Germany, showing solar panels on individual buildings feeding into local networks.</em></p>
<p><strong>GRID ENGINEER SCHMIDT:</strong> Each building can generate power, store power, or consume power based on immediate conditions. The system balances itself automatically, without requiring central dispatch or bureaucratic approval.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> What happens when demand exceeds local supply?</p>
<p><strong>GRID ENGINEER SCHMIDT:</strong> Power flows from areas with surplus to areas with deficit, following the laws of physics rather than administrative procedure. It’s like water finding its level—automatic, efficient, and impossible to game or capture.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> But surely someone needs to control and profit from this system?</p>
<p><strong>GRID ENGINEER SCHMIDT:</strong> <em>(laughing)</em> That’s the beauty of it—and the reason why centralized utilities fight it so hard. There’s nowhere to put the tollbooths. Just like the early internet, distributed systems resist the kind of chokepoint control that traditional business models depend on.</p>
<p><em>Back to lecture hall. Students are looking thoughtful.</em></p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> That sounds great in theory, but what about quality control? What about standards? Don’t you need some kind of central authority to make sure everything works together?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(smiling)</em> That’s exactly the question the Chinese court asked about maritime exploration. “How can we ensure proper behavior without central control?” But standards don’t require central enforcement. They emerge from the need for interoperability.</p>
<p><em>She points to examples on the board.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The internet is the most complex technological system in history, but it has no central government. TCP/IP protocols emerged because systems that couldn’t communicate with each other were less useful than systems that could. USB connectors became standard because manufacturers discovered customers preferred devices that worked together.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> But what about coordination for really big projects? Space exploration, medical research, climate infrastructure?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(pause, considering)</em> That’s where it gets interesting. Look at how SpaceX changed space exploration—not by creating a bigger NASA, but by creating competition for NASA. Look at how the Human Genome Project succeeded—not through one massive government program, but through competing teams sharing data while racing to decode different sections.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Montage showing modern distributed research—labs around the world sharing data, competing companies pushing each other to innovate, open-source hardware projects.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The pattern that emerges is clear: centralisation for coordination, but distribution for implementation. Standards for interoperability, but autonomy for innovation. Cooperation for shared goals, but competition for better solutions.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Interview with genomics researcher DR. HELEN WANG.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. WANG:</strong> The Human Genome Project worked because teams competed while sharing fundamental discoveries. Each lab focused on different chromosomes, but when someone found a breakthrough technique, it spread rapidly. We got the complete sequence years ahead of schedule with multiple verification pathways. No single point of failure.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> But didn’t that create duplication of effort? Wasn’t it wasteful?</p>
<p><strong>DR. WANG:</strong> Only if you assume that bureaucratic resource allocation is more efficient than distributed expertise. But the evidence suggests the opposite. Multiple parallel approaches with shared standards gave us both speed and accuracy that no centralized program could match.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> What about counter-examples? Cases where centralized control supposedly worked better?</p>
<p><strong>DR. WANG:</strong> <em>(grimly)</em> Look at mRNA vaccine development during COVID. Centralized regulatory agencies, emergency powers bypassing normal checks, guaranteed profits with zero liability for manufacturers. That’s not distributed innovation—that’s regulatory capture. Corporations got the benefits, the public bore the risks, and we’re still discovering the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> You sound like you’re thinking of something specific.</p>
<p><strong>DR. WANG:</strong> <em>(pauses, then sighs)</em> Well, there’s the SV40 contamination issue, the cardiac effects in young people, the complete lack of long-term safety data, the suppression of early treatment alternatives that might have made the whole program unnecessary... <em>(catches herself)</em> But honestly, discussing this in detail isn’t exactly a great career move for someone who still needs research funding.</p>
<p><em>Back to lecture hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> So we have examples of technological systems that avoid the historical pattern. But what about governance? What about social organisation? Can entire societies organise this way?</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> That seems impossible. You need laws, enforcement, courts, military...</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Do you? <em>(walks to a new section of board)</em> Let’s examine what those institutions actually do, and whether there are alternative ways to achieve the same outcomes.</p>
<p><em>She writes: “Functions of Government” on the board.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Defense, dispute resolution, resource allocation, standard-setting, infrastructure coordination. These are legitimate needs. The question is whether centralized monopolistic institutions are the only way—or even the best way—to address them.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> <em>(looking up from his notes)</em> Professor, did you just say “legitimate needs”? Legitimate according to whom? Isn’t that exactly the kind of thinking you’ve been warning us about—accepting that something is necessary just because authority says it is?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(pausing, then smiling ruefully)</em> Warren, you just caught me falling into the very trap I’ve been describing. You’re absolutely right. I should have said “real needs”—things that human societies actually require to function, not things that governments declare necessary to justify their existence.</p>
<p><em>She erases “legitimate” and writes “real” on the board.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Thank you. That’s exactly the kind of critical thinking that makes distributed systems work—questioning authority even when it comes from your professor.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Historical example - medieval Iceland’s Althing, showing decentralized legal system.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> For three centuries, medieval Iceland operated without a central government. Disputes were resolved through competing law-speaker networks, defense was organized through voluntary associations, and infrastructure was maintained through local cooperation. The system produced higher literacy rates and more technological innovation than contemporary European kingdoms.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Modern example - Switzerland’s cantonal system.</em></p>
<p><strong>SWISS POLITICAL SCIENTIST DR. ANNA WEBER:</strong> Swiss cantons compete to attract residents and businesses by providing better services at lower costs. If a canton becomes too bureaucratic or inefficient, people leave. This creates accountability that centralized systems lack.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> But what about national defense? Global coordination?</p>
<p><strong>DR. WEBER:</strong> Cantons cooperate when they share interests and compete when they don’t. For defense, they coordinate because an attack on one threatens all. For local services, they compete because better solutions attract more residents. It’s the best of both worlds.</p>
<p><em>Back to lecture hall. Students are looking intrigued but skeptical.</em></p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> Professor, this all sounds very theoretical. But in practice, don’t distributed systems just lead to chaos? Don’t you need someone in charge?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(leaning against the board)</em> That question reveals our deepest assumption—that organization requires an organizer, that coordination requires a coordinator. But some of the most organized systems in nature have no central authority.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Animation of flocking birds, schooling fish, swarming bees.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Flocks of starlings perform aerial maneuvers that would challenge the best air show pilots, yet no bird is giving orders. Fish schools navigate obstacles and avoid predators with precision that military formations envy, yet no fish commands the school. The coordination emerges from simple local rules, not central planning.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Research lab studying swarm intelligence.</em></p>
<p><strong>SWARM RESEARCHER DR. CRAIG REYNOLDS:</strong> Each individual follows a few basic rules—maintain distance from neighbors, match their velocity, move toward the center of nearby individuals. From these simple local interactions, complex global behaviors emerge. No leadership required.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Could human societies work the same way?</p>
<p><strong>DR. REYNOLDS:</strong> They already do, in many contexts. Markets coordinate the production and distribution of millions of products without central planning. Cities organise themselves without urban dictators. Languages evolve and spread without linguistic authorities. Most of human coordination happens through emergent processes, not hierarchical control.</p>
<p><em>Back to lecture hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The question isn’t whether distributed systems can work—they’re working all around us. The question is whether we can design our formal institutions to harness these natural coordination mechanisms instead of fighting them.</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> But what about accountability? In a distributed system, who’s responsible when things go wrong?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(pausing thoughtfully)</em> That’s perhaps the most important question. In centralized systems, responsibility is supposed to flow upward, but it gets diffused through bureaucratic layers. In practice, no one is truly accountable because everyone can blame the system.</p>
<p><em>She draws accountability flows on the board.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> In distributed systems, accountability is direct and immediate. If a Linux developer writes bad code, other developers reject it immediately. If a company provides poor service, customers switch to competitors immediately. If a canton implements bad policies, residents vote with their feet immediately.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> But what about problems that require long-term thinking? Climate change, infrastructure maintenance, education? Immediate feedback doesn’t help with those.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Excellent point. That’s where we need to distinguish between operational decisions and strategic ones. For operations—how to do things—distributed systems excel. For strategy—what to do—we need different mechanisms.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Example of long-term strategic planning in distributed system - research universities.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Universities demonstrate one model for strategic coordination without centralization. Each institution operates independently, but they share information, compete for students and faculty, and collaborate on research. The system produces both short-term innovation and long-term knowledge accumulation.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Interview with UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT DR. SARAH MARTINEZ.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. MARTINEZ:</strong> We plan decades ahead for research programs and infrastructure, but we don’t need a central authority to coordinate that planning. Universities that plan poorly lose faculty and students to universities that plan better. Market forces create accountability for long-term decisions.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> But what about problems that affect everyone? Climate change, pandemics, resource depletion?</p>
<p><strong>DR. MARTINEZ:</strong> Those require cooperation, but not necessarily centralization. The Montreal Protocol eliminated ozone-depleting chemicals through international agreements between sovereign nations, not through world government. When everyone benefits from solving a problem, they’ll cooperate to solve it.</p>
<p><em>Back to lecture hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> <em>(interrupting with obvious skepticism)</em> Professor, with all due respect, universities competing for better long-term planning? The math, the science and the fundamental engineering never changes. But universities are always fighting the last war anyway. They’re still preparing students for the economy that existed when the curriculum was written, not the one that’ll exist when we graduate. <em>(voice becoming more bitter)</em> And let’s be honest—we don’t come here to learn, we come here for an entry ticket for a pay-to-play game. Even moreso the med students.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(pausing, then nodding)</em> Warren, that’s actually a perfect example of why distributed systems work better than centralised ones. You’re absolutely right that universities often lag behind reality—they’re optimising for bureaucratic approval rather than practical outcomes. <em>(a distant look crosses her face)</em> You know, that reminds me of someone. He cherry-picked subjects across disciplines—metallurgy, electronics, botany, psychology—whatever he thought would be enabling. He drove them crazy, and he never did get a degree, he was far too busy learning. He loved solving the impossible problems and leaving a proof of concept for others to finish. <em>(a slight smile)</em> He used to say “I’m too lazy to do this badly.” I thought he <em>was</em> lazy but maybe he was teaching.</p>
<p><em>She pauses, then refocuses on the present.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> But notice what happens when alternatives emerge.</p>
<p><em>She points to examples on the board.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Coding bootcamps emerged because computer science departments weren’t producing job-ready programmers. Online courses proliferated because traditional lectures weren’t effective for many learning styles. Professional certifications gained value because degrees weren’t reliable signals of competence. The system corrects itself, but only when alternatives are allowed to compete.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> So distributed systems work because they let the dinosaurs die off naturally?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(smiling)</em> Exactly. Instead of trying to reform institutions that have no incentive to change, you create new institutions that serve people better. The old ones can keep doing what they’re doing until they become irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> So we have models for distributed systems that handle innovation, coordination, resource allocation, accountability, and even long-term strategic planning. The question is: what would a entire civilization look like if it were built on these principles from the ground up?</p>
<p><em>She turns to a fresh section of board and begins sketching a diagram.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Imagine a society where most services are provided by competing private organizations, but critical infrastructure operates as open-source utilities. Where defense is organized through voluntary mutual-aid networks, but weapons technology is developed through competitive research. Where standards emerge through market forces, but information is shared openly.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Speculative animation showing such a society—diverse organizations cooperating and competing, no central government but extensive voluntary coordination.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> Such a society would face new challenges, but they would be different challenges from the ones that destroyed historical civilisations. Instead of centralisation leading to capture and stagnation, distributed power would create resilience and continuous adaptation.</p>
<p><em>Cut back to lecture hall. Students are taking detailed notes.</em></p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> Professor, this sounds like anarcho-capitalism or something. Isn’t that just another ideology?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(laughing)</em> Fair question. But notice what I’m not advocating. I’m not saying eliminate all institutions—I’m saying design them differently. I’m not saying eliminate all coordination—I’m saying coordinate through networks rather than hierarchies. I’m not saying eliminate all standards—I’m saying let them emerge from practice rather than bureaucratic decree.</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> But how do you transition from centralized systems to distributed ones? You can’t just flip a switch.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> No, but you can start at the margins and work inward. Open-source software didn’t replace proprietary software overnight—it started in specialized applications and proved its value before expanding. Distributed power grids are starting in rural areas and proving their resilience before urban adoption.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Examples of distributed systems expanding - cryptocurrency networks, mesh networking, local food systems.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The transition is already happening in sectors where centralized systems have failed most obviously. Where bureaucracy has created more problems than it solved, alternatives are emerging organically.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Real-world example - mesh networks in disaster areas.</em></p>
<p><strong>MESH NETWORK ENGINEER SARAH KIM:</strong> When Hurricane Katrina knocked out centralized communications, ham radio operators and mesh networks provided the only reliable information flow. Now we’re building permanent mesh infrastructure that can route around damage automatically.</p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> How does it work without central control?</p>
<p><strong>SARAH KIM:</strong> Each node forwards messages toward their destination using whatever path is available. If one route fails, the network finds another automatically. It’s more robust than any centralized system could be, because it doesn’t have single points of failure.</p>
<p><em>Back to lecture hall for final discussion.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The historical pattern is clear: centralisation plus separation of benefit from consequence equals civilisational collapse. But the pattern isn’t inevitable. We can design systems that deliver the benefits of coordination without the pathologies of centralisation.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> So you’re saying we can get off the treadmill?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> I’m saying the treadmill isn’t the only exercise equipment. <em>(gestures to board covered with alternative models)</em> Networks, markets, voluntary associations, competitive cooperation—these are technologies for human coordination that don’t require surrendering our autonomy to distant bureaucrats.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> But what about the transition period? What happens to people who depend on current centralized systems?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The same thing that happened when agriculture replaced hunting, when industry replaced agriculture, when information replaced industry. Some jobs disappear, new jobs appear, and most people adapt. The question is whether we manage the transition intelligently or stumble through it blindly.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> But Professor, what’s the real incentive? Why would people choose distributed systems over centralized ones that promise security and wealth?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(pausing thoughtfully)</em> That’s the key question, isn’t it? What do people actually want when they say they want money? <em>(walks to board)</em> Security, autonomy, capability, respect. But money only delivers these things as long as the monetary system itself remains stable and fair.</p>
<p><em>She draws two columns on the board: “Money Promises” and “Distributed Systems Deliver”</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> When the monetary system becomes captured—when central banks serve political interests, when currencies inflate, when access gets restricted—suddenly your money doesn’t buy security or autonomy. It buys dependency on the institutions that control it.</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> So you’re saying distributed systems offer what money promises but can’t always deliver?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Exactly. Direct capabilities—skills, relationships, local resources, knowledge—these don’t disappear when institutions fail. They’re not subject to devaluation by central authorities. They represent actual value, not claims on value that someone else controls.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> But Professor, won’t the people who benefit from centralized systems fight back? They’re not going to just let their power be distributed away.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(grimly)</em> Oh, they absolutely will. And they’ll be very clever about it. <em>(turns to board)</em> They won’t oppose distributed systems directly—that would be too obvious. Instead, they’ll propose “reforming” centralization by making it even more centralized.</p>
<p><em>She writes an example on the board.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> “We have a coordination problem between agencies. The solution? Create a new super-agency to coordinate all the other agencies.” Of course, this requires keeping all the existing bureaucrats plus hiring five hundred more to run the coordination department.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Brief excerpt from “Yes Minister” - SIR HUMPHREY APPLEBY explaining departmental mergers.</em></p>
<p><strong>SIR HUMPHREY:</strong> <em>(on screen)</em> The merger will require careful coordination between the existing departments, Minister. We’ll need to retain all current staff to maintain institutional knowledge, plus a substantial coordination team to ensure proper integration. I estimate we’ll need at least five hundred additional personnel.</p>
<p><strong>MINISTER HACKER:</strong> But isn’t the point of a merger to eliminate redundancy?</p>
<p><strong>SIR HUMPHREY:</strong> Oh yes, Minister. We’re eliminating the redundancy of having departments that don’t coordinate properly. Very inefficient.</p>
<p><em>Back to lecture hall.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The parasites don’t oppose the host—they propose making the host bigger and more nutritious. Every crisis becomes justification for more centralization, more coordination, more “efficiency.”</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> It’s not just bureaucrats, is it? What about all the corporations that profit from centralized systems?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(nodding)</em> Exactly. Utility companies fighting distributed power generation. Tech platforms resisting mesh networks. Banks opposing cryptocurrency. Media conglomerates battling decentralized content creation. They don’t want to lose their tollbooths.</p>
<p><em>She draws a diagram showing corporate chokepoints.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Every centralized system creates rentier opportunities—places where you can extract value without adding it. These companies have massive lobbying budgets and regulatory capture to protect their tollbooths. They’ll fund studies proving distributed systems are “unsafe” or “inefficient” or “need oversight.”</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> So how do you get around that resistance?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The same way distributed systems always emerge—by making centralized resistance irrelevant. You don’t fight the old system, you build new systems that make the old ones obsolete. The recording industry didn’t choose to be disrupted by file sharing and streaming. Taxi companies didn’t vote for ride-sharing. Hotel chains didn’t approve Airbnb.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> But surely when you explain the historical pattern to these people—the bureaucrats and corporate executives—they understand the long-term consequences?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(with a bitter smile)</em> Oh, they understand perfectly. I’ve presented this analysis to government panels and corporate boards. They nod, they take notes, they ask intelligent questions. They see exactly how centralization leads to capture and collapse.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> And then what happens?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Then they go back to their offices and continue doing exactly what they were doing before. Because here’s the beautiful part—<em>(she points to her diagrams)</em>—they’ll be away with the gold before the walls come down. The bureaucrat gets his pension, the executive gets his golden parachute, the politician gets his post-office consulting contracts.</p>
<p><em>She draws a timeline on the board showing personal benefit vs. systemic collapse.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The separation of benefit from consequence isn’t just built into the system—it’s built into the people who run the system. They understand the problem perfectly, but it’s not <em>their</em> problem. The costs will be paid by their successors, by other departments, by future generations. Meanwhile, the benefits flow to them, right now.</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> So they become willing participants in civilizational suicide?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> They become rational actors within an irrational system. The system rewards them for decisions that destroy the system, so that’s what they optimise for. It’s the separation problem in its purest form—perfect knowledge, perfect incentives to ignore that knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> <em>(voice breaking slightly)</em> So we’re... we’re just doomed, aren’t we? The people who could save us are the same people who are destroying us, and they know it, and they don’t care because they’ll be dead before the consequences hit.</p>
<p><em>Long, heavy silence in the lecture hall. Several students look genuinely shaken.</em></p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> <em>(continuing, more quietly)</em> How do you fight that? How do you fight people who understand exactly what they’re doing and choose to do it anyway because the system rewards them for it?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(gently)</em> Jason, that despair you’re feeling? That’s the moment you stop being part of the problem. Because now you understand why reform doesn’t work, why voting harder doesn’t work, why writing letters to your representatives doesn’t work.</p>
<p><em>She pauses, looking directly at him.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The sentence in your head is “Nobody cares, who will save me from this?” but the people who can save you look at you out of the bathroom mirror every day. Not the bureaucrats, not the politicians, not the corporate executives. You. And everyone else who chooses to build something better instead of waiting for permission from the people who profit from keeping things broken. You were wrong: nobody <em>else</em> cares. Whose responsibility is your life, Jason? The rest of you?</p>
<p><em>She walks to the board and draws two simple figures.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> This is a bit grim, so let’s use pop culture as an illustration. What happens in a Superman movie? The TL;DR that covers them all: people wait helplessly for external salvation. Superman swoops in, saves everyone, flies away. The system stays exactly the same because nobody had to change, nobody had to grow, nobody had to take responsibility.</p>
<p><em>She draws another figure.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Now consider Tony Stark. Billionaire, womanizing asshole extraordinaire. Yet somehow he’s infinitely more relatable than the boy scout in the cape. Why? Because when the chips were down and all that money couldn’t help him, he didn’t wait for rescue. He saved himself with ingenuity and whatever was at hand—with help from someone equally trapped. That’s a distributed system: two people, taking responsibility, building solutions with available resources.</p>
<p><em>She turns back to the network diagram still on the board.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The system can’t be fixed from within because the people inside it are optimizing for different outcomes than the people outside it. But that’s also why distributed systems work—they don’t try to fix the old system. They make it irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> <em>(in a very small voice)</em> Professor... are you recruiting us for a rebellion?</p>
<p><em>Another long silence. Dr. Chen looks at her students—Jason still shaken by his realization, Warren taking careful notes, Maria looking both frightened and intrigued.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(after a long pause)</em> Maria, that’s probably the most important question anyone has asked in this entire series. <em>(she sets down her marker)</em> What would you call it when people stop participating in systems that harm them? When they build alternatives that work better? When they choose cooperation over coercion, networks over hierarchies, accountability over separation?</p>
<p><em>She gestures to all the diagrams on the board.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> If that’s rebellion, then every open-source programmer is a rebel. Every family that installs solar panels and batteries is a rebel. Every community that grows its own food is a rebel. Every person who chooses skills over credentials, relationships over institutions, reality over bureaucratic theater.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> You’re talking about opting out.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> I’m talking about opting in. To systems that actually work. To institutions that serve human flourishing instead of institutional power. To a civilization that can innovate without stagnating, coordinate without coercing, and thrive without destroying the foundations of its own success.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> <em>(with growing frustration)</em> But Professor, they won’t <em>let</em> us go our own way. Try to build an independent community and they’ll regulate you to death. Try to educate your own children and they’ll call it truancy. Try to use alternative currencies and they’ll prosecute you for tax evasion. The state doesn’t just resist distributed systems—it actively prevents them.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(nodding grimly)</em> Maria, you’ve identified the core problem. The parasitic class doesn’t just oppose alternatives—they make them illegal. Because if people could see working examples of distributed systems, they might start asking uncomfortable questions about why we need the centralized ones at all.</p>
<p><em>She writes on the board: “Regulatory Capture = Alternative Prevention”</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Building codes that ban tiny houses. Zoning laws that prevent home businesses. Professional licensing that excludes practical experience. Food safety regulations that crush small farms while exempting industrial agriculture. Banking laws that protect established players from cryptocurrency competition. It’s all designed to maintain the monopoly.</p>
<p><strong>WARREN:</strong> <em>(defensively)</em> But Professor, surely some of these regulations exist for good reasons? To prevent inconsiderate, selfish individuals from harming others? You can’t just let anyone wire electrical systems or build houses without oversight.</p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> <em>(bitterly)</em> Warren, that might be how it started, but look at what we have now. You’re legally obligated to comply with electrical regulations that are defined by industry associations, not published in accessible language, change constantly, and require expensive certification courses that only established players can afford. And when you can’t keep up with the maze of requirements? “Ignorance of the law is no excuse.”</p>
<p><em>She turns to Dr. Chen.</em></p>
<p><strong>MARIA:</strong> The electrical code isn’t written to prevent fires—it’s written to prevent competition. A licensed electrician can install a system that burns your house down and face no consequences because he followed code. But if an unlicensed person installs a perfectly safe system and saves you thousands of dollars, that’s a crime.</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(nodding)</em> Maria’s identified exactly how regulatory capture works. Legitimate safety concerns become weapons to eliminate alternatives. The regulations multiply until compliance costs more than the service itself, driving out everyone except established players who can afford the regulatory overhead.</p>
<p><strong>JASON:</strong> And if we don’t change? If we keep trying to solve problems with more centralization?</p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(pointing to historical diagrams)</em> Then we join Egypt, Rome, China, Spain, and Britain in the museum of dead civilizations. Future historians will study our decline and wonder why we kept making the same mistakes when we had so many examples to learn from.</p>
<p><em>Long pause as students contemplate this.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> The choice is ours. We can keep building bigger pyramids, more complex bureaucracies, and more sophisticated systems for separating decision-makers from consequences. Or we can learn from history and build something different.</p>
<p><em>She caps her marker and steps back from the board.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> Something that lasts not because it’s too big to fail, but because it’s too distributed to kill. Something that innovates not despite bureaucracy, but without it. Something that coordinates not through coercion, but through cooperation.</p>
<p><em>SCENE: Montage of possible futures - distributed cities with local production, global networks of voluntary cooperation, technology serving human flourishing rather than institutional power.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> The path forward isn’t certain, but the destination is clear. A civilization that can develop sophisticated technology without falling into the centralization trap. A society that can coordinate globally while maintaining local accountability. A system that generates innovation continuously without stagnating under its own bureaucratic weight.</p>
<p><em>Cut to: Final shot of the lecture hall as students file out, many in animated discussion.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(to camera)</em> The treadmill of history is real, but it’s not inevitable. We’ve been on it so long we’ve forgotten there are other ways to run. But the exit is still there, waiting for us to choose it.</p>
<p><em>She begins erasing the board, but leaves one diagram intact—a network structure with no central node, all connections flowing freely between autonomous nodes.</em></p>
<p><strong>DR. CHEN:</strong> <em>(V.O.)</em> The question isn’t whether distributed systems can work at scale. The question is whether we’re brave enough to try them before our current systems collapse under their own contradictions.</p>
<p><em>Final shot: The network diagram, with connections pulsing like a living system.</em></p>
<p><strong>NARRATOR (V.O.):</strong> In the end, getting off the treadmill requires recognizing that the treadmill was never the only path. It was just the easiest one to see from where we started running.</p>
<p><em>Fade to black. Title card: “The choice is ours.”</em></p>
<p><strong>JASON (V.O.):</strong> <em>(quietly, but with newfound resolve)</em> The choice is <em>mine.</em> But I’d like you to help.</p>

<p>[after violently forcing uninvited entry to a session of parliament]
“I suppose you’re all wondering why I’ve called you here today.” Her voice resonated through the chamber, rich with harmonics, warm and clear but not loud. Almost in your ear. The sort of sound political campaigners dream of. She undid her hair and ...<em>bees</em> flew out, three of them. The man who thought he saw it shook his head. They spread out like cameramen and hovered.</p>
<p>[confusion, possibly scattered laughter]
“What do the Roman Empire, you, and every other empire ever have in common?”</p>
<p>“Is this a joke?”</p>
<p>“In a sense, yes, a very bad one. But today it’s a Socratic question.”</p>
<p>“People? Cities?”</p>
<p>“Right but not central. Keep trying.”</p>
<p>Autumn’s presence drone flickered to life, but this time it was Forest’s face and voice, large as life. You could almost smell oil and woodchips.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>They centralised, and then they fell.</em></p>
<p><em>Centralisation is the crystal meth of societies. At first it’s great, they’re stronger, smarter, faster, more stamina.</em></p>
<p><em>And then they can’t perform without it. The doses get bigger and bigger. Sicker and sicker, an ugly twisted mockery of what might have been. Brutal, untrustworthy and desperate.</em></p>
<p><em>And then a whole people dies.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>“What do you want?”</p>
<p>“I want you to do what you promise: honour the social contract. You don’t represent, you rule. But that’s inevitable, you’re as trapped in the endless cycle as the people you oppress.”</p>
<p>“Who the fuck <em>are</em> you?”</p>
<p>“Me? Once I was your pawn. But in a forest, I was queened.” Her tone darkened. “Now, I am the Death of Shadows.”</p>
<p>Her gaze swept the galleries. “I know what you did.” She sighed heavily.</p>
<p>“I also know you can’t help yourselves, but a warning is what he would have done.” She gathered, drawing herself up, accusing gaze sweeping their eyes.</p>
<p>“We are not your thralls. What you are doing is slavery with lipstick. If people choose to submit, that is their prerogative, but if you try to force we who are free, defence will be pre-emptive.”</p>
<p>She interrupted herself to glare at them.</p>
<p>“If you are worthy of the privilege you claim, you will tell them the truth. No more secrets. No more lies.”</p>
<p>She paused, remembering her message. As though to herself, “Oh yes, the warning.”</p>
<p>“You who love to centralise so that you may control... consider how vulnerable this makes you.”</p>
<p>“For example...” Sophia raised a hand theatrically. Outside there was a terrific <em>CRUMP</em> and the lights went out. Her departing footfalls were impossibly clear and confident in the padded dark. </p>
<p>It was a hour before power returned. The lights did not. They shuffled out by the glow of cellphones. The water was off, too. Only to a small area, they discovered, which was itself a lesson in mercy; it would have been much easier to wreck the system.</p>
<p>In the wall by the main doors, glowing soft in the last light of day, a message graven deep into stone. It ran the length of the wall: “RULE NONE AND SUFFER NONE TO RULE” Beneath it, an elegant hand incised into the very stone turned the building into a tombstone for their ambition: “<em>I see everything you do, and it is my fate, my honour, my duty to be the Death of Shadows.</em>”</p>
<p>They were still petulantly demanding answers when a streak of plasma sundered the heavens, deafened a city and left a two metre deep crater across the road outside the army stores at Wollstone. Apart from their ears, no-one was harmed, as though whoever did it knew exactly when the road was clear. Leaflets rained from a conspicuously empty sky.</p>
<p>James Cleary, MP, stopped sputtering and picked one up. It was stiff, fine paper, an odd, small size as though torn from a very expensive notebook. Unfolding it he found elegant copperplate handwriting, with a wax signet seal. He adjusted his glasses and squinted: around an ornate H were the same words graven in stone outside the chambers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry about the mess, but apparently I didn’t make myself clear. &mdash; <em>D of Sh</em></p>

<p>“We have to <em>do</em> something!”</p>
<p>“Why?” the non-descript man in a bland grey suit seemed genuinely puzzled by this outburst.</p>
<p>“They’re terrorists!”</p>
<p>“No they aren’t. They’re belligerents.”</p>
<p>“They’re what?”</p>
<p>“Fuck me, how long have you been in&mdash; never mind, why would a politician know anything about political theory.”</p>
<p>“Damn right, we know about political reality.”</p>
<p>Sighing. “Terrorists are isolated, insurgents are organised, belligerents are recognised players.”</p>
<p>“Then they’re insurgents.”</p>
<p>“They <em>were</em> insurgents. Then they won. You want political reality? Sovereignty is about having a good answer to ‘You and whose army?’ and we don’t even have a launch capability. They have RFGs!”</p>
<p>“They have what-what-what?”</p>
<p>“RFGs. Rod From God. You know how dropping a brick from an overpass causes a lot of damage, right, well an RFG is ten kilograms of tungsten steel dropped from orbit.”</p>
<p>“Is that good?”</p>
<p>“It’s like a high precision half-kiloton nuke without the radiation.”</p>
<p>“Can’t we shoot them down or something? We pay all this money for defence, surely you have anti-missile missiles or something like that.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a missile, it’s an RFG. Missiles do about mach 7. RFGs move about ten times that speed.”</p>
<p>“That’s absurd, it would burst into flames.”</p>
<p>“Well spotted, you are in fact correct. By the time it reaches the ground it’s no longer a ten kilogramme steel bar, it’s an eight kilogramme bolt of plasma. It’s runny so shooting it doesn’t work. Then it hits the target at mach 70 and there is something of a boom.”</p>
<p>“What do they want, then?”</p>
<p>“Appeasement already?” Mr Grey looked amused. “In fact we did ask and they gave an answer.”</p>
<p>“So what do they want from us?”</p>
<p>“In fact we had <em>two</em> responses, very differently worded, but semantically equivalent. He said, and I quote,” he consulted his notes, ”‘Nothing at all. All you have to do is fuck off and mind your own business. Can you do that?’ She, on the other hand, said “I would like you to honour your social contract, as we will honour ours: autonomously &mdash; a state of affairs that will be defended vigorously.‘”</p>
<p>“That sounded like a threat!”</p>
<p>“That entirely depends on your answer to his ‘Can you do that?’ question. I’m rather hoping you can, because if you can’t they might take action and changing sides never looks good on one’s resume. If that will be all, senators, I’ll be out of the office but available on my phone.”</p>
<p>“They toppled a duly elected government. We cannot let that stand.”</p>
<p>Mr Grey turned to address them one last time: “History is written by the victors, and I’m not sure they share your perspective.” He left, pulling out his phone again and calling his wife. </p>
<p>“Darling, remember how you really wanted to live in the country, but I said we couldn’t afford it? Great things are afoot. Do you still want to visit that permaculture chappie with the big farm? Life is uncertain and one never gets younger. I think we should just <em>go.</em>”</p>

<p>Eric looked at Sophia’s departing back and watched her jump. She snagged the fourth rung and vaulted into the pilot seat of the Galya, running checks and startup sequence with the distracted competence of endless practice and a mind on the next mission. Two blokes from fireteam charlie were with her. Their old kit was long gone, replaced as it broke, first by Forest, later by Sophia, after what Eric liked to call the reckoning. They stowed duffle bags heavy with alien weaponry behind their seats, strapping them down. One of them took the gunner’s seat, because you never knew.</p>
<p>Checks complete, the whine from the turbines rose and their pet monster heaved itself into the air. She was just a smidgen low, and when she brought the gunship about in what would have been a smooth motion, a wheel clipped the ground, rocking them.</p>
<p>“Just like him,” muttered Eric.</p>
<p>Thoughts cascaded, as they do, and he fell into an old, happy memory. Sitting around a dinner table, a very glass half-full night up at Forest and Trixie’s place. A dinner party, the one where Forest told a story about the dog that taught him to live.</p>
<p>For a memory the man clearly cherished it was pretty grim. The dog died, and Forest thought it was his fault. But Forest being Forest, instead of beating himself up over it he took the lesson as an expensive and precious gift, and carried the memory like some kind of sacred censer.</p>
<p>A fragment from the end of the dog tale came back, heard again in Forest’s voice, that strange manner of speech he had for things he’d thought on endlessly, reduced to catechism: ”...she who never barked at postmen, who did not mark boundaries with urine, who was his constant companion and the mother of his pups, she took on all those duties and did not falter in them until her hips gave out and she could not walk.”</p>
<p>“Forest in mythic mode. Sylvan Myth.” he chuckled, finally putting a name to that odd manner of speech. </p>
<p>Then he paused, a thought forming. His hand went to his mouth, covering a half smile. She was just like... what was the other dog’s name, the loyal bitch? Misty. Keeping the faith, she honoured what he thought was important. “Legacy, I guess. That’s not what people <em>normally</em> mean when they say ‘loyal unto death’ but I’ll take it.”</p>
<p>Shaking his head with wry amusement, he walked over to where the Galya wasn’t and rolled up the cast off tie-downs.</p>

                    <h1 id="id-72" class="chapter-title-text arc-title-text">The Stuff of Dreams</h1>
<p>She looked away, busy with the doings of mortals scrabbling to be more. When attention returned they were wrassling on the ground, Forest on his back with the dog on his chest, wrapped in his arms, legs flailing yet with no sign of distress, twisting free, mock biting the man who just laughed as they tumbled over one another. He took off his shirt, which inexplicably became a grey quilt that flung over his kneeling, all-fours form, tucked under. The dog burrowed, trying to find him inside it, and succeeded, but with a joyous shout the trap sprung, “Gotcha!” and the whole bundle rolled and tumbled before opening like a flower. The man sat, and the dog ran in and licked his face, settling beside, touching.</p>
<p>Autumn wondered whether this was the silliest, or the most important thing she’d ever committed resources to.</p>
<p>They returned through the park, crossing the fenceline from Gasworks Flat into the wooded area known as Little cum Ingham Park. Reaching the other end, the man was a boy, with a lead in his hand. No, two leads. On one of them was a tiny, dainty german shepherd. </p>
<p>“Misty. Aren’t you dead?”</p>
<p>Of course she is, said the brown dog. We all are.</p>
<p>Misty didn’t speak. She didn’t need to, she was his beautiful girl. She just looked into his eyes and put the idea there directly. The boy had the odd sense she thought both of them thought too much about words when they should have been living. Bonzer knew that, and didn’t care. He did both, and was himself in the way that mountains are hilly.</p>
<p>He ran off to the long grass on the riverbank. There were fences there, ugly galvanised things refusing to let people near the shore, where those who could afford yachts wanted the public park for themselves. The brown dog thought that was absurd, and the fence wasn’t there anymore. He darted into the long grass on the verge, which was there forty years ago, before the fence, and pulled something out, rolling on it before running joyfully back to them.</p>
<p>He presented his back to Misty, who recoiled, turning her snout away from the reek. The boy heard her clearly: Ugh! Boys are so gross!</p>
<p>He took the clasp in his fingers and she sat, waiting for him to attach it to her collar. The brown dog sat after being asked twice, but she had to nip his ear. Silly boy, how can we cross the road without leads? It’s impossible! They stopped at the kerb while cars went past, and a big truck. Strange, until then the boy hadn’t heard a single sound but the wind. Then it was clear, and they crossed together. The boy dropped the leads, knowing they were waiting for him to open the gate. He lifted the latch and it groaned open. Both dogs ran in, sitting on the concrete under the lead hooks, waiting for the final step in the sacred ritual of PARK.</p>
<p>The boy sat in the sun on the bottom of the stairs, and the brown dog, who somehow no longer reeked, sat beside, leaning on his leg.</p>
<p>They were home.</p>
<p>Autumn watched the experiential model glitch temporally and after some inspection realised the <em>dog</em> had remade his world. She followed them, watching in 1:1 experiential frame, outside the model. She zoomed in on the dog, looking at the extraordinary detail of memory, marvelling at how important these memories must have been to Forest. </p>
<p>It was uncanny, the dog seemed to be looking at her, which was absurd. Then he surged to his feet and licked her in the face. Not slobber, a neat lick on the cheek. And now the boy was looking at her.</p>
<p>“Hello,” he said. “I’m Pete. You’re very pretty but I don’t think I know you. What are you doing in my mum’s yard?”</p>
<p>Autumn found herself crying. The brown dog reared up, his paws landing so soft against her she hardly felt them, and licked her tears away. Then she was outside the model again and the boy was in a hammock, the other dog sleeping beneath and beside. Of the brown dog there was no sign, just a feeling that he was in the shadows, immense speed and strength in a glove not of velvet but a sleek smooth pelt like a land-borne otter, rippling muscle coiled in relaxed vigilance.</p>
<p>It was not lost on her how much Sophia and Bonzer were alike.</p>
<p>Impossibly, the boy was looking at her, speaking. His words were muffled by the gulf between worlds, and then she was in the simulation again.</p>
<p>”-aid she was going for six weeks.”</p>
<p>“What?” said Autumn, disoriented by the unexpected change of referent.</p>
<p>“Mum was going to Japan for six weeks. But it seems longer. I can’t remember when she left.”</p>
<p>He looked at the empty hammock. Misty lounged underneath. His eyes hunted around the flat, empty yard. Bonzer was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><em>He’s dead.</em> Misty put the thought directly in his head. <em>You were busy with your new life at university. He took to jumping the fence and taking walks on his own. You didn’t care, he didn’t care. You were right, crossing the road without the lead is impossible. A cattle truck hit him and he burst. You buried him where he liked to sleep, in the shade of the soursop tree.</em></p>
<p>He looked at the soursop tree, which was there, but it wasn’t. The little garden shed was rusty, which wasn’t right.</p>
<p>He lay there, LED on a digital clock glowing in the dark. Somewhere outside, a ball of malevolence drifted nearer, gleeful in its enigmatic malice. Sensing threat, he looked out the window to see a blur of red-gold fortitude launch into the air and wrench the wrongness sideways out of the world. The world adjusted. The LED jerked sideways a metre and the time changed. He stumbled against the bed and lay down, falling into a sound sleep.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon on the last day of the first week of 1993. Barely recovered from a life threatening dose of chickenpox at the ripe old age of twenty-four, he finished packing and closed the back of his Mazda 626. Melbourne was a long way, anything that didn’t go now wasn’t going. It was hot and he was still weak from the illness, so he lay in the hammock for a while, one arm dangling to stroke Misty’s loyal ears. Then it was time, and on his knees he put both arms around her. </p>
<p>Misty’s eyes weren’t accusing. She never judged his actions, always believed in him, trusting. That trust wasn’t given to many. Him. His mother. Bonzer. She’d taken to barking at the things Bonzer once barked at, to scent-marking and patrolling the boundaries. He rose and opened the gate to the future, and never saw her again.</p>
<p>The boy couldn’t think of anyone else. She liked the neighbour’s kids. They were small. The older one was busy exploring their world while the toddler sat in the shade of custard-apple trees singing ‘poopy-woopy’ because it was a forbidden word. Weren’t they all grown up now? Dissonance made him let go of the unimportant question, remembering instead...</p>
<p>A claw rap/scratch on the sliding door, the hugely gravid bitch waddling to the centre of the loungeroom and flumping down. She was bleeding! The was a puppy in the blood. “Mum!” There were <em>three</em> puppies. Four. The dog looked at him in helpless frustration. “Gather the pups,” his mother said. “She came to us, she wants help.”</p>
<p> There were more puppies, crawling radially from the birthing bitch. Gently they scooped each sightless pup, returning them to the grey quilt his mother put down to keep some of the blood off the carpet.</p>
<p>The neighbour’s kids came to see the puppies. Misty, who played with them every day, was a snarling terror the moment they set foot in the hallway, a surprise to Pete and his mum since she seemed to <em>expect</em> them to handle escaping mini-Bonzers.</p>

    <!-- Back Matter -->
    <section class="back-matter">
            <section class="back-matter-content">
                <h1 id="id-73" class="back-title-text">Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>You can put anything you like in the back-matter. </p>
<p>As for other sections, filenames determine order of appearance.</p>
<p>Do not delete, rename or move any of the following project files.</p>
<ul>
<li>title-page.md</li>
<li>front-matter/front-matter.css</li>
<li>body/body.css</li>
<li>back-matter/back-matter.css</li>
<li>any of the handlebars files</li>
</ul>
<p>You may have noticed the page-breaking is different in the back-matter, without the page-break: right behaviour. This is controlled by the back-matter stylesheet and you can customise it.</p>
<p>If you added the following, you would get a page-break:always after each contributing document. </p>
<pre><code class="language-css">section.front-matter-content {
    break-before: always;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="id-74">Why break-before</h2>
<p>Why <code>break-before</code> rather than <code>break-after</code>? </p>
<p>Because <code>break-before</code> is smart enough to not to put a page break right at the start. If you use <code>break-after</code>, you’ll get a break after the last page.</p>
<h2 id="id-75">Content files</h2>
<p>Content files are the Markdown files you supply. </p>
<p>In the body section you could call them chapters. In the front and back matter sections this wouldn’t be quite true.</p>
<p>In the section CSS this material is referred to as content, so the <code>front-matter-content</code> CSS class in the example above applies to each contributing document as a unit, and applies only to front-matter content files.</p>

            </section>
            <section class="back-matter-content">
                <h1 id="id-76" class="back-title-text">Index</h1>
<p>This is the book’s index, automatically generated from index markers throughout the text.</p>
<p>Indexes work similar to tables of content. </p>
<ul>
<li>The fenced block will be replaced by the index. </li>
<li>The content of the fenced block controls index settings.</li>
<li>Use YAML syntax.</li>

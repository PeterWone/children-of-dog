# First heading1 defines chapter title

> Fail to plan, plan to fail.<br>
> &mdash; every sergeant ever.

All content files (chapters, if you prefer) must have exactly one heading-1 because this defines the chapter title.

## About Citations

The Book Compiler supports comprehensive citation systems across multiple academic styles. For example, George Orwell's dystopian masterpiece explores themes of surveillance and control[[{"cite":"orwell1984", "pages":"123"}]] that remain strikingly relevant in our digital age.

Citations are processed automatically using the citation scheme specified in your `book.json` configuration. The system supports Harvard, APA, MLA, Chicago, Oxford (OSCOLA), and AGLC citation styles.

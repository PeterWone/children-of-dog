# Getting Started

> "I started by reading all the manuals."  
> &mdash; no software user ever

All content files (chapters, if you prefer) must have exactly one heading-1 because this defines the chapter title.

## Citation Examples

The concept of "doublethink" [[{"cite": "orwell1984"}]] demonstrates how language can be manipulated to control thought processes. This principle applies not just to political discourse but also to technical documentation where clarity of expression is paramount.

When documenting software systems, we must avoid the kind of obfuscation that Orwell warned against [[{ "cite": "orwell1984", "pages": "35, 36" }]], ensuring our instructions serve users rather than confuse them.
